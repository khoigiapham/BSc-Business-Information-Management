# Applied Deep Learning on Mobile Games Icons (ANN, RNN, CNN) ðŸŽ®ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

## Description

This project is divided into four distinct parts. The first part aims to understand and manipulate the "17K Mobile Strategy Games" dataset from Kaggle and apply traditional machine learning techniques. The second part focuses on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for a unique problem setting. The third part hones experience and intuition around neural networks and observes the effects of parameter selection. Finally, the fourth part aims to implement a deep neural network solution involving convolutional neural networks (CNN).

Detailed requirements can be found in the 'Challenges' files. 

The script can be found in 'Code' files. 

The written results can be found in 'Report' files.
