"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! The staff are helpful, kind, caring and wonderful! I'm still here and planning a return visit. They can't do enough for you. They're a credit to their bosses. Our room has been cleaned everyday, with fresh towels for the beach. The staff have helped us organise trips and get better deals! They really look after you.",2
"Absolutely beautiful hotel with amazing staff who were incredibly helpful and couldn't do enough to help and only a 5 minute walk to the beach, restaurants and bars, as well as the bus stop where the buses run every 30 mins to Fira and Oia",5
"The staff at 28 Boutique Hotel are the best that we have ever met, nothing was too much trouble and they were always ready and willing to help and advise. The local buses are good 1.80 euro per journey.   Room Tip: We liked our room which overlooked the mountains and got the early evening sunshine, perfect for sit... See more room tips",3
"What a fantastic experience! This hotel has everything, amazing staff, gorgeous pool, super cool atmosphere, beautiful rooms and just a hop and a skip away from the busy Kamari strip. It's about 5 minute walk from the main strip but you'll be glad not to be in the thick of things, this place is truly a sanctuary and the best!!",2
"We stayed here for a week at the beginning of May. This was the start of the season, the staff were full of enthusiasm and very friendly and helpful. Despite the fact our thomson rep came to the hotel every morning we still went to the hotel staff for advice and recommendations for the island. They booked reservations for restaurants we visited and also arranged car hire for us. The hotel itself is very clean and tidy, you are welcomed into a courtyard area with palm trees and rustic seating areas. The reception is nice and bright and clean with a massive bookshelf full of books that you can borrow during your stay. Breakfast area is nicely organised and the food is very good. There is a large varied selection and always plenty available. You can sit indoors or out to eat, the outdoor area is on a terrace overlooking the pool and entrance courtyard. Very nice and peaceful with views of the mountain.The room we had was 305. Third floor on the pool side. We had sea views, pool view and mountain views. It was so nice, plenty of room, very tidy and lovely modern decor. Nice big double shower in the en suite. The room was cleaned every day. The pool area is very comfortable. Large double size sun beds on 3 sides of the pool with the pool bar on the other side. Pool bar serves lunch, snacks and drinks. Plenty of selection and all at a reasonable price. We ate lunch here a couple of times and it was very nice food. Highly recommend this island to visit but make sure you stay at this hotel. It was the perfect stay for us, we loved the location of the hotel, it was handy for covering all parts of the island and the seafront of Kamari is a 5 minute walk. We enjoyed every minute at this hotel and would love to return.",4
"The staff at this hotel are some of the friendliest we have ever encountered. They went above and beyond to make sure the holiday was the best it could be, recommending places to go, advising on how best to get there, making restaurant reservations and booking taxis etc.The hotel is very pretty, and the location is ideal, as it is set back enough from Kamari itself to ensure that you are not overlooked by passers-by, which seems to be the case with most hotels on the island. You also get to use the facilities of the sister hotel, Bellonias Villas, which is right by the beach, with its own beach area and sunbeds. It was the ideal set up. It was also nice to come back to the quiet of the hotel, after busy days in Fira, Oia etc. Breakfast was lovely, with plenty of selection, and the lunch/bar menu was very good. The Greek salad at the hotel was the best we came across on the island, as were the cocktails! Thanks Vasso!Our favourite restaurant in Kamari was To Pinakio, which was recommended to us by the friendly taxi driver who collected us from the airport. A lot of locals also eat there, which is always a good sign. It was the only restaurant we decided to visit twice, because the food was so good and the cost was very reasonable. On both occasions our bill, with wine/beer, came to about 38 Euros for two. With had a delicious meal at Argo in Fira (as recommended and booked by Aggie), with a bottle of Santo Nykteri . We both like a New Zealand sauvignon, or Sancerre, and thought this particular wine was very good. In Oia we dined at Melitini one evening, where the food was delicious and very reasonable. We enjoyed the beautiful sunset from our table on the roof terrace. We also had lunch at Dimitri’s at Ammoudi Bay. It is quite a trek down (and up again!), but it is worth it for the stunning view, right by the clear blue water.In our week on the island we visited Fira, made the hike from Fira to Oia (long and difficult, but stunning views – Oia is beautiful, but definitely has a more ‘polished’ feel), saw the more rustic Santorini at Pyrgos, and also visited Santo Winery for wine tasting and nibbles, whilst taking in the spectacular views (not to be missed)!Getting around was very easy by bus, and Aggie explained all about this on our second day, and packed us off with a bus timetable and map. Aggie and the team are so helpful and very happy to help with anything. We really had a wonderful time, and we hope to visit again",7
"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights. The room was a good size, clean, with one of the nicer hotel bathrooms we had in Greece. We really enjoyed the breakfast. The location was excellent. Yes, you have to walk down and then up a reasonable hill to reach a number of the restaurants. But, you're also just a few minutes from the Acropolis. That means, no taxi required to see Plaka, Syntagma Square, etc. Most impressive was the girl who worked the front desk in the late afternoons and evenings. She was incredibly helpful and kind. Honestly, we would have made several bad sight-seeing choices if not for her. By the way, we had a 3rd story balcony with views of the sea one way and the Acropolis the other way. We had dinner on the balcony one night and really enjoyed it.",0
"LocationGood location but as the name suggests it's an uphill walk to the hotel. This was fine for me but be aware some people may struggle, especially in the high temperatures. Also there is not much pavement to walk on near the hotel and lots of parked cars, so at times you have to walk in the road next to the parked cars - just be very aware of moving traffic. We walked to the Parthenon in about 10-15 mins. You can also reach a number of restaurants within the same walking distance. Plaka district and market about 20 mins walk. We also walked about 10 mins to the nearest tram stop and took the tram to the beach. It's about 1.40 euros per person each way and although it took about 45 mins to an hour, it was a good way to see more of the area.HotelThe staff were very friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy. Very tiny lift - I think it said 5 people max. There were 2 of us in it with 2 suitcases and it was a very tight squeeze. We were on the 2nd floor, no view from the room but this didn't matter as we were only in there to shower and sleep! Size of room was just average, bathroom ok with a big walk-in shower. Bit of a squeeze opening the bathroom door as it was so near the bed. Only found 1 English speaking channel on the TV. There is a fridge - not stocked, a safe in the wardrobe and room was clean. No tea/coffee making facilities.If you go up the 5th floor there is a roof terrace with stunning views of the Acropolis and the city. I went up there at night to take some photos of the Acropolis when it is all lit up. There is a small swimming pool on 1st floor but didn't use it.BreakfastHot buffet was bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs. Cold options were Greek salad, cereal, fruit, yogurt, breads, cakes and pastries. Nothing special but it was good enough, and the breakfast room looked clean and well kept. It's a good, well located hotel if you're going to be out most of the day and want somewhere clean and comfortable to rest.",0
"We paid €260 for two nights which is a decent price for a hotel in a capital city I suppose. The room was quite small, maybe that's par for the course in Athens? We had a view of the Acropolis from our balcony but I think every hotel in Athens does as its so prominent. Breakfast was uninspiring, we barely ate anything. We booked fairly last minute so I guess this was all that was left! Wouldn't be bothered about coming back here should we return, would try somewhere else. Staff were all friendly though, just like everyone else in Greece!",0
"We have just stayed 3 nights at the Acropolis Hill, and couldn't recommended it more highly.We are traveling with our 21mth old child and all the staff were beyond fantastic. New modern facilities, fantastic greek style/ modern hot breakfast included, pools and on site cafe/bar. All the staff are incredible knowledge with local attractions and hotspot. They all treat as us part of the family. Katerina went above and beyond for us, meeting any need we ask of her. We have a sick family member in hospital, she spoke to another family member in Greek, translated and wrote down all the information we needed. To the management and staff at Acropolis Hills, a huge thank you for making our stay in Athens memorable.Highly, highly recommend this wonderful place to stay if you want to be treated as part of the family",0
"Nice small, clean hotel with almost all facilities required. Descent breakfast, small but clean outdoor pool, fast and reliable wifi, bad TV channels, very close to Acropolis, National Garden and Panathinaiko Stadium. Not far from metro station. Rooftop area on the 5th floor is a nice place to observe Acropolis at night.",0
"Location - The location is the highlight of this hotel!!! There are restaurants right down the hill adjacent to the hotel, in addition to little stands for snacks, a bakery, and a florist for flowers for your loved ones. You can indeed see the Acropolis from your room. It will take you 15 minutes to walk to the front entrance of the Acropolis.Transportation - Taxi is 44 euro from the airport to the hotel. The hotel staff will call you a taxi at the frog desk when you need it and it will always be there in 10 minutes. Front desk staff speaks fluent English.Rooms - The rooms are small like any other European hotel BUT it looks nothing like the pictures. The bed spreads look outdated & not like the pictures. The lighting in the rooms are horrible for makeup. When you turn the power on in the room, by putting the card in, some lights make noise like there is a fuse issue. The showers are very very very small. You cannot move from one side to the other without brushing against something; I am very petite by the way. The rooms are clean, just make sure you don't drop a single crumb or ants will come immediately. The wifi was free and very strong.Breakfast - Breakfast is good, just don't expect a very American breakfast per say. Tons of bread items, fresh orange juice, try the spanakopita, could use more fruit options. Staff - The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly.Note to Guests: Keep the mindset of a boutique hotel and not a big hotel like a marriot or hilton, and you should be fine. Try to buy snacks outside of the hotel if you are a snacker; there's no mini bar.",0
"We recently stayed at Acropolis Hill Hotel on our trip to Athens for business during the weekend of 14-15 May 2016. The hotel was well groomed, clean and the room was small but had everything we needed. The bed was excellent and we slept vey well on Saturday night after a very tiring day indeed. We had such a good night's sleep that in the morning we felt lazy and did not want to get up for breakfast. We thought we would skip breakfast and have a late brunch in a cafe I know in town. We had breakfast upon arrival early on Saturday morning and although it was not bad my wife was not looking forward to it n Sunday again. When we asked the receptionist whether our Saturday breakfast could be covered by the Sunday one which we did not have she adamantly said that this was not possible from an accountant's point of view and that we should have arranged this in advance upon our arrival. Of course we paid the Saturday breakfast but her gesture destroyed the feeling for the hotel and we actually felt as if we were just accounting data rather than guests. We do not know whether the receptionist's zeal comes from her superiors or whether it is dictated by her own bureaucratic sense of duty but in any case such a detail that others would deem as minor destroyed the way we viewed the hotel for we always seek for small establishments with personalized service and this was definitely small but rather impersonal. Pity.   Room Tip: Rooms on the top floors offer good views to the town See more room tips",0
"This Hotel is perfect to explore Athens. Close to the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum and the main atractions. The rooms and the bathroom are small but tastefully decorated and clean. We had the room with view to Acropolis and it was great. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. All in all a very good experience.   Room Tip: Room 501 has a view to the Acropolis, which is great but with a very faint traffic noise in the back... See more room tips",0
"The Acropolis Hill Hotel is great if a) you are in good walking shape, b) you don't require much space and c) you're looking for a spotless, comfortable, modern hotel. The rooms are quite small, though certainly adequate, with nice bathroom, small balcony (most with a stunning view of the Acropolis), and comfortable beds. The hotel has a big rooftop terrace also with amazing views, a pool, very friendly and helpful staff, and a bar that serves wine, drinks, and coffee. A fine buffet breakfast and free wifi are included. It is walking distance from all the main attractions including the Parthenon, some museums, ancient sites, and the Plaka IF you are good walker who can handle steep climbs and uneven pavement. It is located across from the green Fillipapou Hill, so it's quiet and in a safe neighborhood with some good restaurants nearby. A great value and a fine choice.   Room Tip: Ask for a room with an Acropolis view. See more room tips",1
"we have 501 with awesome view at the acropole hill, also we was closer the exit door to terrace. The metro was at 7-10 min to walk. Services was great :, cleaning, bar , foods. we ll back next year in Athens and we ll choose Acropole Hill Hotel. thx   Room Tip: choose a room whit view at front hotel See more room tips",1
"The hotel was great - clean, quiet. Very close by Acropole.The room and the terase had a wonderfull view of Acropole. The breakfast was great, a lot of food nice quality. Very friendly people.I enjoied a lot staing at Acropole Hill Hotel.   Room Tip: Higher floors have a wonderfull view (5 or 6 level). See more room tips",0
"My wife and I spent 5 days in this hotel and found it ideal for access to the Acropolis as well as the metro system, as it was only 10 minutes from the nearest station. It is a 10 to 15 minute walk to the Parthenon entrance and right opposite the idyllic Filopappos Hill and its stunning views.Some good restaurants near the metro station, plus shops and bars.The hotel has 6 floors, the top ones especially affording great panoramas; Mousson Street is very quiet at all times as it is the highest street in the area despite being near the main Leoforos Andrea Syngrou Avenue with its trams and buses (in addition to the metro). The Street leads easily from the hotel to the usually vibrant and beautiful Dionysiou Areopagita pedestrian area right under the Acropolis. It may be a little steep down to the metro but most streets down have steps and are lovely to walk down with countless orange trees to walk under.Charming entrance and bar welcomes you to the hotel reception, and you are immediately struck by the very elegant decor found throughout the hotel. The same applies to the breakfast restaurant on the first floor next to the small outdoor pool.ALL the staff are brilliant and so helpful & kind. I will use the same hotel on a future visit.   Room Tip: Ask for upper floors; all rooms have a balcony. They either face the east and the city panorama or w... See more room tips",1
"The Acropolis Hill hotel is an excellent boutique hotel very close to the Acropolis. It is about a 9 minute walk to the ticket area. We spent 3 nights here and found it to be extremely clean and comfortable. The rooms are on the smaller side but they are nicely furnished with lovely bathrooms, a fridge, small desk and plenty of cupboard space. There is free WIFI which we found worked well. There are only 6 floors and the higher floors on one side have great views over the city. They are also very bright and all rooms have their own balcony. We stayed in Room 507 which was a double room and seemed to catch the sun all day. On the main entrance side, there is a view of the Acropolis but you need to go out onto your balcony to view it. Our son had room 502 on this side which was a little larger as I think it was a room that could accommodate 3 however it was not quite as bright. It also had a balcony. There is also a lovely roof top deck on level 5 where you are able to sit and enjoy the sunshine with a view of the Acropolis.Breakfast was included in our rate and it was very good. A good selection of cereals, yogurt, fruit, eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, pastries, juice etc. There is a pool which the breakfast room looks out on. It was not warm enough for us to use but I think it would be a welcome relief during the summer months. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.It is in a hilly part of Athens, so I would recommend a taxi on arrival as dragging cases up the hills and stairs could be difficult. However, once there, it is an easy walk to the Plaka district where there are many lovely restaurants and shops. We found walking around Athens extremely easy and the position of the Acropolis Hill hotel was fabulous. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.   Room Tip: Higher floors on the city side have good views of the city and are bright See more room tips",1
"Having visited several Greek islands this was our first trip to the capital. Lucky to have top floor with a view to die for of the Acropolis. Room was spotless and tended to daily. Very powerful shower always with hot water. Balcony opened up to view of Filopappos Hill , which unfortunately we didn't get the chance to visit, and a breathtaking view of the Parthenon,especially when illuminated at night. Level 5 had a great roof terrace with panoramic views of city. Breakfast buffet was a great start to the day including cold meats, bread,cereal, pastries , cooked bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs, yoghurt and wide range of hot drinks. Always well stocked and fresh.The hotel has an ideal location as nice and quiet area but near to all the main sites. Turning right out of the hotel and walking to where car park area is brings you to the fantastic pedestrian walkway. We found this by chance and was the safest way to get to all the main attractions. Turning right leads to Plaka area where lots of eateries and shops can be found. Also amazing new Acropolis Museum, and south slope attractions of Acropolis Hill. Turn left and you continue down to Monastriaki area for the Ancient Agora and flea market etc. Hotel has a limited snack service til 7pm and drinks available too if a little pricy but convenient.Highly recommended as a central safe area to stay and hope to visit again soon also good free wifi connection too. Staff were always very helpful ordering taxis if needed and one night even ordered a pizza for us when we'd had a very long day sight seeing.   Room Tip: Top floor but good views on all sides of either city or Acropolis See more room tips",1
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Mr. Haris was outstanding. He would do anything to help you. I had to leave early for my flight, and they arranged an early breakfast for me at 5:00am, and taxi. I particularly enjoyed the view of the Acropolis at night, what an amazing view from my room balcony.   Room Tip: Room 601 or 501 has the best view of the Acropolis from the balcony. See more room tips",1
"We've stayed in two different rooms here, which were quite different in size and view; though both were very small. Fantastic view of acropolis from the hotel Terrace and, I understand, from many of the private balconies. Very professional staff and consistently upscale details though it might almost qualify as a micro hotel.",0
"Th hotel is situated on a hill right next to a park. It is fairly close to the metro however you need to be aware that it is a steep way up. If you only have small luggage or are very fit you can still walk up though.We had a nice room with a view of the acropolis. It is very lovely. The room was clean, the ony downside was that it had 2 single beds next to each other, which led to a gap between the two mattresses which meant we slept kinda separated.The reception was very helpful and the breakfast buffet is small but good.",0
Great location hotel spot less room and shower really powerful and plenty of hot water great breakfast lovely hotel .staff excellent and extremely help full and friendly would recommend in a great location for sight seeing but quite steep lovely views from the hotel of the Acropolis thank you for a lovely holiday,0
"Our room -though rather small- was very well decorated, clean, modern and had amazing 180 degree views of the city. Wifi was free and a good speed and the breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice. Thank you to the front desk staff who were very helpful with all of our questions about the area.Just to echo what others have said about accessibility. Those with mobility issues, and those with small children in pushchairs would struggle staying at the hotel. The area is very hilly, also there is not a path running the whole way along the road at the top meaning having to walk in the road, especially dangerous with pushchairs or wheelchairs.",0
"A lovely boutique hotel. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. The reception staff were excellent, very friendly and welcoming and helpful with directions. It is at the top of a steep hill, so I wouldn't recommend if you have any mobility problems, but is is within a short walk of the main attractions in Athens,",0
"We only had four nights here but wish we could have stayed longer!The hotel is set on a small, narrow road away from the 'main stretch' which may not appeal to all but it is only a 5 minute walk from the Acropolis, museums, bars etc. The lobby has a lovely seating area and small but well stocked bar (with hot drinks) which serves throughout the day and evening. Rooms are exceptionally well decorated and furnished to a meticulously high standard. A safe and mini fridge are provided free of charge, the rooms also have a substantial tv (which we never used) and modern bathroom with hairdryer. Room service, towel changes and replenishment of shampoo and shower gel is daily unless unrequired.The rooms have a balcony, the higher ones overlooking the city) and there is a good size roof terrace with magnificent views of both Athens and the Acropolis.Rooms do not have tea/coffee facilities but we bought coffee from the breakfast area into our room or onto the rooftop early to have on the balcony before going to breakfast a little later with no problems. The breakfast is fabulous! A good selection of meats, cheeses, cereal, breads, fruits and pastries alongside cooked eggs, bacon/sausage and some locally produced candied style oranges and lemons - which I became slightly addicted to!There is a lovely pool but we did not try this out (hopefully next time!).The coast is about an hours walk or several buses go in that direction. The number 5 and number 3 trams (from the square) also drop off along the coastline. There is a lovely marina with cafes and shops or travel a little further to find some stunning little coves and some great 'on the beach' bars.It is unfortunate that the hotel does not have an option of dinner as on the rooftop this would be amazing! However, we did one evening bring our own food into the hotel to eat on the terrace without any problems what so ever.For close by dinning turn right when exiting the hotel then take the first right again (down some fairly steep steps/ramp), cross the road at the bottom and keep heading straight on for about 300 meters. Here you will find some lovely traditional Greek eateries, take-aways, cake shops/bakeries or is so desired burger houses (not a Mcdonalds in sight) :-)We can highly recommend the kebab shop on this road, my husband is well travelled and said it was the best kebab he had ever had, I'm a vegetarian and happily ended up with a crisp pitta bread full of salad and mint yoghurt (with chips(sorry))! This along with 2 large beers was under 10 Euros, very authentic Greek and incredibly tasty! The best I can write for the name of the kebab house is WHTONONEIO, of course this is Greek and some of the symbols differ but I'm sure you'll find it!Have fun!",0
"Overall, we had a great stay at Acropolis Hill Hotel! The room was very clean, new and spacious enough. Breakfast was included, was good and varied. The receptionists were very kind, always asked us if everything was ok and gave us precious recommendations (ex. cheapest way to get to the airport). Also the position is great: the neighborhood is quiet all main attractions are at a reasonable walking distance.The only thing that bothered us was the smoke smell we perceived at times in the room. I'm not sure if it came from the balcony below or if people smoked in their rooms (it seems quite common in Greece to smoke in restaurants as well) but I think there should be stricter rules on that!",0
"Really enjoyed our stay even thou it's up a hill...if you're dragging a suitcase can be hard work...but customer service made up for it especially receptionist Harris, he was really good when the TV in our original room was not working and he immediately offered us another room which was bigger as he saw we had a little one with us, he suggested a really good restaurant nearby and suggested our way back to the airport which was easy and cheap as my husband had his wallet stolen to save us money!! Thank you Harris!!",0
"Hotel was very clean. Room was not the biggest, but extremely comfortable and as an added bonus had a balcony with great views. Hotel is what it's name says, at the top of a very steep hill so it's maybe not suitable for the less able. Staff were very helpful and nothing seemed to much trouble for them. The breakfast buffet was excellent with something for every taste. So, would I stay here again? Definitely.",0
"I'd recommend to chose a room in the 6th (highest) floor, because then you can see the half city lying in bed. It is a very beautiful hotel and the breakfast is (considering greek standards) absolutely perfect!   Room Tip: I'd recommend to chose a room in the 6th (highest) floor, because then you can see the half city... See more room tips",0
"For traveling solo it is very good, that there are only two bed rooms in this hotel. So there is a lot of space in the room. This part of the town is quiet and friendly, not crowded. But walking five minutes, you are at the entry of the acropolis hill and the stops of the hop on and off sightseeing busses. Walking down to Placa takes 20 minutes on a nice and friendly pedestrian way. After having been here one year ago, I am happy to have chosen this perfect hotel again.   Room Tip: The rooms not to the street in the upper floors have a good view over athens. See more room tips",0
"I stayed 3 nights in Acropolis Hill Hotel and I am very satisfied with the choice. The room was spacious and very clean. Our room had a balcony with a view of the Acropolis, which is a big plus. The breakfast was excellent with lots of choices. The wifi in comparison to other hotels I've stayed in, was great (~20 mbps dl speed). The hotel has a nice rooftop with seating arrangements that overlooks Athens. If I have to be nitpicky, the hotel is in a residential area and one needs to walk 5/10 minutes to the nearest restaurant.",0
"located at an easily approachable place , under the rock of Acropolis. If you need an accommodation in Athens I strongly suggest y'all to go there. Clean place and approachable prices. We stayed for 1 single night and we had a plane to catch early in the morning , so we didn't make it to have a breakfast, but I assume that it wouldn't be disappointing.",1
"I adored my staying at this beautiful hotel. Everything was perfect. Fresh and beautiful decoration, very clean room and bathroom, good quality of the linens and of the mattress, unique view of Acropolis and very professional and helpful staff. I definitely will choose it again on my next trip to Athens.",0
"We picked this hotel having read no reviews, we decided on. It as it was close to a venue we were going to see Machine Head at. This was the reason for flying out here. Fantastic hotel. The whole place is beautiful as soon as you walk in the front doors. Air conditioned and very clean. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Our room was upgraded and was stunning, the only thing that took a while to get used to was the huge bathroom door that was completely mirrored (weird watching yourself showering and going to the toilet lol) saw the pool and pool area cleaned every morning. The breakfast was a good selection from scrambled eggs and sausages to cereal, fruit, pastries, cheeses and hams. The only downside I found was the very big hill to get to the hotel, normally wouldn't be an issue but as I have a bad knee it took it out of me.I would defiantly stay again.Fantastic views from the roof terrace and the wi-if worked fantastically.",0
This tiny modern hotel is simple in concept and execution. Do not expect masses of facilities. Acropolis view rooms are noisy. Very reasonably priced and ideal for overnighting where not much is needed.,0
"Our booking was done by our travel agent so we did not have any idea what to expect. When we arrived (early) we were checked in and immediately went to our room. As with most hotels in Athens, there were two king single beds together, which did not worry us. The room was well-appointed with plenty of space. NB: Tea and coffee making facilities are not allowed by law in hotel rooms from my understanding - similar to Italy. Breakfast was fabulous overlooking the pool. Refreshments were able to be obtained near reception if one needed a latte, tea, wine, or a cool drink of water. Roof-top garden had spectacular views. We will be going back to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.   Room Tip: Best views of Athens. See more room tips",0
"It was extremely nice and new looking inside and the staff was friendly, but the location was not the best. It was about a 15 minute walk from the bus parking lot at the base of Acropolis Hill thru a residential neighborhood with few street lights and even fewer sidewalks, we were always afraid of being hit by a car. And the only way there is an Acropolis view is from one half of the roof deck. No rooms in the hotel have a view. There was nothing else nearby to do in that neighborhood or that side of town so we felt sort of isolated. Would be better to stay in more central hotels in Plaka neighborhood instead. The breakfast buffet was nice with wide variety. One day we overslept and even though it was a half hour after breakfast was over, they still allowed us to pick from whatever they hadn't packed up yet which was very nice of them. And they didn't rush us at all. There is no clock in the room (which was really hard due to time zone change as well as not bringing our cell phones with us), and it was quite tiny but really we only slept and showered there so it was fine. Also our room was literally in the corner and far away from the elevator and stairs so we assumed it would be quiet, but we were wrong. We heard people knocking on the door next door to ours all night long every night (no idea what was going on in that room! LOL)   Room Tip: bring your own clock See more room tips",0
It is very close to acropolis. You can see it from the hotel's terrace. If you would like to go to the hotel from venizelos airport by metro you just do it to get off on acropolis station. Go and see it,0
"This is a great Hotel for people who are on a budget but also what to stay in clean, quiet and perfectly located Hotel. It's very easy to get to the Hotel from the airport. It's walking distance to Acropolis and Plaka. My room was clean though a bit small. Hotel is in a safe area and is very quiet. Staff was friendly.",0
"When we arrived to hotel, everything looked fine and the girl at the reception was very nice and friendly!! When we got to the room it turned out that it was with two twin beds instead of one big bed... When I went back to the reception to ask for changing this, unfortunately this was not possible as they were booked solid! As a couple I have to say that its very uncomfortable and for sure took some value of the whole experience.... Then the breakfast was ok , but for a place that is in a bit higher price class then other hotels I've been in Athens I was expecting a little more, then the ""cheaper"" hotels but this was surely not the case. Then, when I had to leave, catch a plane at 5u30am, I asked for a wakeup call at 3u10, the be able to take taxi to airport night-bus pick-up point...unfortunately this call never came and thankfully my girlfriend woke up at 3u30, so after rushing and getting ready I came down around 3u50 and I asked the guy why he didn't call, looked at his paper and simply said ""oi, I made mistake, I forgot""???!off course there was no more time for me to take the bus so i ended up having to take a taxi to the airport, which put me back another 50euro, when I said to the guy that he (the hotel) actually should pay for that he gave me a stupid degrading smile (not someone I would want working for me, very unprofessional and a bit incompetent) the same morning I heard from girlfriend who was still there that they just walked into the room without any announcement at all, to the awkward moment where she ask the person, what she was doing in the room without saying anything.... Not the best experience!!!! (Especially, because they are not so cheap ) there was no tea or coffee in the room, like they put on the pictures.... To be honest only the girl in the reception in the daytime seemed to live up to the expectation and friendliness.... I won't be going back there again!!",0
"So my husband and I were down in Miami for a business trip, and I found what I thought was the BEST deal. The hotel was decently priced at roughly $135/night (this is cheap for Miami, unless you could the roach motels). The pictures made the hotel look absolutely amazing, quite upscale even. Because my husband had a weeks worth of training to get to bright and early, I booked the ""Quiet Zone"" and the King Executive room. This room promised no housekeeping before 10:00 AM would be done on that floor, that there would be slippers in our room waiting for us, and that the hotel staff would not put families with children, or large groups on this floor. All reviews of this hotel made it sound absolutely amazing. So we get to the hotel, after several near accidents due to very aggressive drivers in Miami and a VERY bad location for the hotel. The parking lot is gated, this is inconvenient, but safe so I can forgive the inconvenience. We walked into the absolutely STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL hotel lobby that smells like somebody not only mopped the floors with Febreze, but likely painted the walls with it too (if you have severe allergies or breathing problems, I strongly recommend you do not stay here. The entire first floor smells like this). We checked in with very friendly staff who explain that because we paid for the breakfast and parking package (breakfast and parking are extra here), we would receive breakfast vouchers every morning to use at the buffet. We get to the room, its quite small. There are no slippers ( I didn't really need them, I just feel that if I pay extra for a room that is supposed to have slippers, I dang well better get my slippers). The air conditioner vent is literally right above the bed, which is terrible since it looks like it hasn't been properly cleaned in a while. Over the course of our first night, we realized that clearly, they must have put us in the wrong section. We can not only hear AND feel the planes as they fly over our hotel from our 4th floor room, but we can hear every conversation and door and elevator sound from inside our room. I will provide pictures of what we have determined is a huge part of the problem. The first morning there, we never received our breakfast vouchers so we asked the front desk for them. They were quite surprised we did not receive them as they had sent someone up to put it under our door(I checked before leaving the room, never happened). The breakfast SUCKS, especially considering the extremely high price of $17.95. I can get a much better and cheaper breakfast down the street at the local McDonalds. They use what they call ultra pasteurized eggs. These eggs taste absolutely horrible. The most tolerable thing at the buffet was the bagels and cream cheese. On our second morning, we did not receive our vouchers yet again. We went to the front desk and the woman had the nerve to insinuate that we must have been hoarding the vouchers, as if their breakfast was actually worth it. She claimed they had sent someone up to put the vouchers under our door yet again. Never happened. They reluctantly gave us the remainder of our vouchers for the week all at once to prevent this from happening again. This message is to the hotel manager: I recommend you look into this as I am sure my room is not the only one to have experienced this problem. I suspect perhaps you have someone on staff either slacking on the job, doesn't know how to read the room numbers, or is for some odd reason pocketing these vouchers for someone they know. On to the next problem... Although I loved the fact that I was almost the only person using the pool, I did not appreciate the safety hazard that was the very loose handle bar that leads people down into the pool. I also did not enjoy the view of the extremely unclean looking windows of the hotel. Every window looks like it has not been cleaned in over a year with nasty stuff running down each one. I do hope this helps anyone looking to stay at this hotel. Honestly, I feel overall that this hotel chain spent a lot of money to put on a shiny new veneer for the first floor to attract people and completely forgot to take care of the rest of the hotel.   Room Tip: The 4th floor is very noisy. Ask for a room far away from the elevator as the doors have absolutely... See more room tips",0
"Stayed from May 23 to May 25, 2016 due a shot visit to Miami. The Hotel is well located, very close from the Airport on Le Jeune Rd. We arrived around 2:00pm and welcome by a nice staff at the Front Desk. We noticed the clean atmosphere on the lobby, it smelled really good. After we did the check in process, we went up to the room and we really liked it. Very nice King Size Bed on the 5th floor ( as we booked), on the quite area of the building. Very Clean and decent space. Nice bathroom and amenities in room.During our stay we visited the Gym, which is located on the 2nd floor and it looks well equipped, the pool is on the same floor, kind of small but well maintained, also, we noticed a mechanical seat close to the pool ( it looks for impairment guests, if it is, is really nice from the Hotel to have this kind of facility).We booked our room with Breakfast included ( which is served from 6:00am to 11:00am) and it was amazing, very variated and different during the two days that we stayed here. Parking was safe and very secure. wi-fi was complementary because of my IHG Platinum Status but kind of slow. Right across the Hotel there’s a Restaurant called Latin Cafe 2000, is very good for Lunch and Dinner. DO NOT go the the Restaurant “Catch of the Day” cause is very expensive with rude staff ( read my review about this place)Check out was easy and quick.Just one thing, Reception staff should be more friendly and smile a little bit, they are so serious.",0
"After a long flight this was a great place to get a restful night sleep. The front desk staff is friendly. Check in was smooth and fast The hotel shuttle is very convenient. Public spaces are clean and in good condition.The restaurant has good food, great buffet selection. Alyssa provided an exceptional service. She made me feel like a valued guest which you cannot put a price tag on. Make sure to visit Alyssa at the Restaurant when you stay at this hotel! The staff is well trained and friendly. A bonus was the little package of creams left on the bed to enjoy. We look forward to returning anytime we fly into Miami.   Room Tip: Good Service.. See more room tips",0
"We had travelled a long way and needed peace and quiet and a good nights sleep. This was ideal...clean, quiet, spacious. the staff were good and very helpful, the room was comfortable, no complaints at all.",0
Just stayed here and it was a nice clean room with very courteous staff. It's an older hotel but it's kept up well. Very very close to the airport and they have an airport shuttle. Few places to eat within walking distance as well as small stores. Theater is also around the corner. Enjoy!,0
"Booked a room here for a q2 hr layover from Miami to ny and felt like we got the royal treatment. Despite our early flight, the hotel had boxed breakfasts, a shuttle, and wake up call ready for us. The room was clean and comfortable and the room service was excellent. First choice for future Miami stays.",0
We were there before a trip originating in Miami. The Hotel is convenient to Miami International (MIA) airport and clean. Staff was helpful and van to or from the airport good. Breakfast buffet was good not great. Several good restaurant within walking distance.   Room Tip: All seemed to be in the flight path but not very noisy See more room tips,0
"In the room there is special cream for travel tired patrons to rub on their legs, a hydrating face cream and an essential oil mist to get a good rest! The staff is great and I find this to be a great place to recuperate from a long trip or before you go.",0
"Why are Crowne Plaza hotels so great outside the United States and so run down here? Another Crowne Plaza, another tired, sad property. While the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was in need of remodeling. I guess I should rethink my domestic hotel selections.",0
"Buena Vista Lounge (Downstairs near lobby) is staffed with very impressive servers. Wilson and Carlos are consistently friendly, helpful and willing to make my dining experience perfect, every time. I have been there enough times that they know what I like and offer ""The usual?"". It's nice to have that personal touch that is often missing these days.",0
"I stayed one night this week at Crown Plaza, Miami. The hotel, itself, is attractive and clean - but - please remember, it is an airport hotel.At check in, I was taken care of by a very competent and friendly receptionist. At check out, there were two employees working the front desk. There were no guests at the counter or in line. When I got to the counter, the two employees looked up and saw me but continued doing whatever they were doing. In other words, the employees ignored me. After one minute of being ignored, I politely asked if someone was able to check me out of the hotel. In my many travels over the years at many hotels, this is a first time experience for me (being ignored by two employees at the reception desk).In the evening, there was only one restaurant open in the hotel. The restaurant appeared clean and the employees at the entrance were friendly. The menu looked inviting and it listed many items for selection. Unfortunately, the item I selected tasted awful. In addition to the meal tasting awful, the food was served in a large, tall bowl. Eating food served this way (in a tall bowl) is awkward. As it turned out, I took only a few bites of the food as the food was undercooked and not at all the tasty meal that I anticipated based on the description in the restaurant menu. I was at the hotel, one day and solely for a short meeting in Miami. I did not rent a car because of the short duration of my anticipated time in the city. However, I had some spare time and decided to take a walk to see the general area of the hotel. Surprisingly, there are signs as one exits the hotel stating “no pedestrian traffic” which means that in order to leave the hotel to gain access to the sidewalk in front of the hotel, it is necessary to cross a motor way that forbids pedestrian traffic. I asked the guard on duty about the sign and he said I could cross the area, “but be careful” about crossing. I went only for a short walk. The hotel is situated not far from Miami airport, in a commercial area, with heavy auto and truck traffic. The hotel is not in an area designed for walking or sightseeing. Therefore, I returned to the hotel after only a short walk. I was surprised at the wifi service at the hotel. I have Platinum status with this hotel chain. At other hotel loyalty programs, high-speed internet is included in the daily rate. However, there is a $10.00 daily charge for high-speed internet service at this hotel. This creates a “nickel and dime” impression of the hotel chain. I belong to several hotel brand loyalty programs. To my recollection, IHG is the only high-profile hotel brand that charges its top tier loyalty guests for high-speed internet. One more thing - I attempted to use the room safe. The combination on the safe in the room would not work despite repeated attempts. The safe is the traditional type found in many hotel chains where the safe locks with a combination selected by a guest. Despite the above issues, the hotel is a comfortable place to sleep provided a guest can ignore the above discussed items and provided the stay is a short stay. .",1
"The hotel staff is very friendly, from the moment you check in they make you feel at home. The breakfast buffet has a nice variety. The drinks and food at the bar are great as well. Nice location, clean and welcoming rooms. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! You should try the pomegranate- blackberry margarita at the bar, to die for",0
The staff there were extreamly friendly and helpful .the hotel its self is clean and great for a stop over the bedroom was clean and presented well .but the bathroom needs more of a up date .generally would recommend for a short trip or stop over .and a big thank you to the front office girls that where helpful ..,0
"This is my go-to hotel in Miami for my business trips. Check-in and out is friendly and speedy. I really like their fitness center And the restaurant- WOW! I had breakfast and dinner there and found the food to be absolutely delicious, the service is excellent especially their very friendly and charming supervisor Alyssa, and the ambiance of the place is wonderful. The rooms are old, but still comfortable and clean. I love how the outlets are everywhere and accessible. Free shuttle to the airport. I give this hotel very high marks for business travel.   Room Tip: excellent service See more room tips",0
"The hiring managers here really take their time to find the best and most dedicated team members. In particular, FRANCIANA and MARIA were the stars of the show and patiently, quickly, and skillfully handled every request. Amazing women!!",0
"clean, friendly staff. convenient , on time shuttle. buffet breakfast was greati travelled to miami several times and this was my best stay . it was relaxing and affordable for a hotel close to the airport and with the extras",0
"I am very pleased with this choice! The room was ready early, very clean.nice size tv and comfortable king-size bed. I walked in to a cool room and the front desk was very helpful. I like the fact that the smoking area is away from the front door.",0
Stayed here one night before an early flight out. Nothing spectacular nor nothing particularly bad either. I would not recommend staying here if you want to be near Miami sites but if you want to be near the airport this will do fine,0
"Good location for an overnight layover. You can walk to several restaurants or take the shuttle to the Dolphin mall. Small lobby and gift shop. Appreciate that if you are leaving very early they provide coffee in the lobby before the resturant opens.   Room Tip: Be careful of connecting rooms, airline crews stay here that can have irregular hours. I was kept up... See more room tips",0
"Neither good nor bad. It is what it is, a transit hotel with reasonable facilities but pricey. Everything is average. It is convenient for the airport but not easy to get to by car for the overseas visitor.!",0
"Stayed here for an overnight stay while flying home from Costa Rica. OK hotel with a nice shuttle, but nothing out of the ordinary. We of course had no car, so found the selection of restaurants available within walking distance very limited. Lots of flight crews sleep here.",0
"We stayed in this hotel for two nights. The shuttle bus was easy to find and the service was quick to the hotel. We were greeted by very friendly staff and provided a room efficiently. The room was well air conditioned, spacious, nice with good dark-out curtains for sleeping. Bed wasn't large but comfortable with extra pillows provided. They have fast internet too. They have a great Breakfast buffet but it took us 20mins to be seated because it is super busy, meaning they have good food! Really worth the wait. Delicious food, wide variety, the service was fantastic, Very friendly and accommodating staffs.. I wonder how they maintain their smile even if it is super crazy busy. especially the supervisor or the host “Allyssa” she’s very energetic, friendly and her smile brightens up the whole room. She makes sure that everybody is okay, and have everything they need in the table. We had dinner at the Buenavista Bar, i ordered the Churasco (Steak) very good! and my husband had the big and delicious chicken wings. and had chocolate cake for dessert. It was a very good dinner, and our server is Carlos, very attentive and friendly.Very Good food. Good Job to their Chef!Happy to recommend this place for the service, cleanliness, delicious food, and access to airport and would definitely stay here again!! <U+2028>   Room Tip: Choose the room on the pool side.

"I just had a wonderful stay at the Crowne Plaza Miami Hotel! Friendly staff (make sure you ask for Gloria at Cafe 950 or Jorge at the Buena Vista Lounge, they are the best!), Great service, Excellent food, Nice room & Great price!",0
If you are visiting Miami and plan to stay near the Miami Zinternational Airport then the Crowne Plaza is a great location. The hotel is clean and very friendly staff always respond with helpful information and a smile.The rooms are large and nice and live up to Crowne Plaza standards.Their is a restaurant and a bar area and a few very nice eating places within easy walking distance.The airport shuttle runs every 20 minutes 24 hours a day and seems to keep will on schedule minimizing waiting timesAn overall good experience.,0
"We returned to Anastasis after a gap of 8 years after our first visit in 2008. I do not revisit many places but I always wanted to come back to this almost magic small boutique hotel. And again Despina and her team exceeded expectations. The tranquility, peacefulness but above all, kind attention we were so impressed with is all still there. Now Anastasis has its own Spa as well which is truly gorgeous. The view is like no other and the breakfast the best I have ever had anywhere. This place is perpect for honeymooners like we are now for almost 20 years. We will be back when the wind blows from the north....",0
This complex has some of best views and service anywhere. Delightful. The breakfasts are outstanding and the staff charming. The room was lovely and cleaned impeccably. For a relaxing holiday it would take some beating.,0
Everything that everyone has said here is true. The place is beautiful and the staff are truly wonderful. Our luggage was left behind in Athens and Despina drove to the airport to go and hurry them up with getting it to Santorini. They go above and beyond to make your stay as perfect as possible. Our honeymoon was fantastic and we wish we could be back there! Thanks to everyone at Anastasis,1
"We enjoyed our honeymoon at Anastasis Apartments and ""enjoyed"" is a bit underestimated... We felt like a king and a queen due to the care and all the litlle surprises Anastasis team had for us. We couldn't imagine our honeymoon better than they made us feel at this heavenly place ! We stayed 1week in the honeymoon suite and I can't really think of 1 negative comment... It was superclean, they do really everything to make you feel comfortable and the surprises are gordious, but... you have to find out them for yourself ;)They got all 5 stars from us, if there was a 6th one, they would certainly get it also :)   Room Tip: take one of the suites, you won't regret ! See more room tips",1
"We stayed at anastasis following our wedding in Santorini, and it was 10 days of pure serene bliss. The staff cannot do enough for you and I truly believe the location, although isolated, is the best on the island. It is one of the only places you can stay where you're not overlooked by lots of other hotels, also you don't have to manuver a million steps! And the hotel shuttle you to Fira, imerovigli town and firastefani for free. Further we viewed the sunset from many different points of the island and the best is certainly from the hotel. I could go into every detail but I won't! you need to just book it and experience every little surprise! From the frequent complimentary drinks and snacks, to the nightly turndown surprises.Finally Let the hotel make restaurant bookings for you, you will always have the best seat in the place.",1
Anastasis was truly a memorable experience that we will soon not forget. The service was exceptional. The view of the Caldera from the hotel is amazing. Thank you to Despina and her team for all the nice surprises. Make sure you stop by Tasos Taverna around the corner when you're here. Nice experience all around.,1
"I can only agree with every other review, Anastasis is a truly magical place. The staff; the building; the rooms; the pool; the spa; the view are all 10/10. In all my years of staying in hotels I've never come across a team so willing and helpful to make the experience perfect and they were all really genuinely nice.",1
"We chose this hotel for a special birthday and stayed in the Anastasis villa. This was set into the cliff with the most amazing views and an absolute wow factor.The staff ensured privacy whilst delivering 5* service in an unobtrusive way.I think every thing has been said re the Apartments, just book, its the most perfect place I have ever stayed and you will not be disappointed. The staff truly do make Anastasis special and their level of care is second to none.   Room Tip: They are all wonderful See more room tips",1
"My fiance and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Greece - the highlight being our stay at Anastasis. If you're thinking about staying here - DO IT! The staff, the views, the pool, the food, the surprises...everything was absolutely over-the-top incredible. THANK YOU, Anastasis team, for an unforgettable experience!",2
"My husband and I went to Santorini on our honeymoon. We picked Anastasis because it looked quiet and intimate and we wanted to stay on the Caldera rather than by the sea. I have never been so impressed. Let me explain why, so you are in no doubt that this place is the right choice!1. Location - Best view of the sunset, out of the whole island! My hubby and I watched the sunset from several different parts of the island (beach, Oia, Fira, boat) and the view from Anastasis was by far our favourite from land. The boat was very special too! If you want to be within easy walking distance to everything then this is not the place for you. If you want to be a little out of the way (with free shuttle taxis and easy access to quad bikes etc), where it's quiet, stunning, and has incredible views, then this is the place for you!2. Service - Anastasis has the best staff I have ever come across. From the reception ladies, to the men who do various different jobs, to the cleaners and the cook; everyone is incredible. Kind, friendly, HELPFUL and genuinely nice people. They cannot do enough for you and make the whole experience so special because everyone feels like a VIP! 3. Cleanliness - the rooms are cleaned twice a day, including towel changes. They are immaculate. The resort is spotless, gleaming in fact!4. Rooms - you can choose from a stunning Villa to a junior suite. We had the smallest room in the resort and it was still plenty big enough and you could fit 6 people in our shower! Beds are comfortable, there is a fridge, kettle, coffee maker etc. And the views and service are the same regardless of your room! We honestly cannot rate this place highly enough. We will definitely return, and in fact I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. They made our honeymoon so special in so many ways, from excellent recommendations on restaurants & activities, to the VIP service and special treats that were offered on a couple of nights during our stay. THANK YOU ANASTASIS TEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!   Room Tip: There's no bad room and no bad view! See more room tips",4
"My fiance and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at Anastasis Apartments. From the moment we stepped out of the airport shuttle, to the moment we got back into the return airport shuttle, everything was on point. Despina and the team did everything above and beyond our expectations and made our stay one that we will always remember. We stayed in room 109 which is located on the ground floor facing the pool. The room was white, airy and clean with lots of storage space. The communal hotel grounds (pool area, indoor spa, chill out area) were clean and very well maintained. We opted to have breakfast outside every morning. Fresh orange juice, coffee, bread, cakes, savoury, eggs and a selection of fruit and fresh Greek yoghurt; there was a lot of choice and we definitely were left feeling very full. The hotel provided complimentary afternoon coffees with a surprise dessert served, I looked forward to this daily :) We would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to be treated like royalty. The staff are excellent, and the little daily surprises added a special touch to the overall stay/experience. Efharishto Anastasis Apartments.",2
Just returned from a perfect holiday at Anastasis Apartments. It's true what the other reviewers say. We don't usually holiday in the same place twice but we would go back there. The attention to detail is staggering.,1
Well done Anastasis for getting it right! We were astonished at the level of service the we were given. All the staff from the girls on reception to the maids and the boys who brought us breakfast everyday (and more) were incredible. From the Welcome to the goodbye your attention to detail was second to none every step of the way. Thank you so much.,1
We stayed there for four nights and the experience was simply phenomenal. We can see why it's rated the 4th most romantic hotel in the world. Despina runs an extremely tight ship and its the PERFECT place to stay if you are a couple that is seeking a relaxing holiday with out a thought or a finger to lift. We were treated like royalty and will never forget not only the service(which was 10 stars) but more importantly the Experience.,0
"We have just returned from our honeymoon at Anastasis, and believe me, this was the kind of holiday that dreams are made of. We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate the start of our married life together. We chose Anastasis because of the reviews on Tripadvisor, but were both slightly apprehensive as our expectations were so high, and we didn't want to be disappointed. We needn't have worried. Not only did it meet our expectations but exceeding them over and over. Santorini is a beautiful island in itself, but the Anastasis Apartments are devine - a piece of heaven on earth, pure paradise.From the minute you are greeted at the airport, the experience of pure indulgence begins. Mrs Despina and her team deliver a new level of customer service to their guests, certainly much higher than we have ever experienced before, and you are made to feel like the most important people in the world. The views literally are breathtaking, we had goosebumps the first time we were shown the view from Mrs Despina, and the goosebumps continued all holiday with the absolutely amazing surprises and outstanding service that are constantly delivered by the team. We won't divulge what any of the surprises are, as we don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I was certainly moved to tears on numerous occasions by these special moments, and it is clear that the team genuinely love delivering these surprises to their guests, and get great pleasure from the responses of the recipients. You will never experience anything like it.We stayed in the honeymoon suite for 8 days then moved to a superior apartment for the rest of our stay as the honeymoon suite was not available for the whole time, but both rooms were beautiful.We have travelled to some wonderful places, and had some fantastic holidays, but we will be hard pushed to find anything that can come anywhere close to matching Anastasis. It is such a very special place with an absolutely incredible team, and we cannot thank them enough for making our honeymoon the best ever. I was actually in tears saying goodbye to the team when we left, as they are all so wonderful, and they, along with Anastasis, will hold a special place in our hearts for ever. We will return, but will need to negotiate with Mrs Despina, as we want to return far sooner than she was saying we could!! Thank you Mrs Despina, Katarina, Tonia, Despina, the lovey guys that looked after our every need around the pool, and the lovely ladies that keep the rooms immaculate. You have created the most amazing memories for us and we look forward to seeing you on our return.Jane & Jon",0
"We stayed seven nights at Anastasis. On arrival, the first time you see the view it is breathtaking. After being warmly greeted by Despina, Despina 2.Tonia and Katerina, along with young men bearing cold flannels and chilled water, we were invited to sunset drinks by the pool. When we arrived it was like walking onto the set of ""The Night Manager"" (recent UK TV drama featuring exquisite hotels and scenery). The tables and chairs were decorated beautifully as for a wedding.The following day was our 38th wedding anniversary. We were treated like royalty from start to finish. After breakfast there was a knock on the door an we opened it to find Katerina and one of the young men bearing gifts of a bouquet of flowers and 2 glasses of bubbly.In the evening Despina had booked us a wonderful table in a restaurant called La Maison which had breathtaking views . After our meal the restaurant staff brought a beautiful anniversary cake to our table which had been sent to the restaurant by Despina ,unbeknown to us. When we got back to the hotel there was an even bigger surprise awaiting us which I will not reveal as it would spoil the surprise for anybody else in the future.Enough to say it was the most wonderful anniversary we have ever had!We were floating on Cloud 9!The rest of the week followed as everybody has said before, with lovely breakfasts served on the balcony. drinks and snacks served during the day and a surprise awaiting us every night on our return from our evening meal.The three receptionists were so kind and helpful and genuinely seemed to care about us. Also the four young men who work constantly to keep you supplied with drinks and who cater for every need, were absolutely wonderful.They wont let you lift a finger!Along with the excellent maids they keep the hotel and grounds immaculate.What makes this hotel stand out from any other is the quality of service and the luxury and cleanliness of the accommodation.Many thanks to Despina and her wonderful staff for making our anniversary so special. We will see you again soon I hope.   Room Tip: We had a Junior suite on the first floor which we liked as we were not overlooked. See more room tips",0
"Santorini is a very special and romantic place on Earth. Anastasis Apartments and their staff really exceds the perfection on every level, surpassing far and beyond any kind of expectations about how a honeymoon should be. From the day one, starting with a personalized transfer from the airport to Anastasis at 8h in the morning (check-in at 14h) they receveid us with a very warm and kind atittude and a lot of surprises, like a magnificent breakfast in a reserved area with all the facilities and an astonishing view of Santorini. It’s impossible to describe in words the level of excellence of the service here at Anastasis… the kindness and the attention to the minimum details, with a lot of sweet surprises all day long (drinks, pastry, snacks, fresh water and towels for refreshing, the very cosy and romantic suite including a balcony with a breathtaking view to Oia and the sunset, the large and beautiful pool with a cinematic view over the top of the Caldera, the cleannless of all the areas, room cleaned daily, and the towels changed twice a day, very confortable bed, the evening service at the room, with a fantastic romantic surprise in bed, renewed every day, the beautiful spa and interior pool, the absolutely magnificent breakfast served in the room or at the balcony, the daily free shuttle service by minivan to Fira, all the informations to the activities in Santorini, and a lot of other charming details that has surprised us, day by day. All the staff is amazing, truly incredible… we never seen nothing similar before. Anastasis really provide the ultimate and sublime experience in Santorini. If you asked us if it is a 5 stars hotel and service the answer is no. It’s a five million stars! Really a charming and beautifull paradise inside the paradise of Santorini.A big big 'Efharisto' to Mrs.Despina and all the Anastasis team. We will surely return Ricardo e Marta",1
"We stay at this wonderful & grand apartment for 2 nights for part of our 20th anniversary trip at Greece. Despina & her team are very cheerful & helpful during our stay, try their best to surprise us with well arranged romantic private sunset jacuzzi spa, sweet room decoration every night and private indoor jacuzzi spa, impress us very much & delight our day at Santorini. Katherine is very warm & sweet to give us recommendation & offer help to arrange our activities everyday, she make us feel like a family member, We especially like her gorgeous & charming smile which is always shining us. This is the hotel exceed our expectation with more than excellent services and stunning view . You feel the heart of the hotel team to make you special and sure will choose it again if we visit Santorini next time.",0
"My husband and I got married in Santorini and we chose to spend 6 Glorious nights after our Wedding at Anastasis and I'm so glad we did! We stayed in the Honeymoon suite which was beautiful with a large balcony and Hot Tub!Depina and her teams service is impeccable top 6 star, never stayed anywhere where they literally can not do enough for you! Breakfast is different everyday and delivered to your balcony, around the pool water is served throughout the day, you have a present every night in your room when you return ..I literally cant say enough how wonderful our stay was! The View is absolutely stunning, when we first arrived and walked through the apartments from the reception we were both breath-taken.They run a minibus various times in the day & night down to Fira which is great as you are a little out of it but honestly you won't to leave and you don't have to, they have everything you would ever want or need for a romantic break! Truly magical! Cant wait to book for our first anniversary next year!Thank you Despina to you and your incredible Team Natasha and George",1
"Without Peer in SantoriniAnastasis delivered everything and much more that we could have ever expected.Breathtaking views from all accommodation choices, included breakfasts to give us the energy to explore this island, awesome sunsets with drinks and food which you never tire of and free transfers to Fira and surrounds for recommended dinners with the best seats made it very special.It was, however, the personal customer service from Despina and her staff while being almost unseen, that elevated Anastasis to exceptional. Being met at the back gate with a cold towel and fresh water after a walk to surrounding areas was totally unexpected but a sign of how well managed Anastasis is.Every guest during our stay felt that unique experience and many had returned from previous holidays and passers by frequently asked if we would swap with them.Future options for holidays will always be compared to this and we feel we will have to come back so not to be disappointed in comparison.6 Stars.....Dave & Sue   Room Tip: Honeymoon and Anastasis Suite would be my selections, with the Villa for the privacy.

"It is with heavy heart that we say goodbye to Anastasis Apartments this morning.Often inflated expectations flop in the harsh glare of reality, and Anastasis Apartments come with very high accolades. However, not once - even nearly - did this wonderful accommodation threaten to disappoint. In fact, they exceeded expectations, in bucket loads!We have been fortunate to stay in some excellent accommodations throughout the world, but none can compare to the service standards set at Anastasis Apartments.From the warm welcome, to song birds serenading you at breakfast, to special little gifts at turn-down service, to respectful Greek lessons - the bar is extremely high!We did not get the room we wanted due to the high amount of return reservations, but were very pleased with our poolside room. A variety of pillows to suite any sleeping style and an air-conditioning that ensured the July heat stayed outside, made our stay very comfortable. The mini fridge was well stocked and bathroom amenities plentiful.The grounds, including infinity pool, are immaculate! We adored the spa area done out in gorgeous Cycladic architecture.What sets Anastasis Apartments apart though is the service. Despina and her dedicated team think of absolutely everything to make your Santorini visit very, very special.Attentive and friendly service without being intrusive - the perfect balance; like everything else at Anastasis. The breakfast provided in-room or on the terrace is plentiful, afternoon coffee and desert, and evening drinks with snacks, are finely crafted, and itinerary recommendations spot on.My sincere gratitude to all staff at Anastasis for the incredibly high standards they set. It is heartening to see that high quality is still to be found in our commercialized world.",0
"My wife and myself have Just returned from the Anastasis apartments and cannot even start describe how great this place is. The staff are so friendly and on the ball, they will stop at nothing to provide for your every need, even providing flannels to freshen yourself up when you have been out. They will organise restaurant bookings for you, Generally getting the best tables and then transfer you to and from Fira or wherever you wish to go, and are always on hand to assist you. They make the experience that little more special.The views are stunning, picture perfect. The rooms immaculate, towels replaced twice a day. A breakfast is provided at a prearranged time along with a dinner time smoothie and afternoon tea or coffee.This was the ultimate relaxing vacation and words cannot do it justice, would love to return at some point in the future.",0
The most beautiful resort in the most beautiful place in the world. You will not believe what you are seeing and experiencing. Despina and team do not miss a single detail and then add in many extra touches to make your visit special and unforgettable. I'm writing this from a lounger next to the infinity pool overlooking the caldera. Breathtaking.,1
"What a place! Amazing ! Despina and her team are awesome nothing is too much trouble. My wife is dairy and lactose intolerant no problems here , special treats and snacks made for her each day,on our way out in the evening after special sunsets she was given a hand written message of her dietary requirements and then with our complimentary transfer we were off to the best restaurants , with the best table and views . Won't go into detail of all the hidden special moments that are provided as that would spoil the surprises. The view from the pool has to be seen to be believed.",0
"We have just returned from a most amazing holiday , made special by the owners and staff alike. So many surprises, treats, and personal touches we felt absolutely spoiled. The location is second to none and the sunsets were beautiful. Thank you for such a special holiday!   Room Tip: Every apartment was stunning! See more room tips",0
"Just arrived back home from a week at the anastasis to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary , it was also my husbands birthday whilst we were there. I first saw pictures of the anastasis nearly two years ago and promised myself that one day I'd go there . Last September I took the plunge and booked. I read all the reviews and went with high expectations and was worried that my expectations were too high...I was wrong . My expectations were surpassed ten fold. The service from beginning to end was incredible and I felt like I was part of a family. Nothing was too much trouble and we have been truly pampered. My husband was made to feel like a king and was brought to tears on his birthday ..I just can't belive the trouble that all the staff took to make our stay so special. I feel truly honoured and humble to be lucky enough in life to have stayed at the anastasis. When you arrive you will be personally met by Despina and her fantastic team...and when Despina takes you through that glass door to the pool area ...well just make sure you take a deep breath because to view is stunning . The location is perfect , with Fira being too busy with all hotels stacked on top of one another, oia equally busy , but the anastasis is perfectly placed and so so quite . The evening just sat around the pool, with beautiful chill out music softly playing, wine in hand , watching the most unbelievable sunset will stay with me for a long time . Breakfast are AMAZING ! I could go on and on but no amount of reading reviews and no amount of looking at pictures can even come close to explain how unbelievable this place is , and the amazing service you get . I was so moved by the experience that I shed a tear almost everyday ! We ARE going back !! If Despina and her team book you a restuarant you'll get the best table in the house . One of our fav' places was the tassos tavern. Dimitris in Amoudi bay was good but expensive but I loved it . ( if going down the hundreds of steps you need good shoes with a good grip sole, no flip flops ) . We also did a catermaran trip which was awesome . We loved watching the sunset from our balcony ( anastasis suite) or around the pool as found the atmosphere magical. I don't know what else to say as can't put it into words but ask me questions ....all I can say is don't stay any where else!! All rooms have fab views and the service and little surprises are standard across all room types . The anastasis suite for complete privacy and wow factor   Room Tip: All rooms have stunning views, the Anastasis suite for complete privacy. I would be happy in ANY a... See more room tips",0
"This place is so incredibly worthy of its number 1 spot on trip advisor, something which cannot always be said everywhere in the world.The attention to detail and quality of service are absolutely out of this world, and Despina and her team genuinely care about each and every one of their guests and do anything they can to make your stay perfect.We will be back for sure, as I am sure will lots of our friends and family that we will undoubtedly be recommending this place to.The location for us was perfect. Far enough away from the tourist areas to get some peace, yet close enough to some really high quality restaurants, all only a 5-10 minute shuttle ride away.Thank you again to everybody at Anastasis for giving us the perfect week.   Room Tip: Look at their website - the pictures are spot on. See more room tips",0
"I would like to thank Despina, Despina, Tonia, Katerina, and all the staff for making our stay more I could have ever imagined or wanted. I have never received service or have been treated in a way that Anastasis has treated us since the day we stepped on their residence. It was immaculate from start to finish. They go above and beyond to make sure their guests feel like they are 1000% cared for and have everything they need and want. They make sure you feel you are in paradise. I never thought this was possible as my husband and I were skeptical as to how a place can have amazing reviews, but after a few days with Despina and her wonderful crew, we felt like part of their family and never wanted to leave. We stayed for 1 week and everyday was filled with different surprises, it is a cozy but relaxing atmosphere and oozes romance. I loved EVERYTHING about Anastasis Apartments. Thank you for making this the trip of my dreams.",0
"I would consider myself lucky that we were able to enjoy a 10 day honeymoon at the incredible Anastasis Apartments in 2010. To be able to experience this boutique resort even once in your life is fortunate. In 2015, my husband and I decided to return to Anastasis for another 10 days to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary. I was apprehensive knowing that we could never top the ultimate experience we had there for our honeymoon. My apprehension was misguided. The Anastasis team made our second visit even more special then the first (although I am not sure how that was possible). Their personal touches and attention to detail helped create a visit which was unbelievable. The improvements that they have made to the property and the addition of the spa on the premises take this already 5 star experience so much further. During our return visit it is possible that we appreciated Anastasis much more being that we were now the parents of a 3 year old and this was our first real couples getaway since he was born... or the honeymoon nostalgia of our first visit rejuvenated us. Either way, Anastasis will always hold a very special place in our hearts and souls. We can not recommend this fantastic boutique hotel enough and we hope to return for a third time to this incredible paradise.",0
"Outstanding hotel and wonderful team of staff. A truly special place to enjoy the wonders of Santorini. Location is perfect; it offers a quiet retreat away from crowds while still being accessible to Oia and Fira. Some specific points: 1. Professional, caring and friendly members of staff who were always willing to help.2. Amazing 'surprises' at different points in the stay which added to the outstanding feel.3. Immaculate levels of cleanliness throughout the hotel complex. Very comfortable and well equipped rooms.4. Wonderful location to enjoy sunsets in a quiet and peaceful way.5. Excellent services offered such as local transfers to Fira. Overall a fanatic and memorable stay!",0
Probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at for service. The staff are simply outstanding. The location is perfect and away from the madding crowds. Walking along the caldera is such a pleasure. Very close to amenities - restaurants\ shops etc. You don't need a car unless you want to travel around the island a bit.   Room Tip: All rooms seem to be to the same lovely standard - but I imagine the suites will be much larger See more room tips,0
"From the moment we were greeted by the gorgeous owner and her wonderful staff we just new we were in for one of the most amazing weeks ever . This place is perfect in every way with absolutely stunning views . We stayed in the white room which was fantastic with a hot tub so we could sit in it with our evening sun set drinks . We were looked after throughout the week superbly and didn't want for anything everyday was special and started off by our breakfast being served outdoor on our balcony every breakfast was different and we looked forward to lifting the lid off our plate to see what we had . Afternoon drinks were wonderful again with little extra surprise nibbles . Thoroughly cleaned rooms daily with bath robes and towels , tea and coffee and fridge restocked daily . We had our anniversary here and were thoroughly spoilt on the day with surprise use of spa and steam room which was lit with hundreds of candles a card and champagne plus a beautiful bouquet of flowers . The staff here are excellent each and everyone one of them went that extra mile to make our stay perfect , from the minute you walk back in to the hotel we were greeted with refreshments and freshening cold towels , courtesy transport every evening to wherever we needed to go . We will most definitely be back here in the future and had tears in my eyes to leave everybody I hope my review details how wonderful our stay was . Thanks everyone for the best week ever .",0
"We've just returned from this hotel having also stayed last year and it just gets better. The level of service is out of this world, the staff really can't do enough for you. We have stayed in 2 different rooms both of which were amazing, it really comes down to personal preference as to which one you go for, unlike some websites the pictures are totally accurate. We are already planning our return in 2018",1
"My husband and I stayed here from May 25 to June 1. I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have said but will say we received the best service I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. Don't consider staying anywhere else in Santorini. To Despina, Despina, Katerina, Tonia and all the boys, thank you so much for everything you did for us. We cannot wait to see you all again!!!!!",0
"Wow! It might be hard to believe all of the amazing things said about this place in earlier reviews, but they are all true! My wife and I had high expectations about staying here based on what we've read, but to say they exceeded our expectations would be an understatement. For us, two things really separate Anastasis from any place we've ever stayed. The first is Despina's staff. When we arrived we were told they treat their guests like family, which we weren't quite sure what this meant at the time, but after about the first hour it became clear. They go above and beyond to ensure that you have no worries while you're their guest. They literally take care of EVERYTHING for you, from restaurant reservations, tour bookings, to driving into town to pick something up if you need it. Their only goal is for you to have the best time possible. The second thing that stood out was their location. We were a little nervous not being located in Fira or Oia, as those are the two places you hear about in Santorini. We found Imerovigli to be perfect for us. Located just off the Fira/Oia trail, we felt far away from all of the tourists that crowd the towns when the cruise ships arrive. That being said, the hotel offers a shuttle service throughout the day to Fira and is happy to call a cab to get you to Oia. The views from the hotel were absolutely perfect. We were able to enjoy the sunsets by the pool or on our balcony with their homemade Ouzo!Thanks Despina and the Anastasis team! We will definitely be back!   Room Tip: If you want a private hot tub, stay in one of the suites. They're worth it! See more room tips",1
"This was my second visit to Anastasis Apartments and it was even better than I remembered! The view of the caldera is breathtaking and the service is perfection! Despina and her entire staff could not do more to make a holiday special. If there is a gold medal for excellence, Anastasis is the clear winner! I can only dream of my next vacation at this island jewel!",2
"We stayed in the White Suite for a week in May 2016, having stayed in the same hotel in 2009. We received a very warm return welcome, and we had another unforgettable stay. The room was beautiful, the views breathtaking, and Imerovigli now has a wide range of lovely places to go, although our favourite was the family run Tasos Taverna just a few minutes walk away. But what stands out here beyond anywhere else we have stayed, other than the wonderful peace (so rare to find), was the way you are looked after. The breakfasts were first class, the turndown service was magical, there were little treats through the day, and nothing at all is too much trouble, including transfers to the village and even into Fira. Despina, her husband, and her wonderful team work so very hard to anticipate your every need and to make your holiday completely perfect. A couple of examples of how the service is beyond compare; It started to rain as we were having dinner in the nearby tavern. Despina's husband popped in with a couple of umbrellas for our walk home! Then, we had a second week in nearby Pyrgos, but we wanted to come back to Tasos for our last night, and the Pyrgos hotel's transfer was expensive. We cheekily called Anastasis, as they knew a better taxi company, and they arranged the whole thing for us. When we tried to pay the driver, we found that they had covered the cost! We weren't even staying there that week! This was such an act of kindness that we felt quite tearful, especially when the family from Tasos Taverna drove us back to Pyrgos later that night. I would recommend Anastasis without a single hesitation, and we cannot wait to return.",0
"What can one add that hasn't been said over and over. Just back from a four day stay. This is our 3rd visit,we were here in 2008 and 2013. If it is possible this place only gets better. As I said before don,t waste your time looking at other places book here but book early. Waking up to the view over the caldera is one of life's greatest pleasures. Dreaming of my next visit.   Room Tip: Book early all rooms have fabulous views. See more room tips",0
"I rarely write reviews. Even more so, I don't write reviews while still staying at the hotel. That said, Anastasis Apartments is the gem amongst all gems. This place is special. From the moment you arrive, Despina (pronounced Vespina in Greek) and her entire team treat you like royalty. My wife and I are staying in the Villa for our honeymoon and we are convinced this is the best hotel room on the island. If you stay at Anastasis you will avoid the hustle and bustle of being in Oia and Fira. It's fantastic being in Imerovigli (even though the location of the hotel is outside of the main village). The most noise we hear all day laying on our terrace is from time to time the walkers on the path above.If you want a true five-star experience then I recommend you stay at Anastasis Apartments. We cannot share with you the ""secrets"" they have at Anastasis, but I can say that I could not imagine a better place to have stayed on our honeymoon. And we still have a few days left here!A few tips:1) Don't ask for recommendations ahead of time for restaurants, activities, etc. They will take care of it for you once you arrive. And everything they have recommended has been amazing.2) The restaurant has a free shuttle service to take you to and from dinner. This is fantastic. Everybody raves about it. And they are always on time.3) Stay in the Villa. It's immense privacy and ultimate luxury. It's a stunning room.4) Watch the sunset from the hotel. Many people will tell you to go into Oia to watch the sunset, and maybe it is beautiful, but you get the best, most non-hassled view from the hotel.I can't say enough about Anastasis Apartments. I walk around Santorini and see there are some ""tacky"" accommodations, but that is not the case here. This is one special place.",1
What a truly amazing experience! Despina and all the people at Anastasis Apartments go above and beyond in service and hospitality. The view is gorgeous of course. The friendly and professional staff and service is what makes this place stand out among the best places in the world. An indoor jacuzzi bath and an outdoor jacuzzi hottub were very nice. Breakfasts and thoughtful touches were outstanding! We have to return again one day!

"The staff were all very friendly and helpful, facilities and cleanliness without fault .We would welcome another holiday in these apartments .We only had a short walk to the promenade and beach ,where there were many bars and restaurants to choose from,the staff were all friendly and made us feel welcome.",0
"When my husband and I decided to go to Santorini for our honeymoon we started looking on tripadvisor to find the perfect hotel. We came across Anastasis and decided to book as the reviews were amazing. Now after our stay I have to say that the reviews do not do it justice!! It is almost impossible to describe how great the hotel, location, staff and the service are unless you actually go there!! The room we stayed in was spacious, clean and with it's own character which really captured the mood of being on a honeymoon. But the team more than anything really went out of their way to make us feel welcome, relaxed and more importantly, on a romantic honeymoon. Each night we received a surprise from the team which, without giving anything away, was not expected but made the experience all the greater. We really want to thank Despina and the team for giving us a perfect honeymoon that we will always treasure and remember. And hopefully we will return in the future.",0
"Had high expectations of service levels after reading other reviews but they were surpassed with Despina and team clearly taking great pride in providing a memorable stay for their guests. Numerous examples of this including the nightly treats on turn-down service; procuring excellent tables for dinner reservations (and shuttling us back and forth); not allowing guests by pool to lift a finger etc. etc. We subsequently stayed at 5 star Canava Suites in Oia and, although Anastasis doesn’t quite match the room quality (still v nice), the service is on different level at fraction of price. Fully recommend!!",0
"My husband and I spent 3 days at this magical place and it was not enough! From the moment we set eyes on the view (and we arrived on a rare cloudy day) we were already convinced this would be far from our last trip to Santorini. We had many plans to go exploring but found it hard to tear ourselves away from the serene view by the pool. We did head to Oia for the famous sunset one evening but found we enjoyed the sunsets much more back at the hotel away from the crowds and with a glass of wine in hand! Despina and her whole team go way above and beyond to make your stay very special with little surprises, warm and personal interactions, and great recommendations for restaurants. You know how when you ask for recommendations a lot of hotels usually give you some average choices nearby or places they have a relationship with? You can be sure that's not the case here, they were so honest about places we had in mind, came up with some fantastic plans, and took care of making reservations and arranging transportation. We were treated so well at every place they booked for us. Everyone in the reviews raves about the staff but you really have to experience it to see just what a difference it makes. I really can't imagine a better place to stay!",3
"We booked to stay at Anastasis based on trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. The room was spacious, exceptionally clean with comfortable bed and nice linen but the best part is the customer service and the surprises. The staff were all exceptional and helped to make our stay a lovely experience. The breakfast was substantial with a daily variation. There is so much I could continue to say that was wonderful about our stay but it has all been said before. We have never experienced such a high level of customer service at any other hotel we have stayed in. We have already recommended Anastasis to our friends and we intend to return again.   Room Tip: All rooms have fabulous views of the Caldera. See more room tips",0
"Anastasis was amazing - location, view, cleanliness, rooms, facilities, but most of all outstanding service and friendliness. With only 10 rooms there is plenty of space for solitude, plenty of attention when wanted. No stone left unturned, no request to much, and lots of little extras and surprises....but saying any more will spoil it. Despina and the team made us feel real special. We had a superior apartment which was plenty big enough and enjoyed being pool level so we could nip in and out to swim, sunbathe and walk easily. Highly recommended indeed, it's the only place we would consider going again when we go back to Santorini one day.",1
"This place is heaven on earth, staff, room, service is second to none. Our very favourite place to stay. This is our second time here and more glorious than before. Beautiful view each and every day and the walk to Oia was lovely with the wild flowers, little lizards scurrying everywhere. Upon our return we were greeted with icy cold water and refreshing towel, how delightful. Such a memorable experience and one we will always treasure. Hopefully we will return again one day.   Room Tip: All are beautiful See more room tips",0
"What can be added to the long list of superlatives already used? Simply that they are all true!  The quality of the staff is matchless while the cleanliness, food & service are superb. Everyone who works here seems to be genuinely pleased to meet their guests and much of this is, no doubt, due to the sterling management of Despina. Her assistants, like the ever-smiling Katerina, want so much for your visit to be enjoyable that they can't seem to do enough to help you enjoy Santorini. The many "" surprises "" that are arranged are very sweet and, with the incredible sunsets and exquisite food, contribute to a First Class experience. For a pampered interlude at a quiet, well-run, friendly hotel, you can find none better. We WILL be returning!",0
"The TripAdvisor reviews had set our expectations ridiculously high, yet the Anastasis team managed to surpass them in every way. They arranged an airport transfer for us, and had a welcome drink prepared for us shortly after arrival. We spent four nights of our honeymoon in the White Suite (room 101) at this beautiful property. We had all our drinks and breakfasts served to us on our private balcony overlooking the caldera. The sunset views from the property are better than the sunsets in Oia. The property is right on the trail you can take to walk to Fira or Oia. Whenever you do go out for a walk, someone will be there to deliver a cold towel and ice water to you upon your return. The entire team genuinely cares if you are enjoying yourself. They helped us make dinner reservations, recommended activities and tours and even taught us a little Greek. Our room was beautiful, and the views even better. The ""light"" breakfast they offer each morning kept us full half the day. The fresh yogurt was a highlight, as were the little notes from the staff. The evening surprises we read so much about were so much more surprising and better than we ever could have imagined. We did not want to leave. We hugged Despina goodbye and promised we would be back for our ten year anniversary.",0
"This was our third time at Anastasis. Each visit has been unbelievable but this time was over the top! We have stayed at places like the Ritz in San Francisco that has wonderful service, but Anastasis is in a class of its own. From the welcome drinks and appetizers on our private deck to the huge, delicious breakfasts in our own suite, and everything in between, Anastasis spoiled us from beginning to end. Our love and thanks to Despina and her staff (especially Despina #2, Tonia, and Katarina)! We miss you already and hope we will be lucky enough to return again soon.

My boyfriend and I chose to celebrate our five year anniversary at Anastasis Apartments. From the complimentary room upgrade to the little surprises at the end of each day of our stay - our stay at Anastasis was beyond perfect! The service at the hotel provided by all the staff is exceptional. We decided to go with the flow and not organise anything before the holiday - which was not a problem as the staff were very keen and knowledgeable in explaining exactly where to go and what to do/see depending on what we fancied. The hotel grounds and rooms are well maintained and clean. The location of the hotel is great as it is between Fira and Oia (both of which can be accessed by foot during the day). The sunset views are also amazing! The best way to get around the island is by renting an ATV or car. The receptionists helped us do this and ensured we got a good price too! There are too many good things to write about Anastasis - the 5* reviews do not lie!,1
"Amazing service, amazing views. You will not find another place like this one. Santorini's views and this establishment go hand by hand. The staff had wonderful surprises every night waiting in our room. Went for my honeymoon and took my honeymoon to a whole different level. I will be back without question.",2
"Most amazing views, great pool, and the entire staff is fantastic. Stayed here for our honeymoon a few years ago, and felt bad that I never wrote a review. August is scorching, but so glad we went. Rented a 'jeep' so we could visit the different beaches and sights. Also liked the local restaurant that's very short walk to the property. And be sure to sign up for the hot tub early - the second sunset hour is the better option - with complimentary Champagne!",5
"Everything were amazing! A super luxury family own hotel with perfect services. We stayed here 4 nights at Anastasis suite and it was amazing; privacy, the views, the big terrace with jacuzzi, suprises..We loved to eat at Taverna Tasos, just 2minute walk down the roadWe will remember forever our stay at Anastasis Apartment! And will be back someday!   Room Tip: If you want privacy; Anastasis suite See more room tips",3
"One of the most memorable places we stayed in Greece. Reviewing a little late, our Honeymoon was in April but had to be done! These people are amazing and take the word hospitality to a whole other level. Dreaming of the day we return. If you don't stay here you are crazy! Don't forget to eat at the Taverna down the road. ""To Steki Tou Nikou"" you will not be disappointed!   Room Tip: White Suite See more room tips",4
"The reviews are right! This is by far the best hotel we have EVER stayed at. Despina and her team made every effort to provide us with a magical honeymoon! A team of wonder woman I tell you! We received a free room upgrade when we arrived, and during the course of our stay received a special treat every night. Just writing about makes me want to go back! All the hype is true, just do it, it is on the expensive side, but when you take into account all the added extras, its completely worth it!",4
"I'm only repeating what other reviewers have said below, but Anastasis was the most amazing place we've ever stayed. Not only was the property gorgeous, the room beautiful and the views stellar, the staff was the best we've ever encountered at a hotel. I don't think a smile left our faces from the moment we were greeted by Despina and her staff until we had to leave 4 days later. We stayed in the White Suite which I can't recommend enough. Privacy, views, it has it all! Although it looked like every room here would be just as beautiful. Thank you Anastasis Team for everything!",4
It's beyond all I can say ! You need to stay to understand. We stayed in honeymoon suite for 5 nights and was the best experience ever. Fully relaxed. From the helpful advices we received from the lovley staff until the beautifull surprises everything make you fell in paradise.,6
"Like many people have already commented, this hotel totally lives up the hype ............. and then some! We had high expectations from reading all of the reviews and I was a bit worried we might be disappointed but how wrong I was. This is without a doubt, the best hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world - it was everything we wanted from a honeymoon plus a whole lot more.Despina and her lovely lovely staff are just fantastic. I have never stayed anywhere where the staff are so attentive to guests needs and go that extra mile to make guests feel truly special. We stayed in the Anastasis Villa - a perfect location for privacy and to get away from it all (we needed it after planning a wedding!). The view from the large terrace area over the caldera was simply stunning - there can be no better view in the world to wake up to! The sunset view was amazing as were the (free!) sunset drinks served on the terrace every night.The staff really went the extra mile for us with their ""little surprises"" one of which genuinely bought tears to my eyes with its thoughtfulness (........I'm not going to give away any of these surprises here by describing them in more detail as I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone else!).There is no doubt that we will be back!   Room Tip: If you want privacy, the Anastasis Villa is perfect See more room tips",4
"I'm not sure I can add anything to the already glowing reviews here, but it really is fantastic. I've stayed in lots of great places over the years but this is truly the best service I have ever received. Great location, stunning views and the whole team cannot do enough to help. They were getting ready to close for the season as we were leaving and I joked that I was going to hide away in a cupboard so I didn't have to leave. Joking aside, I think I have left a little piece of my heart here on the Caldera. I only hope that I can return sometime soon to collect it.",1
"This is an amazingly beautiful small boutique hotel, 11 rooms.From our first greeting the staff was warm and gracious , they took us on a ""tour"" , didnt miss a detail from what are your favorite things for breakfast to what type of cocktail you prefer at sunset....My husband and I joked that they put a tracking device on us at arrival as they seemed to know what we wanted before we did!The suite was perfect , spa is beautiful, the views are gorgeous and there is no way to improve the staff!Katerina, Alex and Despina could give lessons at the Four seasons !Details are everywhere, they anticipate without being intrusive.I dont know how they could have made our stay better , we would go to Greece again just to stay with them :)This is a very special place.",1
"Like others, we had read the reviews, but could not fully appreciate how true they were until we arrived. From the first to the last minute, we felt pampered and valued, yet left in private as well - how Despina and her staff achieve this amazing balance is testimony to her attention to detail. We stayed in the Villa but everywhere looked amazing, and already our friends have booked to go next year - I am sure that we will also return. We will not divulge the nature of the surprises, as that would spoil it for future guests, but rest assured you will not be disappointed!Thank you, thank you, thank you Despina and team for allowing us to totally relax and recharge batteries - you are amazing!!",0
"It has all been said before. We are fortunate to have stayed in many of the best hotels in the world but, without exception, they could learn a lot about service from Despina and her wonderful team. We both remarked that it was like staying in your own private villa, but with an amazing team of butlers and nannies. They look after your every need. Anastasis is slightly away from everything, which is a good thing because Fira and Oia become very busy with cruise ship passengers. The Anastasis team fully understand their location and organise a wonderful free shuttle service to Fira each evening. The local bus service is also very good.The Spa is beautiful but we only used it for manicures. The views are stunning and complimentary drinks are offered every evening for the amazing sunset.We had a Junior Suite but I would recommend taking a bigger suite because there was only room for one sun lounger on our balcony. That is my only tiny quibble with an otherwise exemplary place. We will definitely return and Santorini, in my opinion, is the most beautiful place in Europe.",0
"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon last month. This hotel is so incredible and much more then then positive reviews you read. It is all about the little things that matter. From the moment you step into the hotel, you are treated like royalty. All Despina and her incredible team expect you to do is relax and enjoy. The views, the food, the rooms, the facilities are simply the best, but you will find the standout is the staff. A special thank you to Katerina whose friendliness and kindness really brought sunshine to our stay. This hotel is as good as everyone says if not better. Thank you to everyone there for making our honeymoon so special. This hotel is so special, we hope to come back for our wedding anniversaries in the future!   Room Tip: We stayed in the White Suite and it was incredible. See more room tips",2
I mean everyone says it but it's still true. The service here is impeccable and the place is just stunning. All the staff are so welcoming and plan your days with you making it all so easy. A friend had gone to santorini a few weeks before and told me to make sure to hire a quad bike from close to the hotel so that it wouldn't be a trek to return. No need! Anastasis made them bring it right to me and pick it up back from the hotel. Despina and the team are lovely. Even tho we arrived so late they were still all there to greet us and give us our first of nightly surprises ;)Will definitely be back,0
"like most people i tend to review places i like (or occasionally hate), so often post positive comments. Scrolling through my previous entries you will see that i don't usually allow the holiday rose-colored glasses to permit me to gush and exaggerate. Furthermore I was somewhat sceptical about the many (most?) previous posts about this hotel… how can it be that good ??So here's my answer - it can, and it was, and it far exceeded my already high expectations. From our free upgrade on arrival, through to the staff literally running to bring us cold towels on return from a walk, to the daily mid-afternoon and also pre-sunset drinks, to 3 staff members walking us to the roadside and waving goodbye until the taxi disappeared around the corner, the service was consistently above and beyond exceptional. The hotel is located a 10-15 min walk down the hill from Imeroviglia and has a secluded feel. However we didn't feel isolated as the staff have regular shuttles to all the main towns, and provided us great activity and restaurant suggestions (a day sailing was a particular standout, as was walking the trail to Oia). The pool and views and rooms (we had the upstairs 1 bedroom suite) are all exceptional. Views are great all along the caldera, and it's just personal taste whether you like the views around fira, oia or here more. I personally liked the imeroviglia views the most (highest point on caldera with great sunsets and nice views of volcano and oia). The hotel breakfasts were also fantastic and different every day - we had outs each day on our balcony enjoying the amazing views. We didn't use the spa and hammam facility much but it looked pretty nice.It is however NOT a place for families or kids - it's full of honeymooners, and couples on second honeymoons…. wifi is slowish but functional and as Despina will likely remind you - this is not the time to be working... We will definitely return to Santorini (our new favourite holiday destination!) and will recommend both the island and this hotel highly to others.",1
This hotel is simply amazing! The reviews precious to mine say it all. I had high expectations having read a lot of them and can say they have been met. The team could not be more helpful. They have an uncanny way of knowing exactly what you need and when. Always there but at the same time you feel like you are left alone. The rooms are great. The suite was lovely and if you want a more private stay I would recommend at least one night in the villa. The Jacuzzis in the apartments were fabulous. Able to relax and feel pampered all at the same time. The spa area is also fab. They arranged us to have it for 2 hours to ourselves which was so amazing. They had little suprises for us at every turn which made the holiday extra special. Would return in a heart beat.,1
Myself and my wife visited Anastasis Apartments four months ago and we had an amazing stay. Everything you read about previous reviews is all true.Walking out by the pool for the first time is a moment i will not forget. Despina and her crew couldn't of done any more for us (Alex was especially thoughtful and caring)The only thing i would suggest that you change is the Aircon in the rooms which was noisy.RegardsLeon O'NeillIreland   Room Tip: All rooms seemed to be fantasic. But we were in the junior suite which had an amazing view. See more room tips,0
"A beautiful hotel where they completely look after you. From the moment we arrived and we warmly greeted by 5 people, we have been pampered and nothing has been too much trouble. Surprises wait for you at every turn and they are warm and friendly. Being central on the island but not actually in a town, the staff will book you at any restaurant and drive you and collect you. Like other reviewers have said, somehow you arrive at a full restaurant and the best table is waiting for you after they make your reservation. If you are a first time or nervous traveler this hotel is essential as you have nothing to worry about and you will be well looked after. I do wish however that we spent one night in a hotel in Oia for the experience of being surrounded by little white hotels but so happy we didn't book our holiday there as the tiny streets are crowded and we are even here in the low season. Santorini is one of the most beautiful places we have ever visited and how nice that this hotel treats us like family with their warmth and kindness yet also spoil us rotten! Thank you!",1
My husband and I stayed at Anastasis apartments for 5 days at the end of September to celebrate his 50th birthday. Having viewed all the reviews on trip advisor we had high expectations and we were not disappointed. This amazing hotel really does deserve every accolade that is afforded it. From the minute we arrived to the minute we were left we experienced customer service and a personal service of the upmost quality. The attention to detail is second to none and your every need is catered for and more. Despina and her team work so hard to provide you with a unique experience that makes you feel very special and they should all be commended for the service they provide. Our short stay here was absolutely perfect and our only regret was that we had to leave this stunning little haven. If you are thinking of booking here - do it - you will not regret it! We feel everyone should have the pleasure of staying at Anastasis at least once in their lifetime! To sum up - a huge thank you to Despina and her team for making all our dreams come true. We will be back!   Room Tip: All the rooms have a stunning outlook overlooking the caldera See more room tips,0
"It's difficult to describe how incredibly perfect our stay was at Anastasis Apartments was without citing many of the same things as other reviewers here. So suffice it to say that if you are considering staying here, DO IT. Do it simply based on all of these glowing reviews. I did and I had the best trip (wedding & honeymoon) of my life. The Anastasis team was there every step of the way planning and executing my gorgeous wedding on site while we stayed with them in the Villa for two weeks. Everything that everyone else has said is true; they take care of you in every way that you can think of and so many ways that go above and beyond even the most excellent service I've ever experienced in my life.The Anastasis team is truly world class and after our stay, I consider each and every one of them a friend. Thank you all for such an amazing stay. We will be back as soon as possible!!   Room Tip: Anastasis Villa: for ultimate privacy, luxury and view See more room tips",1
"I usually go into detail about hotels, BUT for this I will not, because there is no need to and plus I'd like you to be surprised as much as my newly married wife and I were. It is HANDS down the BEST service I have received ANYWHERE in my entire life. From when you arrive until you leave everything is perfection. GO, GO, GO a 100X GOOOO. I was on my honeymoon and they went above on beyond. Oh yea the views are spectacular. Nothing impending your view at all.   Room Tip: We had the honeymoon suite on the second floor and it was beautiful and quite. Oh and that view too. See more room tips",3
"My wife and I have stayed in hotels throughout Europe, the US, and the Caribbean, many priced higher than Anastasis, but none has ever come close to the quality, location, and personal service of Anastasis. We were in the Anastasis Suite (if one of the suites is in your budget, DO IT!!!), but our last night we had to move to the lowest price room (prior hotel commitment), and that room was also delightful. All rooms have a view over the Aegean caldera, and they live up to the Santorini reputation of the best sunsets in the world. All rooms also overlook their beautiful infinity pool, where there are always more very comfortable beach chairs than needed. The amenities are the same irrespective of which price room you book. Complimentary breakfast is a multi-course affair, different each day, and can be served either on you porch/balcony, or in your room--you'll never have a breakfast like this in any hotel!! Around 1PM you can have tea or coffee with a pastry served around the pool. Around sunset you can have wine and a snack served at your choice of locations. All this is complimentary also. Anastasis is located a 10 minute walk from the bus stop, and they also offer complimentary shuttle service to Fira. Notwithstanding all the aforementioned amenities, the best thing about Anastasis is the service. Manager Despina Damigou has assembled a wonderful staff who are sensitive to the needs of each guest. Coming back from a walk or tour you are met with an ice-cold towel and a cold drink within seconds of returning. The staff go out of their way to make any arrangements or reservations the guest desires, and they are quick to make recommendations as well. My wife and I consider this our dream hotel, and wish everyone could experience it as we have.   Room Tip: All rooms are superb---book as nice a room as in your budget See more room tips",2
A very pleasant experience. The hotel is in all respects outstanding. The staff and the service ranks as the best we have experienced. The food is absolutely deleious and served in a very beautiful way - and always with a smile and nice remark. The housekeeping is spotless.The view from the appartmet is probably one of the best views one can get.   Room Tip: All rooms are perfect and facing the bay See more room tips,1
"We celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary here in September 2015. Despina, Vangelis and their staff made our stay unforgettable. I have never experienced better service at any hotel, in every department from the wonderful ladies on reception to the waiter/pool attendants/chauffeur and housekeeping staff. It is clear that everyone at Anastasis is committed to service of the utmost quality. Nothing is too much trouble and the whole operation is unbelievably slick. The only problem with staying here is that any vacation hereafter is likely to be second best by a long way ! We agree with every review and one week was not enough. Thank you so very much to Despina and her fantastic team.   Room Tip: All rooms are lovely but the suites have a private balcony with Jacuzzi. See more room tips",0
"Almost all has been said before. I say almost because due to an unfortunate experience I'm able to add another shade to these reviews.Hubby and I stayed at Anastasis Apartments for 4 nights about 2 weeks ago. I won't get into the beautiful grounds, excellent service and incredible treats that other reviewers have mentioned before. Suffice it to say, it's all true. Unfortunately for me, I somehow managed to get the stomach flu for the first time in my adult life half-way through our stay in Santorini. As horrible and horrifying an experience as that was, I can look back now fully recovered and contemplate the exceptional care that we were given by owners and staff alike during that time.First of all, Despina and her husband drove us to the hospital in the middle of the night (after calling ahead for us and explaining the situation). They stayed with us until the doctor was able to see me and only at our insistence did they leave to return home. Even so, they instructed the hospital without our knowledge to notify them when we were done so that someone could pick us up. The driver came and took us to an overnight pharmacy before driving us back to the hotel.Back at the hotel, I was unable to venture too far from the room. This would have proven challenging on our last day since our flight wasn't scheduled until 11pm and we had to check out at 11:30am. No need to worry, it was taken care of. We were provided with a different room where I could rest until we were ready to leave for the airport at 9pm. in the meantime, I was provided with tea, rice, toast and everything I needed to be as comfortable as one can be in that situation. My hubby was also cared for and was still provided their customary treats, even though our stay was officially over.Both Ian and I are extremely grateful to the entire Anastasis team for the kindness and graciousness they showed to us. I'm not one to write reviews but I thought it would be extremely rude on my part not to use this forum to once again thank Despina, her family and her staff for all they did for us during our stay. I have already recommended this hotel to many personally and I unhesitatingly urge anyone considering it to pull the trigger. ps. As a comment on the cost, we found it to be extremely reasonable given all that is provided. High value for money.",5
"Stayed in the lovely white junior suite on an upper level with balcony. Outstanding view of the caldera and the sea. Beautiful breakfasts served with china and crystal, white linens and silver on the balcony each morning. Complimentary afternoon drinks and snacks and sunset drinks and appetizers on the balcony or by the pool, also beautifully served, and delightfully interesting. Returning to this oasis of calm from a hot walk you would be met with a tray of cold water and a cold, refreshing cloth. Upon arriving at the pool, glasses of cold water would instantly appear and you would be asked if you would like the sun umbrella put up. Comfortable lounge chairs and towels were always available facing out to the breathtaking Aegean sea and caldera. Outdoor areas are nicely landscaped and indoor areas beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean, and the Anastasis staff is outstanding. They seem to recognize what you need before you do. Special tables at restaurants, shuttle service to and from the restaurants, advice on attractions. Warm welcomes as you come and go, special little surprises. I wish all the special people in my life could experience Anastasis. Highly recommended as the place to stay in Santorini.   Room Tip: stayed in the junior suite on the upper level - loved it See more room tips",2
"So much has already been written that it is impossible to find more words to describe how truly wonderful the apartments, the location and the staff really are. We are well travelled and have stayed in a lot of hotels but this is the best of them all. We were made to feel like we were the only people there - a piece of magic that is surely unique. The best that we can say is that we are already planning our return. Can't wait to see you again Despina et al!   Room Tip: Book very early to avoid disappointment! See more room tips",2
"We visited Santorini for the 3rd time in 4 years. But we have to say with this trip every place we have ever stayed worldwide could take a lesson from Despina and the 2015 Anastasis team in customer service. Without a doubt as we began our 12 night stay we were blown away from minute one until the final moment we were sadly shuttled back to the airport. Despina and your team have made us us feel like we were in for a treat by choosing your property. From the time you met us on arrival to inform us your staff would be there to make every minute of our stay most memorable and yet said you will barely see us at all. It is so true...it felt as if we thought or dreamt about something your staff would appear out of no where like the perfect mind readers and do something extraordinary without even being asked. It shows in the happiness of your team that if the guests are happy then they are happy as well. They all seem to have a special place in their hearts for every person they meet with the level of dedication they have even after long hours, they just seem so delighted when the guests meet them. This truly is remarkable and you won't believe it until you go. Thank you for the special treatments every day and evening as they were so thoughtful. The service was at the best level we have ever experienced. Within 3 days of our stay we were already reaching out to rebook for next year. We cannot wait to share or vacation with the Anastasis team for 2016. Thank you all for making our stay so perfect! Joe and Naysan   Room Tip: Every room looks perfect no matter your budget See more room tips",0
I can't add much to the other reviews for this wonderful place. We spent a week here for our honeymoon and it was without a doubt the best holiday we've ever had or probably ever will again (until we return!).If you are considering this hotel then please book it now - you will not be disappointed. The whole experience from the minute you step foot on the island till the moment you leave is 5*. We would recommend the couples massage in the exceptional spa for an extra special treat.We can't wait to come back :),0
"We had a wonderful six night stay in Santorini in early August. We are a family of five and stayed in the Sapphire Villa. The pool, hot tub and villa accommodations were perfect and the view is the best we've ever had on a vacation stay. The sunsets are some of the world's most beautiful and experiencing them as a family from the villa has created memories of a lifetime for our family.Most importantly, Niko and his staff were fabulous hosts...starting even before our arrival and continuing throughout our stay. Niko made the pre-arrival planning easy by advising that he would help us sort out our plans upon arrival as it was best to plan around the weather (e.g., best winds for sunset sail). Our package included a welcome gift of fruit and wine with Niko joining to provide an excellent summary of local history. Throughout our six day stay, Niko and the staff provided great service and advice. The Greek breakfast served on our terrace was particularly enjoyable. Moreover, every bit of advice on activities and dining that Niko provided was absolutely spot on...it was like having a trusted friend on the island.Simply put, Niko and the staff were the best hosts we have experienced on our extensive travels. I completely recommend Celestia Grand Villas and hope to return soon.",0
"We celebrated our honeymoon at the celestia grand and had the most amazing 3 nights ever, the view is breathtaking and villa outstanding, it is the most beautiful place I have ever visited. The sunset is outta this world! Niko was superb and couldn't do enough for us. We hope one day to return. Anyone considering this place should defiantly go!Mr & Mrs Cope",0
"I waited 2 months before writing this review to be as objective as i can.But i can assure you once you visit the Celestia Grand, no other hotel or destination will ever give you the same satisfaction. I am sure you have read the previous reviews so there is no need to dwell much on that. Sufficing to say that all of them are true but you have to see it to believe it. I went with my wife for our wedding anniversary and it was a better experience than our honeymoon in Italy. Once you are there, just let Niko the fabulous draw your trip itinerary (where to go what to see, what to eat, ...) he is just amazing -go for the greek breakfast every day. It is one of the best i have ever had-try the greek buffet dinner just next door (forgot the name of the hotel but it is a sister hotel of Celestia and the waiters are crazy and amazing)- go for a romantic dinner or sunset drinks in the Petit Palace also a sister hotel of Celestia (you will never regret it)-rent an ATV or buggy you can tour the whole island and it is an amazing experience -Niko will guide you to a nearby winery. Go there. It has amazing tasting packages and you can buy all your souvenirs and greek foods from there (olives, oils, soaps, ...) at a better price than fira-niko will also recommend a full day catamaran trip. You have to do it if you have time. One of the best experiences in my life and i am a seasick guy I am not sure what to say but our experience was perfect and we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite despite the busy season. This will be our yearly ritual for sure; well if we can afford to",1
"Over our family's week long stay in Santorini, we stayed in two of the Celestia Grand villas. The villas are great - all have pools, are well appointed, spacious and clean. These villas are rated and priced as luxury so there were a few things we weren’t expecting…holes in curtains, patchy paintwork, bathrobes that needed stitching; however despite these small oversights, the Celestia Grands is really a lovely place to stay and the views of course are amazing. The property is about a 5 minute drive to Fira or a good walk along the coastal road. The thing that makes Celestia Grand truly great though is Niko. He is like a general manager, concierge, history teacher, tour guide; all wrapped up in one lovely man. He’s dedication to guests goes over and above expectations. Want a car, he gets it delivered; need medicine, he goes and gets it; on a ridiculously early flight when departing, he'll get up even earlier to make you breakfast. Also, Niko's island tips should be definitely be adhered to...his restaurant recommendations are especially good! He made our holiday extra special.",1
"My husband, 2 children and I spent 3 days in the Aphrodite Villa in July, and it was spectacular! Niko welcomed us from the moment we arrived and kindly sent us over to the neighboring hotel for breakfast since we had an extremely early flight to Santorini and had not eaten! He told us about the island and provided a map and places not to miss list! My children loved our private pool and the view is undescribable! I have traveled extensively and have never been so blown away by an island as Santorini and the Celestia Grand! Hope to return someday!!!",0
"We made last minute reservations at the Celestia Grand villas because we had to adjust our destination due to flight delays. And I am so very glad we had the chance to stay at these villas! It was easily the nicest place we've ever vacationed. It's a lovely and a very romantic place, which is perfect for couples. The hotel itself is beautiful and the view spectacular, but the staff is really the star of this spot. Niko is just outstanding! He made us feel perfectly at home. As he knew we were only spending 2 days on the island he helped coordinate everything to make sure we got to the most out of our time. I cannot wait to go back.",0
"There are not enough words to explain how amazing this place is. My husband and I booked the Erotas room for our honeymoon but the day before we got there we were pleasantly surprised that Niko, the man who makes this hotel amazing, upgraded us to the honeymoon villa. The honeymoon villa is the most beautiful room/terrace that I have ever seen. The views are astonishing. You wake up every morning and you want to pinch yourself because you don't believe that that view is real life. Breakfast is served on your beautiful terrace every morning and its just delicious. Now, the most important part of this hotel is the manager, Niko. He is everything you need for your stay in Santorini. He will lay out all the information you need about the island and what you should or shouldn't do. He is just AWESOME. We miss him already!! Thank you Niko for everything you did for us on our honeymoon. We will definitely be back!",1
"We stayed at Celestia Grand for 4 nights and it was absolutely a dream Holiday. When we arrived we were more then welcomed by Mr. Nico who after all made our stay wonderful. All our restaurant, car, sailing etc. rezervations where made by him, he actually organized all our trip with the best spots. He was always there for our questions and everything. Thank you for all that. We had an upgrade for our villa, we stayed at villa Artemis but we realized that all villas where wonderful and had an amazing breathtaking view. We could spend the entire time at our villa and our private villa. Breakfast was excellent, brought to your villa. The villa was very clean, room service is excellent. Lovely jacuzzi inside the bathroom and another lovely jacuzzi we had at the front outside our room with the caldera view. We had the best holiday, it was like a dream and can't wait to go back soon. Thank you Celestia Grand for everything.",2
"This was our second visit two years in a row staying at Celestia Grand Villas. We brought my mother-in-law this time because it was on her bucket list and we stayed in the Sapphire Villa. The views are out of this world. The master bath is humongous with a walk-in shower which was really nice. There's plenty of room to spread around so you definitely are not on top of each other. Niko treated us like we were king and queen every single day. I can't imagine that any other place could combine a wonderful room(villa), top-notch concierge service, and phenomenal views. Our personal pool was large, clean, and warm enough to swim in and there is also a hot tub. Breakfast is served every morning to you at your villa and is delicious. Your ride anywhere is taken care of by Niko. We will definitely be going back for our third stay with Niko and that amazing view!",2
We stayed here for 3 days during the Christmas week. We were amazed by the beauty of the place and luxurious villas. It's a lovely romantic place. Perfect for couples. the villas can easily accommodate around 6-8 people. The outdoor jacuzzi is brilliant. Due to the rough weather we couldn't use the private pool but when the sun shone... My god the view is just brilliant outside.The facilities are first class with an indoor jacuzzi as well. The staff and the manager (forgot his name) were very nice and gave us tips on what to do first and which are the best places to goto. They also took care of our vegetarian needs through the stay. Also there are enough places to order from if one wishes to. Overall it's a wonderful place to stay in and one can just roll in the luxury and relax. We were totally rejuvenated after our trip around the mainland Greece. The place is totally worth the price. Loved it. Highly highly recommended.,2
"Just got back from a week's stay at the Celestia Grand and we are already thinking about when we can get back. Everything was perfection, from the great location, the clean, open-airy suites and the private pool overlooking the beautiful sea. On top of all that, there was Nico, who made sure every excursion we took was perfectly planned, and every dinner we ate, was at the best restaurant with the best table. Having that knowledgeable person to guide you is an invaluable service and one that we can say completely made our trip. Run don't walk to the Celestia Grand. There is not one thing you will not love. Perfect all around.",1
"We stayed at Celestia Grand for 4 nights in the Artemis villa and it was simply outstanding. The villas are very spacious and airy. We had a private pool overlooking the volcano. I would have been content just laying on the float in the pool and looking out at the view the entire trip. Breakfast is brought to your villa on the deck each morning and offers a very nice variety. They also treated us to wine and fruit the night we arrived. Nico was the most helpful manager I have ever encountered staying at a hotel. He made himself available to make restaurant reservations, car reservations, schedule breakfast...you name it. Thank you, Nico! The best place we have ever treated ourselves to!   Room Tip: Artemis was the best! See more room tips",0
"Memories of this place will stay forever such a special place. Total luxury, amazing views, so serene an peaceful you don't want to leave. Niko is amazing he may have ESP he knows what you want when and how - he made the stay just the best of our holiday! The breakfasts on the terrace he organised were the best Ive had, he booked great restaurant seats great sunset cruise he organised car hire and suggested fantastic places to visit that we wouldn't have found on our own never have we come across such service and it is worth the money ! We will definitely be back   Room Tip: best views, best service ever See more room tips",1
"My girlfriend and I stayed at Villa 1 for three nights at the end of June. We had an amazing time, facilitated brilliantly by Nico who made himself available at all hours to respond to our needs. His advice and guidance on the local excursions and restaurants meant that our 3 1/2 days were very well spent and we left feeling like we experienced the best of Santorini. The Celestia Grand delivered exactly the kind of exclusive and high-end experience we were looking for when we booked. It is set slightly outside of the main town of Fira and all of the villas have gorgeous views of the caldera. All of the rooms are incredibly spacious and well appointed.There are a variety of breakfasts, served to you on your private terrace each morning - other than this you are basically left alone to enjoy your beautiful private villa environment. Any logistical support you need can be arranged simply and quickly via a call to Nico.We have both travelled significantly around the world and agreed this was among the very best five star experiences we've ever had... We wracked our brains to think of what suggestions we could make for improvement and we could only come up with replacing the standard coffee machines in the rooms with Nespresso machines! And that's just us being really picky...The Celestia Grand provided us with luxury, privacy, excellent service and gorgeous food. There is no question that we will return one day, perhaps even as early as next summer.",0
The hotel manager Mr. Niko is unparalleled to any manager at any hotel I've ever stayed at. He went over and beyond to make our stay pleasurable. He truly is one of a kind. He gave us the best recommendations and they were always spot on. Will definitely go back.,0
"If you book a room at the Celestia Grand you will not be disappointed. This was one of the most fabulous hotels we have ever experienced. We stayed in the Artemis Suite which had the most spectacular view you can imagine. The personal pool (which was spotlessly clean), overlooked this incredible view. But the truth is, there are stunning views and fabulous hotels all over the world. So what sets this one apart? Niko! He is the manager of the hotel and he makes all the difference between a great hotel room and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He was so dedicated to making sure our vacation was everything we wanted it to be - he is a gem. Niko went so far above and beyond making our trip perfect - from getting us reservations at the best restaurants, to making sure we had our favorite foods delivered for breakfast, to entertaining us with his stories and jokes - that by the time we left we felt like part of his family. But, here is the downside to staying at the Celestia Grand - you have to leave eventually, and that will cause some post-vacation depression, so don't say you weren't warned! You'll arrive back home only to find that Niko is still back in Greece, and you'll realize that there's no one around who cares where you have reservations for dinner, or what excursions you have planned for the day, or whether or not there is fresh-squeezed orange juice being served at breakfast. So enjoy every minute at the Celestia - you will definitely miss it when your stay is over!!!   Room Tip: The Artemis Suite is perfection!!!!! See more room tips",1
What a wonderful stay in Santorini! Lots of beautiful sights to see but this place was so lovely my wife didn't want to leave the hotel! We stayed in the Aphrodite Villa and it was spotlessly clean and was full of comforts to make us feel at home.I have to say that Jim's dad AKA Nico was an amazing host and a true gent!Will be back for sure!!! :),0
"Best holiday ever, the memories could never be erased and most of this was down to Niko. From arrival to departure the advice, kindness and service Niko provides is exceptional and he will ensure he makes your stay and experience in Santorini the best.We stayed at two villas during our stay as once I found this place, I was determined to spend our duration here as I wanted something that little bit special to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We stayed at both the Aphrodite and Sapphire. Both villas were beautiful, spacious, clean with private pools and amazing views. The breakfasts on the terrace every morning made to your choice were perfect and in a tranquil setting you really did feel like you were in paradise.The complex is in a great location, close enough to get to everything but far enough to enjoy the peace and quiet and the weather was fantastic.The only disappointing thing I can say is that this holiday came to an end but we will definitely be returning so Niko don't leave and hope to see you again soon, thank you for a brilliant holiday, we miss you very much from all of us x   Room Tip: All rooms will be perfect See more room tips",0
"All the praise for the Celestia Grand is not exaggerated. This is one of the most special places I have ever visited. We stayed in the Ianthi Villa, which, though certainly not cheap is less expensive than the other villas that come with swimming pools, and we could not believe how luxurious it is. The pool and the terrace are huge, and the views of the caldera and the Aegean are simply breathtaking. We booked it as a couple, but a friend happened to be visiting Greece at the same time, and for an additional fee he came over from Athens and stayed in the second suite. We were so happy we could take full advantage of the entire villa in this way. (One slight negative is that the beds in the second bedroom are rather hard.) The main potential problem with the hotel is the distance it is from the various towns that are a must to visit--a problem easily solved by renting a car, which I see as a necessity. All the superlatives in these reviews regarding the solicitude and helpfulness of Nikos are entirely justified. He was great! I don't think I've ever been so sad to leave a place.",0
"We spent five nights at Celestia Grand for our honeymoon in late May. We were in the Artemis Villa and can honestly say that this is the most beautiful place we have ever stayed!The villa was gorgeous inside and out, with a large terrace with a private pool and hot tub, both with amazing views. There was also a large jacuzzi tub inside and the whole villa was luxurious and very well appointed. The breakfasts served on our private terrace were just amazing! The location of the villas is perfect. The views are amazing and the villas are very private. There is a bakery and mini-mart just across the road and a regular shuttle runs to Fira which is just a short drive away. But what made our stay truly special was the villa manager Niko. From the moment we arrived he was so incredibly accommodating. He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and helped us with our sailing excursion and ATV bookings. His knowledge of the island is incredible and his recommendations of things to do and places to visit were top notch! We can't thank Niko and the rest of the villa staff enough for helping to make our honeymoon so special.",0
"What can I say that someone already hasn't....Nikolas was so informative and made you feel like royalty. We were in the honeymoon suite with the most gorgeous views of the cliffs, sunsets, and so romantic. Definitely get a car...it's cheap & worth it!!!",0
"We decided to splurge for the Santorini stay on our Greek island trip and have no regrets having stayed at this great (albeit expensive) luxury villa. We were upgraded to the largest villa with the best views for two days, then moved to the Honeymoon prime villa which was smaller but equally as great. Bathroom decor in Cycladic style was a constant source of visual pleasure. the outdoor and indoor jacuzzis were wonderful. When we were there the private pool was still a little brisk and it was a little windy for our blood so it served as a photographic treat only. We did spend much time on the huge patio/terrace with unbelievable views of the caldera , islands, Oia, and cliffside buildings.As stated, the service was outstanding. This was all due to the amazing , attentive manager of the villa, Nikos Dinos. He personally chaffeured us several times instead of ordering us a taxi. His recommendations and information were extremely helpful. He arranged for some small amount of laundry service for us and we were not charged for this.He was friendly, warm, extremely capable and absolutely was the catalyst and key for making our stay at Celestia Grand Villas absolutely outstanding. Highly recommended. Thank you, Nikos!!!!",1
"Upon arrival, we were personally met by the manager, Nikko. Not only was he super nice, but he accommodated us (with our 2 little kids) 100%. Because my husband and I are training for a fitness competition, Nikko was able to provide us with a breakfast that met our dietary needs and on top of that, made exactly what we wanted for the kids. He even went and got chicken for me, even though it wasn't a normal part of the breakfast menu! That's service!Not only did he organize the itinerary for our entire trip, he also accommodated my husband and I when we wanted to hit the gym nearby (he had one of his cleaning staff watch over the kids while they napped) - very generous! He also organized a private tour with Marco, who took us to many beautiful sites and ended the night off with a reserved table at one of the finest restaurants in Oia (with 360 views and the famous sunset view). We absolutely loved the tour as well as the food in the restaurant. Both Marco and Costa (who either drove us somewhere or toured us) were SENSATIONAL as well!!!!What an exceptional hotel with exceptional customer service!! Nikko you were outstanding - thank you for making our stay wonderful!!!",0
"My husband and I stayed at Celestia Grand for our honeymoon, and it was truly incredible. Niko, the manager, was incredibly accommodating--he helped us book our excursions on the island, explained its history, and showed us popular places to visit nearby. If we ever needed to book anything (rental car, sailing trip, etc.), we just called Niko and he helped us. The villa itself was incredible. We stayed in the Sapphire Villa, which had two rooms, its own pool and hot tub, and a gigantic indoor tub. The views of the caldera were truly stunning--I couldn't imagine a more beautiful place. The breakfasts they brought us every morning were absolutely delicious--eggs, Greek yogurt, bread, orange juice, coffee--they had it all. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough--if you're considering staying on Santorini, you can't find a better place than Celestia Grand. Thank you, Niko!!",0
"Fantastic hotel on the caldera. Every cliff-side hotel will boast wonderful views, the Celestia goes above and beyond with the size of its rooms, their privacy, the superb quality of the facilities, and the amazing service given by Nikos...detailed by everyone else who's reviewed this property. (oh - and the breakfast is amazing).",0
"The stunning view of the mountain, sea and bay. The large pool and room. The Korres toiletries. The excellent service of Niko. I don't even know where to start to compliment this hotel. Niko is the man to take care everything for you - from the itinerary to car rental to fetching you to and fro airport to yacht rental. Although we were skeptical of the yacht rental initially, it turned out to be the best decision ever. I was having a hard time to choose between the yacht experience and visiting a mountain in Switzerland as my favorite experience throughout my one month holiday. The car was at a reasonable rate and delivered and collected from the villa. I love the rooms. They were huge. I love the toiletries as I usually like high end toiletries like Bvlgari, L'Occitane or Crabtree and Evelyn, Korres is definitely good for me. Centrally located near Fira - which has more and cheaper restaurants and shopping as compared to Oia which you can do a day trip instead (where the famous blue dome church is located). Niko cooked the breakfast btw and just trust him to make your stay perfect, he will plan everything for you. Although may be replying email faster will be good before the trip, but I understand he might be very busy :).",0
"Where to start, a great location and facilities, topped off by the knowledge and assistance of the concierge, Niko. My wife and I had booked the junior suite, and we were warmly welcomed and shown around by Niko. He provided us with some basic history of Santorini, as well as details of places that we might like to see or eat at. This was all tailored to our stay and how we felt after travel. He also made his sightseeing suggestions in light of the local weather reports which turned out to be very accurate. Our room was large, comfortable, had two outside areas for relaxing, and magnificent views out over the caldera. Breakfast was to have been served to the rooftop of our villa to take advantage of the views, but unfortunately the weather did not allow this so we ate in the small dining room. It was both generous and delicious. We followed Niko's suggestions through our stay regarding tours and where to eat, and were not disappointed with anything. On our final night, Niko suggested that we dine at an out of the way family style restaurant which we gladly accepted. He made the bookings and drove us to the restaurant where we had a great time. Good views, good food and friendly service. While we very much enjoyed our stay at the Celestia Grand, I must say that Niko's advice and assistance was the icing on the cake. Thanks.   Room Tip: All suites have great views. The junior suite only has a Jacuzzi rather than the pools that the othe... See more room tips",0
"I recently travelled to Santorini with my sister. We wanted to stay somewhere with a Caldera view and chose Celestia Grand. Although the price was a little higher than we had hoped (converted Australian dollars was $3011 for five days) but 1995 euros, the view was spectacular and the villa looks exactly like the pictures. We stayed in Ianthi and I wish I had chosen a more expensive suite with a Jacuzzi as the weather did not allow us for swimming in the private pool (although I did get into it but it was icy!). However the bathroom in Ianthi has a spa bath but we never used it as it was too hard to get in and out of for us (age related). The villa is lovely and spacious, spotlessly clean, has a tiled staircase indoors as well as steps to the terrace when you walk out of your room, two spacious bedrooms, beds were very comfortable. Compared to other sites in Santorini I felt the steps were manageable for two elderly ladies such as ourselves! The bathrooms were a little tired and need replacing, but manageable. The manager, Niko told us this was on the agenda for 2016 so once they are done, the villa would be perfect. The breakfast served to either your room or terrace (try to have at least one on your terrace, its sensational view) was plentiful and beautifully cooked and served to you by wonderful waiters. You will never eat all the food choices....it was great. Niko met us on arrival and carried our very heavy bags to our villa, he rang us each night to check on breakfast time and choice. He also took us to a taverna one night in his own car so we didn't have to pay for a taxi both ways....what an amazing manager! I am a manager of a large medical practice and I have never seen customer service like his....I wish I could clone him and bring him to my company! What amazing service, nothing was too much for him, he attended to things immediately and organised our sightseeing with suggestions, but is not overly intrusive, if you wanted to be left alone, he would do so. We wanted to try different places for meals and he suggested amazing places (do try Lucky's for a quick lunch in Fira, best Gyros I have ever tasted) and the taverna he chose was amazing, the tour around the island sensational and we had pre booked on the internet ourselves a boat trip, but you could go with one he suggests and organises as well. There is a shuttle bus in and out of Fira which was easy to get. Taxis are relatively cheap around $7 euros. Nothing is too much trouble and he is the heart and soul of the villa and the reason I would return with my husband and family hopefully next year......I wouldn't stay anywhere else, the view, the service, the friendliness of it all made us feel like we were staying with family. It was amazing. Thank you Niko and staff, our stay in Santorini was the highlight of our trip.   Room Tip: Pay a bit extra for a Jacuzzi and pool in case of inclement weather,but most villas have sensational... See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Celestia Grand for our honeymoon and we could not have dreamt of a better experience. The views are breathtaking and the villa was awesome, spacious and beautiful. Besides the amazing location and the beautiful property, the service was outstanding! We appreciated the transportation to and from the airport, a shuttle to and from the closest city, and, most of all, the inside scoop on where to go and what to see from our gracious host (the hotel manager) Niko. He provided us with detailed information on what to see and when and how to get there. His restaurant recommendations could not be beat and he helped us schedule an ATV for a day, ordered our cabs for us, and just made the trip so easy and enjoyable! Thank you Niko for hosting us and we will definitely be back, hopefully soon!",0
"We went to many hotels as we travelled a lot. The room, view, location, services, facilities were great, but that were what we expected. But what surprised us was Mr Niko, the manager, you will never meet any manager like Mr Niko. When I asked for 10, I got 12, more than what I expected. He is the heart, the brain, the hands, the legs of the hotel. Just follow his advise, you will have the most out of Santorini!!! Oh, and we got upgraded too, guess who did that???",0
"Went for the honeymoon villa (Sofi Anna) for my honeymoonWe got picked up from the airport with a driver standing with my name on a placard , within 15 mins we reached the villa after a tiring 16hrs journey from mumbai via abu dhabi and athens.We were greeted in the parking lot by Niko , the concierge and the property manager, we were the taken to a small office, were checked in , given an orientation of the island and places to visit by Niko (he gives a list and marks them on a map for you) , then straight to the villa for a night's sleepNext morning , we wake up to a beautiful view from the terrace and a hot breakfast waitinf there for us ( we are strictly vegetarian , niko made crepes for us)Over the next three days , he arranged for a self driven car rental , ferry tickets, sailboat tickets , you name it , niko is there 16hrs a day to attend to your requestNow about the villa , absolutely stunning , designed like a cave , you enter into a pantry area followed by the bedroom and living room and then into a cave like bathroom with a 2person jacuzzi Absolutely amazing , will return in the fiture for a stay and also recommend to friends (though also got a recommend by 2 friends about the villa property)#1 in tue Fira area on TA at the time of this review ,hope it stays there for a long time",1
"just spent a week in celestia grand and there is not enough words to describe how perfect the location is and how spectacular the view of the villa is. Nico planned everything for us and the catamaran cruise is the most memorable experience we had of santorini. Imagine waking up with the view of the caldera and watching the sunset on the balcony of your villa, priceless.. Nico takes care of you like his own family, He is the heart and soul of celestia grand, His dedication to his work is equal to none. Cant wait to come back.",1
"1st thing i need to mention was the utmost detail and thoughtfulness of niko(Neili Antoniadou), ive never been treated so warm(genuine) and kind from a manager in all my years traveling(i.e, activities, food, rentals, ideas, etc). i had a few hiccups in my time in Athens which i expressed via email to niko prior to my arrival, that experience left an overall blemish to my idea of what Greece was, so w that being said niko made it an obligation/commitment to fully redirect/change my feelings which he successfully achieved. enough of nikos superhuman qualities, lets get to the actual residence. the hotel/villa is exactly what i wanted, privacy+location + high end=celestial grand. the rooms are large enough to accommodate 6 people but it was only us 2 lovebirds. the villa had a private pool, terrace and a view that would be impossible to describe w words (yes, sounds annoying and obnoxious but sooo true:). i recommend the catamaran, its 100% worth it and yes, its a bit of a splurge, but arent you worth it? overall you will come back home w an appreciation of Greece and its people and admire the hospitality of Niko, trust me, you will. thanks again, and do yourself a favor, rent an ATV, its worth it, its almost impossible to get lost:)",0
"Went here for a few days at the end of March and was absolutely delighted with my stay. The villa we stayed in was great, so clean and huge with private pool and the most amazing views. The hotel was still in off-season mode so overall services cut back a little bit but we received such a good service and help from Nico, we didn't miss anything! A great place to stay to chill out, and free shuttle bus to Fira (or 25min walk) for nightlife and restaurants.",0
"Just checking out today , we really had a wonderful time here especially with Nikos help and suggestions .Amazing panoramic view of the volcano , superb breakfast and excellent service and on top of that very nice people in the facility Nikos always suggested the best thing to do during The cold season especially that we came with kids .Thank you very much - we really had fun Mohammed's family -- SA",0
"This place is dreamy!!! Our magical journey started from the moment we were picked up at the airport by Nikos the manager. Nikos planned our daily activities for us during our 4 night-stayed in Celestia. The pictures of other travelers did not do justice for this Villa. It's true that Nikos and his team went out his way to please customers. He treated his customers like family. Due to low season, the town was little dead but it did not affect how much we love Santorini. This is a must visit island for everyone once in a life time!! You will not regret by staying at Celestia Grand. p.s. Hi Nikos, we are the ""truly happy"" girls from California! Thanks for your amazing arrangements during our stay!!! You are the best!!",0
"We booked the Ianthi Villa and although it sure looks amazing from the photos nothing prepares you for this magnificent place you going to be. Stunning! This particular villa has actually a panoramic, breathtaking view of the Caldera. The location of the villa and the pool area, gives you also the desired privacy. Stunning bedrooms large pool and spacious terrace area. The service was above excellent and almost 24 hours available. Everything we asked whenever we asked. We had lunch and breakfast at the private terrace. Delicious food and moreover a unique experience to lunch in private enjoying this terrific view. Also, the perfect romantic breakfast to start your day. Comfortable sunbeds. A truly luxury stay. Even for the most demanding. Can't wait to go back. Hint: Check the weather conditions, if it's too windy you might get a lot of sand in the room and pool area.",1

"I went there with my wife during our honeymoon for 3 Days only on mid of January, Mr. Niko was there to catch us up from the airport, he prepared and arrange everything as perfect, he answered all the questions that we asked and gave us the recommendations that we need to use to make it special nights at Santorini.Really this man is unbelievable man he takes care of every small details that you need or may be you are going to face during your stay, he is up there 24/7 just you need to call him and he will be come to you at any time you need him. the villa was containing PC, Tel, Two Balconies, private pool, heater, beverage and iron with its board. seriously the service was the best service i have had in my life and the stay was unforgettable days.Thank you very much Mr. Niko for your marvelous effort you did.

A great place to stay after a hectic on the go tour of Europe. Niko the manager was awesome and the rest of the staff were friendly. The resort felt like home.

Mr Greg (manager) came to pick up despite i had booked hire car so that we could find the Villa in the dark.

"Spent three nights here during our honeymoon. Villa was spectacular, and lived up to the website's photos. The property manager went above and beyond providing complimentary airport transfers, an excellent tour recommendation (taking care of all bookings and tickets), and even getting me a birthday cake! Definitely hope to return again.",1
"Excellent from the start to the end, the hotel manager Niko is the best I have met in our travels so far. Niko picked us up from the airport and also dropped us off on our return trip. Niko had the perfect recommendations for things to do when you're there and he arranged everything for us. We got to experience all the tours and sights on the island. The breakfast was so fresh and delicious every morning, accompanied with the friendly nice staff. By far the best Greek yogurt we have had. The hotel location was perfect for couples and scenic pictures. The location was very private and quiet and it offered one of the best views on the island in our opinion. The hotel rooms were very clean, spacious and had everything we needed. We will definitely come visit again! Thank you Niko!   Room Tip: Every room is good!! See more room tips",2
"Celestia Grand is the perfect choice for couples who need privacy and relax. The view was spectacular and the room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Niko, the concierge of the villas was there for us all the time and he gave us the best recommendations for the island. The best recommendations: 1. The boat trip with captain Ted which was a unique experience and we took great pictures of the volcano.2. Also, he suggested us to have a photo tour by Kimonas Photography who took us to the hotspots of Santorini so we have the perfect memories in professional pictures. I would totally recommend you to choose Celestia Grand Villas for your summer vacation in this magical island!",0
"When my wife and I made our (last minute) plans for our 10 year anniversary, we found that many places were closed for the season, so we made a 5 day reservation at the best place we could find with a fairly good location and hoped for the best. The next day we got an email from the parent company of the hotel, saying we'd been “upgraded” due to the low season. But what was this place we were upgraded to? I logged onto TripAdvisor and searched, and saw nothing but glowing review after glowing review! How could this be true? Especially when I've been told all my life, that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is? With every review I read to my wife, our expectations grew and so did my trepidation.I should never have worried. Our treatment was five star all the way.We stepped out of the airport to a Eugene Levy look-alike who introduced himself as Nikos. We got a complimentary ride to the villas, and he gave us a personal tour of the room – the Sapphire Villa. It is a two bedroom suite, but one of the bedrooms was closed off while we were there. Were we hungry, he wanted to know. Yes, we were. Next followed a complimentary ride to one of the best restaurants in Fira, and Nikos pointed out the taxi stand for our ride back after some amazing Greek food and wine. After that we enjoyed the luxurious tub in our room (unfortunately the automatic runoff was plugged, and the bubbles didn't work but the jets did). Do you need a powerful hair dryer? There's one provided in the room. The next morning began with an amazing reveal as we opened the shutters to our private pool terrace, complete with a hot tub. The view – words cannot do it justice. The pictures you see on TripAdvisor – do you see how the professional ones and the photos taken by guests are nearly identical? This isn't by chance – it really is that amazing. Next came the complimentary breakfast - Nikos in the kitchen, taking orders – fresh greek yogurt with fruit, eggs cooked to order, bacon, fried potatoes, crepes – before you could comprehend how tasty one dish was, another was appearing in front of you. The only regret was that the weather was too cold to be served on our private terrace, but the conversation with the other guests more than made up for it.Next came the list – you've seen it mentioned in other reviews – Nikos walked us through his list of 10 spots to visit – and after he rented us a car, we tried nearly every one of them and were not disappointed. Nikos also arranged a guided bus tour, he was our taxi driver to both sights and dining locations, and arranged our boat trip to the volcano island. My wife was worn out from the hike on the island, so he booked a massage therapist named Mickey,, who is from England but has lived on island for over 20 years. There's no place to rate her on TripAdvisor but she was worth every penny! I experienced no problems with the complimentary wifi as I relaxed by the pool while her spa treatment was in progress.When it was finally time for the ride back to the airport, we knew we would miss Santorini but we'd miss Nikos even more. Without a doubt, it was his efforts, humor and exceptional service that helped make this our trip of a lifetime. So, believe the reviews – this place is that good!   Room Tip: The Sapphire Suite has the best view - there are quite a few stairs to get back up to street level. See more room tips",4
"Nicco is just superb, he made us feel right at home. The views are enchanting and nothing comes close.The villas are exquisite and no 6 is the boom! Private pool,jacuzzi, hot tub little fridge home theatre in the bedroom. Very well equipped.Anniversary is turning out to be the honeymoon we never had. Loving it!",3
"""Be silent;or say something better than silence. "" - Pythagoras It is only just that we have to mention that we are very impressed with the accommodation and service.Had a great stay here with my wife at the honeymoon suite for our honeymoon. Though it's not right at the core of Fira, you will quickly appreciate the reason why you have chosen CG. Theres shuttle service at intervals and the drop off point is near a bus station if you wanna explore the island on your own. Enjoyed our stay and as Arnold Schwarzenegger will say - ""I'll be back"".",0
"When we got to the Santorini airport Niko was there to pick us up with happy and helpful vibes. He told us a little about island and its history which was very interesting. From the very begin Niko was the best and most helpful and made us feel right at home. His food recommendations were outstanding. We would definitely come back and stay here! Thanks again Niko, celetria grand villas and the whole crew.",0
"The service and stay here were top notch. The manager, Niko, told us that he would be our ""mother"" for our stay and he was just that. He made great suggestions for restaurants and activities. He set us up with a great guide for a half day tour. He seemed to know what we needed even before we asked for it. He picked us up at the airport and asked if we had eaten dinner. When we said we had not, he dropped us off at a nice restaurant where we had a great meal and then picked us up afterwards. In the meantime, all of our luggage was taken to the room. Being the low season, we were sent a disclaimer that some services at the hotel would not be available, but other than breakfast being served in the common area rather than in our villa, I can't imagine what was lacking. Our experience was outstanding in every way!",1
"Ok .. so you want a beautiful place to stay in Santorini ... well this is it ... but that's not the best part!! The place is a uniquely (over the top) beautiful and Romantic, but the thing or rather the PERSON who puts it over the top and makes you feel like you are the only guest that matters or is staying there is NIKO.I've been in the Luxury end of the Hospitality Business for 30 years and worked for the best of the best and I know a quintessential Host when I met one. Niko is everything you could want in a Hotel GM. Genuine, Humorous, Attentive, Organized, Caring, (Just pull out a Thesaurus) and you'll get the picture.Don't bother to stay anywhere else in Greece (or Europe for that matter) ... we Started in Athens then went to Rome and even the Amalfi Coast and no one could touch the friendliness and warmth that Niko showed us.Sunsets from the balconies stunning ... the best I've seen in my 53 years.Shopping is great.The Island MagnificentOh and did I mention a Magnificent Host and staff?We WILL be back and so will you if you take that first step and book this property   Room Tip: Get one with a full pool See more room tips",1
"Niko is an absolute legend and did everything he possibly could to ensure we had the best time in Santorini - so accommodating and friendly! We could not have asked for anything more from him. He goes above and beyond the call of duty and all this is on top of the absolutely spectacular villas (and breakfasts provided!!) thank you again Niko, I will definitely be back in the future!! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Perfect!",0
"From the moment you arrive here you realize that this is going to be a unique and special experience. We were taken to our private 2-story Villa complete with a huge patio area and large private pool with breathtaking views of the Caldera. A wine and cheese reception soon followed where we met the primary reason to stay at this hotel - the Hotel Manager Nikos Dinos. Nikos spent about 90 minutes with us reviewing the history of Santorini, understanding what we wanted to do while we were there and working with us to make sure we got the most out of our stay on this amazing island. We put ourselves completely in his hands and as a result we had what we would describe as the perfect Santorini experience. So for anyone traveling to Santorini my advice would be ""Stay at the Celestia Villas and then do everything Nikos tells you to do"".The breakfast on your patio is made to order and delicious. Most of it is native to Greece so the yogurt and fruits are to die for. There is a lot of food provided. In fact, we had to ask them to bring a little less because there was no way we could eat it all.Before booking a Villa, I would suggest giving Nikos a call to discuss the various options. Each of the 7 villas is quite unique in terms of room size, location, views and price. A consultation prior to booking your villa will ensure you have the vacation you want.Finally, I'd like to relate an experience we had that illustrates the level of service you may expect. We had decided not to rent a car (I don't like driving in foreign countries) and were quite prepared to pay for taxis whenever we needed them. One evening, Nikos had made arrangements for us to visit the Santo Winery for sunset and then to have dinner at an amazing off the beaten track restaurant in Pyrgos called Metaxi Mas. We expected to take a taxi to and from each location. Instead, Nikos had some time and drove us to the winery, made sure we had a good table to view the sunset, picked us up at the winery and took us to dinner and picked us up from dinner and drove us back to the hotel. Totally unexpected but greatly appreciated. Once again...stay at the Celestia Villas and then do everything Nikos tells you to do..   Room Tip: Speak with the hotel manager Nikos Dinos prior to booking your villa See more room tips",3
"Great trip. Great island. Great villas.Two stories with lots of room and multiple bathrooms. Three patios overlooking the sea. Much larger than we expected, which was a pleasant surprise.Every detail is taken care of by Niko and staff. He takes the time to understand who you are and what interests you have before providing suggestions for sights, eats, and sunsets. Quite frankly, the best sunset on the island in Nov was on our pool patio.We will be back to Santorini and no doubt will return to the villas.",0
"Thanks to Niko and the team for the fabulous time we had in Santorini! Everything from the villa, breakfast, cleanliness was simply perfect. Niko greeted our family of 2 adults and 3 kids on arrival after our complimentary pick up from the airport, gave us some time to freshen up before giving us an overview of the island and things to do over the next few days. He ordered us a delivery as we had arrived around 3 and were starving! It was very good as we then ordered from the same place for 2 more nights!We were in the sapphire villa which is right at the cliff end. Nicely secluded and not really overlooked. The view from the pool area is just stunning! You are right in front of the volcano and if weather permitting can just sit out there watching the cruise ships go by. The villa has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a lounge with sofa bed. Wifi speed is good and everywhere on the villa grounds. As it was cold, breakfast was served in the dining room. Breakfast is absolutely lovely: eggs any way you like, crepes, yogurt, honey, cheese, cereal, freshly squeezed orange juice..you name it they will have it.Niko organised our tours so we were well taken care of. There is a free shuttle into Fira 4 times a day and if you can't make that the taxi into firs is 7 euros. We travelled to Oia from Fira via bus which cost 1.80 euros for the adults. There are many ways to get around. Niko treated us like his family and really looked after us v well.We will be back to Celestia! Thank you xx",0
"We have travelled to so many countries and stayed in so many hotels. But, Celestia Grand is different. Beautiful hotel, wonderful views makes it just perfect. Mr Niko makes hotel lively. I have never seen a hotel manager like him. He is ready to do anything to make guests happy. He dropped us personally to Town whenever requested. I had a small medical issue and he took me personally to health centre. He sets everything for you, all that is required is to make a wish.One of the very few hotels that allows children and you can book this hotel without any second choice.",1
"We were staying at the villas at the same time as the last reviewer , have to say she has got it spot one. Every one was treated as a valued guest, Niko and his staff surpassed all our expectations. To be honest having read earlier reviews , I did wonder if the customer care might be intrusive. Nothing could be further from the truth. Niko and his staff just wanted you to enjoy Santorini and make the very best of your stay, in the most spectacular and awesome surroundings. Sunset cruise is a must , we hired a car enabling us to see more of the Island . Thank you Niko and all your staff you are a credit to Santorini , perfect ambassadors ! Villa Sapphire was absolutely luxurious , highly recommended",2

"We stayed at Celestia Grand in the Erotas Villa for 4 nights in October and what an amazing experience! Niko was wonderful, full of great suggestions and always helpful. He spoiled us with watermelon and feta (surprisingly a great combo), helped us arrange a great photographer and even gave us a ride into town! He truly made us feel like we were the only ones there. The staff were friendly and the rooms immaculate. The view of the caldera with the volcano was breathtaking from our room, especially during sunset. We even had our own private pool (I suggest bringing pool floats, most guests do). I highly recommend anyone coming to Santorini to stay here. You will not be disappointed!!",2
"We stayed at the Celestia Grand in the Aphrodite Villa for a 3 nights. Niko greeted us with wine and cheese, provided a history of the island and a list of activities he thought we would like. We had breakfast daily served to our room having given our choices to Niko. He gave us a ride to town the first night because we were too late for the shuttle. He made the trip the best part of our stay in Greece. We had our own pool too which was a first for me. You will be treated like royalty staying here!",1
"We stayed at the Celestia Grand in the Aphrodite Villa for a week. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! Niko greeted us with wine and cheese, provided a history of the island and a list of activities he thought we would like. He arranged a private tour of the island for us and made a dinner reservation as part of the tour. He arranged a sunset dinner cruise for us, making sure the cruise was scheduled for the best weather day. He personally drove us to different places on a moment's notice. He kept track of our whereabouts and showed concern that we were enjoying every day. He observed our daily breakfast request and suggested we change after we had the same breakfast for three days in a row. He even provided a float for our pool upon request. He suggested places we could visit that are frequented by the local citizens. He recommended the 24 hour bakery down the street for coffee and pastries any time of the day or night (we would highly suggest a visit to the bakery). Niko kept us apprised of all necessary transfers and was there to see us off to all activities. The entire staff was extremely accommodating, from the lovely young man who served our breakfast to the cleaning staff, who did an excellent job keeping both our rooms and our outside area spotless. We actually thought about extending our stay as it was the most accommodating, pampering place we have visited. Thank you Niko for everything you did. We know you provide the same excellent service to all your guests.Linda & CeC",1
"In September 2015, I stayed here for the third time with my two children. The views are incredible, the pools are large, the space is everything anyone would ever need. But the true beauty of this place, is Nick the hotel manager. He is hands down the only reason I was able to confidently travel to Santorini alone, knowing that he would accomodate our every need. The first time I came here I told him my son only drank goats milk and he drove up the moutain to a goat farm and brought me fresh milk within the hour. There isn't anything he doesn't try to do for his guest. I wanted a souflaki he had someone run and get one. I wanted Greek cheese pies for breakfast he brought me a variety to choose from. The kids requested donuts, they had donuts. The kids tried to order penne when they only had spaghetti, and he ran to get penne. The service Nick provides doesn't exist at the finest hotesl in the world. He is a gem, and the place is very lucky to have him. He set us up with an incredible tour guide, and an amazing sailing trip. When my cellphone broke, he was ready first thing in the morning to help me find a replacement. The location is central and that makes it easy to take day trips anywhere on the island. I have tried a variety of villas and you can't go wrong with any of them. The place is spotless. His staff is friendly. I can't think of a better place in the world!! Miss it!!",4
"It's very hard for me to find flaws with Celestia Grand. We went for our honeymoon and stayed in the Honeymoon Villa. The villa was stunning. Amazing view of the caldera, very romantic, secluded, and beautiful. The staff was extremely welcoming and very kind. Nikos was just as great, if not more so, than the reviews have pointed out. Not only did he give us a ton of great information, he booked us restaurant reservations, drove us into town on more than one occasion, and just never seemed annoyed at our calls about what to do, where to go, etc. He seems to truly love his job. He's very blunt, but listen to his recommendations! He's blunt for a reason. There are certain things you should do on the island that will create an amazing experience, and he points all of those out. Niko, if you read these, you truly made our experience/honeymoon one to remember. The breakfast is delicious and includes a ton of food. Check-in/check-out was extremely painless, and the airport transfer was there as we arrived and needed to depart.Overall, fantastic stay, and we cannot wait to come back for our 10 year anniversary.   Room Tip: Honeymoon suite is the most private, the villas have amazing views See more room tips",2
"I traveled with a group of friends and we stayed in the Villa Aphrodite. We knew a private villa was going to be amazing, but our experience at this hotel was on another level. The main reason our stay here was so incredible is all thanks to Nikos Dinos! He is the hotel manager and is truly someone that loves not only his job, but Santorini. Because of this, he wants to be sure his guests love it too. Upon arrival Nikos brought an amazing fruit platter, a couple bottles of wine, and told us all about the island and what he recommended for our stay. His recommendations were all fantastic! He arranged for our sunset sailing cruise (which was incredible, arguably my favorite thing from our trip), had ATVs waiting for us to explore the island as well as giving us a map with personal recommendations for where to go, and even drove us to dinner himself one evening when the shuttle wasn't available when we were ready to go! The villa was gorgeous and had fantastic caldera views. Breakfast was brought to out villa every morning and it was delicious! From Nutella crepes to eggs to yogurt and fruit, etc and it was all so good! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Between Nikos' expertise and the stunning views, I cannot imagine a better stay in Santorini!",2
"Welcomed by lovely Nick, we settled into the villa and enjoyed some wine and fruits whilst admiring the outstanding view of Caldera.We loved the amazing breakfasts served personally at our villa, truly a gold class experience.Words do not justify the service provided by Nick and his team.",1
"We had a fantastic time in Santorini! The Aphrodite villa was amazing-everything you could want in a villa right down to the private pool and amazing views. This was our second trip to Santorini but Celestial Grand made it beyond memorable. On this trip Santorini became a part of our family. My husband and I were with our adult children. We had amazing breakfasts and service! Niko is an amazing concierge! He not only knows the island well but what makes him great is knowing his clients and what they want. He was able to fulfill our every need to the point of us not having any needs. The birthday cake, champagne and the candle lit patio and pool was a wonderful - what a memorable night. Niko is amazing!   Room Tip: I'm sure all the villas are fantastic. We stayed in the Aphrodite Villa and it was amazing! See more room tips",3
"My husband & I recently stayed at The Celestia Grand Villa's. All I can say is AMAZING!!! The accommodation is fabulous & the views are absolutely stunning!!!! Our Concierge Nikos, was brilliant & catered to our every need with upmost sincerity. We would highly recommend these Villa's. Thank you once again Nikos for your humble hospitality & a big thank you to all the staff for making our little getaway most memorable",2
"First time to Santorini with the family - 2 children aged 12 and 8 years old. Spent a considerable amount of time trying to find a luxury hotel that would allow under 13s. Chose the Celestia Grand for a number of reasons - it reviews well (deserved), it is located slightly out of Fira (2 mins by car), it is located on the edge of the caldera (stunning views) and the villas are fully private with their own pools.The hotel deserves its rating. It met all of our expectations and then some. It provided a fantastic base from which we could explore the island.Difficult to do the views justice - they have to be seen to be believed - particularly at sunset.Special mention to all of the staff who were friendly, efficient and went out of their way to help. Particular special mention to Niko - the general manager, who was available to us 24 hours a day. I can safely say that in the last 20 years I have never come across a more committed hotel manager - his levels of energy and enthusiasm were staggering and he went out of his way to ensure every last detail of our stay was perfect, including restaurant bookings, an island tour, breakfasts on the terrace, catamaran, beach clubs......All in all a wonderful stay and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel   Room Tip: Stay back from the edge if you are scared of heights! See more room tips",1
"We stayed in the honeymoon villa at the Celestia Grand in July and our stay could not have been more perfect. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a bottle of wine and fruit at check in followed by a summary of the history of the island. Niko was fantastic and went out of his way to arrange day trips, restaurant bookings etc for us. We were unable to get a taxi back one evening and he arranged for someone to pick us up which we greatly appreciated. The staff even made us a cake for our anniversary and set it up on our terrace for when we returned from dinner. The service was exceptional. The villa itself and pool area was huge and the views were stunning - we will definitely be back! Thank you Niko for making our stay so memorable.",1
"Wonderful location with one of the best view on island. The hospitality of the stuff is great especially Niko the General Manager of the hotel is a great guy and he is very helpful and honest. Well organized and clean hotel, the breakfast is very good.",1
"Stayed at Villa Sapphire. Truly Spectacular views and pool/outdoor area is the best. The two bedrooms were good enough. Niko is a great host with great advice who made our time on the Island fantastic. 5-star view, 5-star service, 3/4-star rooms (somewhat expected on a Greek Island). As for the Island, Oia restaurants are great on view but high on price and poor on food. Suggest visiting morning/afternoon and eating dinner elsewhere. Visit some small towns like Megalochori.",3
"No question: this is a stunning property with incredible views, very attentive staff, an excellent breakfast, and an outstanding manager / concierge, Niko. In fact, Niko deserves his own ""star"" for the highly knowledgeable and professional service he provides. But for a top tier facility, some features could be improved. The shower in our master bathroom should be replaced, more trash receptacles are needed, and the wifi signal drops off considerably when you are by the pool. TA doesn't have a 4.5 star option which is a more accurate grade from this reviewer.",2
"All the comments are true.Wonderful place with excellent service and all because of Niko....He truly takes care of the customers.The Villas are well layed out and taken care of.Wonderful views right on the Caldera, which is where you want to be in Santorini.The whole family wants to come back.More cannot be said...as all has been said frorm the reviews.Do not hesitate..stay at The Celestia Grand Villas.",2
"Very helpful and friendly staff, awesome view right outside the room, super comfy room, incredible breakfast, celestia grand made our stay in santorini so memorable!We stayed for three days, and we are still talking about how nice this villa is and we long to come back someday.",1
"It's pretty much all been said, but just in case you still aren't convinced, here are a few more reasons.I booked Celestia as a surprise for my then girlfirend - the extra surprise being that I was planned to propose. We stayed in the Superior Honeymoon Villa and it was immaculate. My girlfiend (now wife) was left speechless (she obviously hadn't seen anything about it before we arrived). When Niko (more on him in a bit) opened the doors to the HUGE terrace, my wife cried... and then she realised it wasn't a communal area, and cried some more. (The pool in October was a bit fresh to say the least, but we braved it on a couple of occasions. I'm sure in the summer, it is beautifully warm as it would capture the sun for long periods of the day). Then in the morning, when she saw the view, and we had more tears. All good of course. It room was at the far side of the resort so was barely overlooked too. We had been told to call Niko in the morning when we were ready for breakfast, and we did just that. He said ""what do you want?""I said ""What do you have?""He said ""what do you want?""We ordered a few things, feeling a bit cheeky, but everything arrived to our room and it was all amazing. If the weather is nice, which it mostly was, they will ask if you want it on the terrace. And of course, you will say yes. One evening, we fancied staying in and having a takeaway. Niko ordered everything for us. I asked if they did any kind of dessert and dessert arrived. Turns out they didnt do dessert but Niko went to the bakery and got us something specially. No fuss, no bother.Niko also helped me plan my proposal - booking a driver and restraunt for later in the week, then putting out candles and bubbly on the terrace on our return, where I would pop the question. I popped the question a day early though, there was a moment on the terrace when it just felt right so took the leap! You may have gathered that she said yes.I told Niko that I no longer needed the plans for the following day and he sorted everything out, no problem. We went out for dinner that evening to celebrate and when we came back, there were candles, rose petals and a bottle of bubbly anyway. Niko was an absolute legend, whether its sorting you out car rental or fetching you cake, it just gets done. I have no idea how he keeps up that level of service for all of his guests - the man is a machine - but he maintains a wonderful demenour, calmness and an all round amazing personality.So, if you want to surprise your partner/husband/wife, take them to Celestia Grand and don't tell them anything about it beforehand. Everything that follows will blow their (and your) socks off. A wonderful place that we are already planning to revisit, thank you so much for making our engagement and unforgetable one, (and for making sure she couldn't possibly say no).

"This place is phenomenal. We stayed in the Saphire villa, which was incredible and I'm sure all the villas are amazing. Each villa include a big terrace with your own private pool. The property is beautiful and the staff is second to none. Nikos, the hotel manager, is wonderful. We stayed there with our two children and, thanks to Nikos, I actually felt like *I* was taken care of and I could completely relax!! Amazing views, beautiful villa, delicious food, wonderful staff, best hotel manager. Stop researching and book it.   Room Tip: There's only 6 villas all facing the water. Call them directly and talk to Nikos. He speaks perf... See more room tips",2
"Where to start ? First the wow effect of te view, sunset on the caldera on your private terrace with free drinks every evening.... just perfect!The staff is sooooo friendly! Chris is a great host always ready to help you out and Eddie, he is just smiles! All day he greets you with his friendly smile and doesn't mind climbing the numerous stairs to bring you your drink or food! Prices are beond reasonable too. It's all in the little attentions : daily water in the fridge, a little present when they bring you the weather forecast, the coffee and cake, the happy hour, ice cream at the pool...etc... Imerovigli is the best spot to me, less tourists than Oia and Fira and you're right in the middle of the island to start your journey with a car rental for example.Rooms are clean and true to the pictures. Only little downside is that there is not enough shade at the pool, but as we mostly were alone up there we didn't mind.I highly recommend Artemis Villas, but as everywhere in Santorini, be ready to climb stairs, a lot of them... ;-)   Room Tip: Everything above the studio is fine! See more room tips",1
"Santorini was our second stop on our honeymoon and we were so thankful to stay where we did! Staying in Imerovigli gives you the ability to visit both Fira and Oia easily without being overwhelmed by the amount of tourists. Imerovigli is quiet throughout the day and night but offers great restaurants if you do not want to head into either Fira or Oia. Artemis Villas was great! They picked us up from the boat dock and we were amazed at our bell man's suitcase carrying abilities. We were welcomed with fresh fruit, sparkling wine, and a few desserts. The room was always clean and they stopped in multiple times a day if you were not there to make sure you had everything you needed. We hiked a lot while there so it was great to always have a fresh bottle of water to grab and there was even more in the reception. Breakfast was served every morning on our little patio and the views were amazing. The pool is fabulous and the complimentary happy hour is a great perk after being in the heat all day. The staff is all wonderful and attentive without being overbearing. I highly recommend! (Our stay was June 2015)",0
"First time in Santorini but will definitely come back. Especially at Artemis Villa. Amazing view. We took the room with the jacuzzi and everyday is a pleasure to wake up and to enjoy the breakfast with the view of the caldera. The team did everything to make sure our trip went smoothly. From the different towel decoration on the bed each day, different gifts in the afternoon from chocolate to lip balm to the complimentary happy hours during sunset; everything was provided to make our trip the best. I can only highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back here the next time I plan a trip to Santorini.",1
"Stayed in the White Suite and this is fantastic, nothing can be faulted at this hotel. Nothing is to much trouble for the owners and staff, the cocktail hour and little presents throughout the day are a great bonuses. If you want to get recommendations on hotels and bookings no trouble. We had a great holiday here and have no issue in rating this hotel at the top end of places to stay.",1
"We went to Santorini again after 2 years, and stayed at Artemis Villas again. The same as the last two times, really good service, extremely friendly staff, generous owners, of course the sunset view is unbeatable. Will definitely go back again Angela and Chris, wish to see you in Hong Kong.",1
"The Artemis Villas was recommended to us for our 20th Wedding Anniversary by my sister-in-law. I have not reviewed a property on trip advisor before but ARTEMIS VILLAS truly deserves a recommendation. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, with a late night arrival Angela kindly had a lovely Greek salad, some wine & desert waiting for us, complimentary, very gratefully received after our travels. The next morning we woke to a beautiful champagne breakfast served on our balcony for our anniversary….. and we were already relaxed. The view from our balcony was stunning from morning to night, 24/7 you could never tire of it. The Jacuzzi on our balcony was pure heaven. The sunsets were truly amazing with the added bonus of complimentary cocktails.You could not fault the service, what a great team Angle and Chris have working for them. Gazi, Eddie and Julietta could not do enough for you. (and I hate to miss out the shy young lady with no name that couldn’t speak English but would always offer a gleaming smile) Every very long day they worked they smiled all day, (even after walking up and down those stairs 100 times) they couldn’t do enough for you and were on hand at a moment’s notice should you need anything.Small gifts and treats every day made you feel that bit extra special. Our room was spotlessly cleaned every day and Julietta’s artistic towel creations were brilliant and we were excited every day to see what she had created. This is truly a beautiful couple’s place to stay and I definitely hope to return.One comment I would like to highlight, having visited Oia for the morning I question why anyone staying here would want to visit Oia for the sunset, crushed in between crowds and crowds of people, when you can sit in the lovely tranquil setting of Artemis Villas and watch an amazing sunset over Oia with a cocktail in your hand even from your hot tub if you so wish….. Pure Heaven.",2
"Great location, the warmest hosts one could ask for & beautiful rooms with special touches on a daily basis. Book it! and be sure to book a room with a jacuzzi on the terrace. Trip was over far too quickly.",0
"Everything about this place is fantastic.It is owned by an Australian guy named Chris with his wife Angela. They were both really friendly and helpful.The views from the villas are amazing with beautiful sunset views.They are in a great location overlooking the Caldera and in the evenings with other properties lit up it is magical.Lovely staff , spotlessly clean rooms ,and a great pool to cool off in after a day taking in the sights.They offer free cocktails to watch the sunset and throughout the day offer free little gifts and treats which is a lovely touch. There is a snack menu which offer fantastic salads and a small range of meals which always came beautifully presented which you can have delivered to your balcony or the pool area.....Quite a feat for the staff to carry up the many steps but always delivered with a friendly smile !We were travelling around the Greek islands for a few weeks and decided to go back to Santorini for a few nights before our return home. We thought to visit a different area and booked to stay in Oia....How we wished we had gone back to Artemis villas...We had a beautiful villa and the town was lovely to visit but it lacked the personal touches that Chris and his staff provided.Don,t waste time looking at other properties ..Do yourself a favour and book into Artemis villas ..You won,t be disappointed.Thank you Chris, Angela and all your staff....We will definitely be back in the near future.Chris &Cher   Room Tip: All rooms are amazing with stunning views See more room tips",3
This hotel is run by a man named Chris who is super helpful and friendly. The rooms are pretty large as far as cave rooms go with amazing views of the Aegean and sunset. They offer complimentary happy hour drinks delivered to your room which was a nice touch. Great location in Imerovigli and fairly priced rooms.,0
"We were collected at the airport by the driver Angela and Chris arranged for us. They had a car seat for our baby girl as requested. Once we arrived at the villas Gazi took our luggage to our room with a gorgeous view where a baby bed had been set up. This made our first trip with our baby so much easier knowing that we were being looked after. Chris greeted us with a delicious dessert, dinner recommendations and order for happy hour. The pampering continued until we left-breakfast was yummy, restaurant recommendations were fantastic, drivers with car seats were arranged quickly and Gazi and Eddie were on hand to help with anything we needed.The view is amazing, the cocktails matched. We reserved the hot tub by the pool one night for sunset- highly recommend it as it is so peaceful up there.I would definitely recommend staying here with kids (or without)",0
"We stayed more than 1 week and enjoyed fantastic vacation in a Junior Suite. The view was gorgeous. During the day you can have a look down to the Cruise Ships or to Skaros rock. The highlight is of course the sunset you enjoy from your room.Angela, Chris and the Team do a great job in serving their guests. We highly appreciated the amenities such as fruits or ice cream at the pool, coffee and cake in the afternoon and very good cocktails at happy hour time. Short distance walks to very good restaurants, supermarkets or car rental services.   Room Tip: Junior Suite See more room tips",1
"Pros- we arrived into Santorini at around 11pm and were greeted with freshly made Greek salads (possibly the best we had during our entire stay in Greece) and wine. All complementary and very much appreciated after our long trip- the view is spectacular, we looked directly down on the caldera with our own balcony. I can't think of a better place to enjoy the caldera, you really are in the best spot (better than anywhere in Fira and Oia)- Breakfast was served to us on our balcony every day, recommend the American breakfast (omelette was delicious)- free cocktails and desserts every afternoon - both really tasty- rooftop pool with great views- we also stayed at a posh hotel in Fira for double the price and was such a disappointment compared to Artemis. We wished we stayed here for our entire stay. We can't emphasis enough how amazing the view is noting the price we paid- service was excellent, every request we had they went out of their way to meetCons- really can't think of any, only minor point was they made one bad recommendation for a restaurant (directed us to a French restaurant when we asked for a Greek dinner)",1
"Ahhh... What a beautiful island, beautiful property, and phenomenal people that give 5-star service. We were on our honeymoon and once we arrived we realized we were on a romantic island in absolute paradise. This part of Santorini, Imerogivli area, is at one of the highest points of the island and this property overlooks the caldera but more importantly has the BEST sunset views (Many people think Oia does but this part of Imerogivli provides the BEST). We stayed in the White suite which was a beautiful suite inside of the original cave. The property owners Chris & Angela along with their staff: Eddie, Gazi and Juliette, are simply AMAZING!!!! Every recommendation to restaurants and activities to do, every piece of service, and anything you needed could be had by this family owned property and the customer service they provided. They are just good people who cater to their guest in a high quality ""boutique"" atmosphere in an ""old"" world charm. We enjoyed our stay. As must do while in Imerogivli is to walk the 2.5 hour path through the mountains to the end of Oia and walk down the stairs to eat at Katina's, Amoudi Bay. Simply stunning.... Additionally, I think one should be prepared to be in modest wellness shape because this area is a lot of walking and stair climbing. We loved the fitness component of it but travelers should understand. If we are ever back in Santorini, Artemis Villas owned by Chris & Angela is our place.",1
"My husband and I just stayed here for 3 nights. I wish we could have stayed longer.We honestly found it hard to fault much there. They organised transfers from the airport for us in the evening of our arrival, gave us a welcome drink each, and we had lovely little treats on the bed. The view was spectacular every day, all day! Free happy hour drinks for an hour between 7pm and 8pm as you enjoy the sunset. A turn down service each evening with a little gift each day. Fresh fruit platter on our first day.So many wonderful touches that I can't list them all. The staff were so lovely and always willing to go the extra mile. A big shout out to Chris who was so helpful and friendly. Also a big thanks to the lovey Eddie who served our happy hour drinks, always with a smile and a friendly chat. We didn't have a room with a jacuzzi and still loved it all the same. You can't go wrong with any rooms. The pool and jacuzzi on the roof gives off the most spectacular views, especially at sunset. For those with no jacuzzis on your balcony, you get preference if you want to book the jacuzzi for your private use one evening. Only down side was that the jacuzzi was playing up a little. It would only run for 10 or so minutes, then need a 20-30 min rest before it would work again. That being said, it was still a lovely spot to have our happy hour drink and enjoy the sunset. The staff provided free water if you were going on a hike i.e. To Oia from the hotel, and gave suggestions for meals etc. The only thing that may make some people hesitant is that they currently don't have an online booking system working. This means that they request your credit card details over email. My husband was a bit uncomfortable with doing this and we almost didn't book with Artemis Villas initially because of this. We worked out an alternative arrangement using phone and email, but having an online booking system working would probably be beneficial. Just a slight thing, but not a hassle in comparison to the wonderful stay that we had. Don't bother going to Oia for the ""famous"" sunset, it's just as beautiful, if not, more beautiful from your balcony at Artemis Villas. Thank you all again!",2
Our love affair with Santorini has only just begun with thanks to the Artemis Villas. We cannot recommend this hotel enough from the second we arrived the 5* treatment was overwhelming. Angela and Chris and staff Eddie and Gazi are just the kindest people you can meet. They make u feel like royalty. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff come with little surprises throughout the day which makes the experience very special. The most spectacular part of our stay was the sunset....its just magical!!!! Time stood still....with ur free happy hour cocktail in all honesty hand on heart the sunset and surroundings have healed a broken spirit i had before arriving....so believe me it really is a magical place Everyone deserves to stay here at some point in their life and we are already planning to return next year.,3
"We have just stayed at Artemis villas for a 3rd time as we have just had our wedding in Santorini! Angela & chris and their small team once again were amazing they just can't do enough for you during your stay. I have been to many 5* hotels around the world and have never had service and hospitality that can match that of Artemis villas, due to the size of the hotel they can truly offer a personal touch. Thank you for making our wedding day special!Ps. The two nerve settlers did the trick : )Many thanks A&H",4
"We stayed here for about 4 days in early May, 2016. At the outset, its important to know that online booking was not available at the time of writing and you'll need to coordinate directly with the hotel to book a room. However, the hotel was quick, efficient and transparent about their rates. From the time we landed and were met by the hotel staff, we felt cared for. The staff were at all times, friendly, helpful and warm. One of the staff also gave us good tips for finding a good spot to go cliff diving at Amoudi Bay! The room itself was neat, comfortable and warm, and lacked no amenities, though a little small. We had a beautiful view of Skaros rock and of the Caldera itself. The hotel is well-siutated in Imerovigli with good access to all parts of Santorini.The high-point of our stay was the jacuzzis. You can book a room with a built-in jacuzzi or book the public jacuzzi for an evening. We chose the latter. All the jacuzzis are perfectly situated to enjoy the view of the caldera and the sunset and we loved that we could relax in the comfort of the jacuzzis and watch the spectacular beauty of a Santorini sunset. The fact that Artemis has a happy hour with unlimited free drinks that more or less coincides with the sunset is just the massive dollop of icing on top of the experience!A final note, on the thoughtful little details. The staff at Artemis always cleaned our rooms thoughtfully and efficiently, and always left behind a little gift (a sweet, a bookmark, a postcard on our last day) after doing so. And they have a wonderful habit of dropping off desserts at random times to whoever is interested in having one. So, all in all, a wonderful experience which I could not recommend highly enough.   Room Tip: Rooms situated higher up have better road access and privacy. See more room tips",4
We stayed at the Artemis Villas for 2 nights. Service is excellent - Angela and her team are truly at your beck and call - bringing treats to eat and drink without ever asking! 5 star service in a 5 star location. This hotel has unobstructed sunset views year round. Very popular with honemooners.,3
"Really, there are no words for how much our family loved Artemis Villas! From the moment we stepped off the plane and were met by our driver until we left, 6 days later, were just perfection. Chris & Angela and all the staff, Juliette, Sonia, Eddie & Gazi were incredible from start to finish! They took care of every detail and pampered us in every way. Our Suite for 4 was HUGE! Two separate bedrooms & bathrooms (one was large with a hot tub) and dining/living room with kitchenette and two separate entrances (which our teenagers loved). A very private lower deck with seating and jacuzzi with sunset view and separate, private, upper deck with table & chairs with an awesome, uninterrupted view of the caldera!! They delivered our full American breakfast here every morning. Every afternoon complimentary treats & drinks as well as happy hour drinks while watching the sunset. By the pool, complimentary ice cream and lemonade. We arrived ""home"" each day to special treats of some sort. It was truly a beautiful experience for our family! It's prime real estate nestled between some of the bigger, extremely expensive hotels with the personal touch that makes all the difference! It doesn't get better than this...just book it, you'll be happy you did!   Room Tip: For families, the Suite for 4... 2 large beds and 3 day beds in the living room, could potentially s...

"Santorini is breathtaking from their villas and this stop on our honeymoon (in June 2013) was absolutely perfect. I would go back in a heart beat. Staff was extremely attentive to detail and helpful. Food and drinks were delicious. Each night if you're there at sunset they bring you a ""treat"" to enjoy during it. The room we had was stunning and even had a hot tub. Every morning we'd eat breakfast off the patio, which was wonderful.",2
"This review is a tad late as my now fiance and I stayed at Artemis last July for a week. Similar to every other review the rooms were amazing and the staff were absolutely incredible. Out of all the places we have stayed and will stay on vacations I find it hard to believe that we will ever experience the same level of customer service that we did with Chris, Angela and the rest of their staff. There are multiple area's where this proves true but I'll focus on only a few...First we arrived at 3 am to be greeted by a member of their staff who carried our bags (those we had on us, more to come on this) down to our room and gave us a swift run through on the amenities so we could crash. The next morning we woke up to a great breakfast, as with every day, despite not being able to order the day before.The bag situation - we tried to save some $$ on flights so flew Vueling who are notorious for losing bags. I have never lost a bag prior to this but Veuling stood strong by their reputation losing both our checked bags. Chris and Angela were absolutely incredible with this calling the airport to help locate them. Chris actually went to the airport multiple times to address the issue in person and after 4 days we came back to our room to find our bags there. It was incredible how much effort they put into helping us with the situation, I would be hard pressed to find any other hotel owners that would do the same. Finally I was planning on proposing to the love of my life which of course Angela and Chris helped make it even more memorable. I told them my plan and without hesitation they were on board. After I popped the question we came back to our room to find that they had scattered rose pedals, set up multiple candles and had a bottle of champagne waiting for us to toast to the engagement. Funny enough fireworks starting going off right over our heads which we credited to them as well even though they let us know it was from a wedding next store :-)We have recommended Artemis to anyone we know making the trip to Santorini and would not hesitate to stay there again. Beyond the incredible staff the rooms themselves are great with a phenomenal view of the sunset night after night.",5
"The owners and the staff of this little gem were wonderful and extremely helpful The large room, built into the mountainside, hangs over the pathway along the Aegean sea. Great sunsets! Be prepared to climb steps to get to your room, Santorini is a vertical place.",4
"When I went to Artemis Villas, I had my birthday! The day before my birthday they gave me a blue owl which I called Tim. I thought it was very nice of them to give me a present. At dinner I found out that they arranged a cake for me! It was a delicious cake. When I got back from the restaurant, I went into the room and to my amazement there was sequins and balloons everywhere. But there it was, another present and also a cake made out of towels! That was the best holiday ever! Thank you very much Chris and Angela! You made my day ever so special! x",5
"This was our second trip, the first being two years ago. Again Chris and Angela make fantastic hosts and nothing is too much trouble for them and their team. There were 12 of us and it was the last week of the season but we were looked after superbly. The rooms are nicely laid out. There is a fridge, coffee machine etc and there are plenty of places to eat locally. The views are fantastic especially while sitting in the hot tub with a glass of wine\beer! I'm already looking forward to another visit next year! You wont be disappointed.",5
"We booked a villa which was recommended to us by friends who couldn't praise the villas enough and we can see why, from the moment we arrived in Santorini the owners and staff could not have done more to make our stay as memorable and relaxing as possible. They arranged transport from the airport and as we were arriving late had meals prepared and set out on the balcony when we arrived. Our villa was spacious, clean and immaculately presented with stunning views over the caldera from the balcony and jacuzzi. The villas are well positioned for shops, restaurants and transportation while remaining quiet and peaceful. All the villas have facilities for filter coffee, kettles, well equipped kitchens everything you could possibly want, If you needed anything it was only a phone call away. Breakfast was delivered when you requested it and was both beautiful and plentiful a fantastic start to the day. In the evenings we had complimentary cocktails brought to our room or balcony with gifts from the island and the next days weather report.The villas were fabulous, the scenery was spectacular but the highlight of this all too short break were the staff who were brilliant, friendly and helpful they made our stay truly memorable, nothing was to much trouble for them taking care to go that extra yard to make our stay as pleasurable and relaxing as they could,An extra special mention for the owners Chris and Angela, not only because they arranged everything we wanted, whether it was restaurant bookings or transportation but especially because when they found out it was our sons birthday they arranged with the restaurant we ate at that night to get a cake for him and when returning to our villa found that they had filled the room with balloons and decorations and a present from them both.All in all it was a fabulous break and we are all looking forward to returning in the future.",2
This was recommended to us through friends. The most amazing set up. Each individual room has catering facilities if you want to use it or breakfast can be brought each day to your terrace. Clean and all needs catered for. You wouldn't be disappointed. The staff are amazingly friendly but still very professional.   Room Tip: First floor roo room See more room tips,1
"This place was perfect for it's location, cleanliness, room sizes, hospitality, amenities, view, AND price! Also, there is a FABULOUS restaurant, overlooking the sea, just a 5 minute walk down the road! We would have LOVED to stay a week or more but sadly, we only had one night due to my father's ill health. Blessings to Danasis Artemios and wonderful Anna and all guests who visit them!

"This is a late review.Stayed at this beautiful hotel for our honeymoon. This place is not only excellent for its spectacular views but also the amazing hospitality extended to us by the hotel staff. They spoiled us with the happy hour in evening, small gifts/souvenirs distributed door to door and view beautiful, rosy sunset that can be viewed while you are in outdoor Jacuzzi relaxing.They were really helpful with information such as suggesting itineraries, best wineries around the town and places to eat   Room Tip: Book through the hotel website directly to get best rates See more room tips",1
"My husband and I stayed 4 nights at Artemis Villas. From the initial inquiry through our stay, Angela was super responsive. We booked a junior suite with an outdoor jacuzzi. The room itself was a nice size with a beautiful bathroom but who even cares about the inside because it is ALL about the view. The balcony was the perfect place to sit and have breakfast, lounge with a book, etc... and just stare at the water. The rooftop pool also has plenty of space for lounging and also has a gorgeous view. Angela and Chris were amazing throughout our stay. They helped arrange transportation to and from the port/airport, make restaurant recommendations and reservations, arrange a boat tour, wine tour, you name it. You can tell they love helping guests and being a host. I celebrated my 30th birthday on our second day and they brought me cake with breakfast. It was so thoughtful and adorable.We were walking distance to some great restaurants (Mezzo, La Maison, Anogi, etc...) but it was quite a hike to Fira. A pretty hike, but a far one. Imerovigli is definitely a quiet area, those in search of nightlife will be bored. Minor annoyances:Our room (#124) was at the top of the hotel. It probably had the best views, but at around 7am every morning we could hear the staff yelling back and forth, getting something (the chairs?) set up on the rooftop pool above us, etc... We did not have much privacy at all on our balcony. There was just a half wall between the balconies. We could hear and see everything. Some of the rooms have more private balconies, but are more visible from rooms above or from the path that runs below.   Room Tip: Rooms at the top have the best views. See more room tips",1
"We stayed a week in the white suite and it was perfect from beginning to end. So many little touches that go beyond normal service that make you feel like a truly valued guest. The cohesive team lead by Chris and Angela deliver everything with a smile from the delicious breakfasts to the complimentary sunset cocktails. Our room was spotless, comfortable with fantastic views. Each day we returned to find fresh fruit and bottled water. When we wanted to travel a little out of town to a taverna Chris arranged transport. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. There cannot possibly be a better place to stay on Santorini.   Room Tip: All rooms have spectacular views white suite was large and luxurious. See more room tips",1
"Having just come back from a five day stay at the Artemis Villa I can only praise Chris and his dedicated dream team, Eddy, Gasi, Sonia and Julietta. Airport transfers were in place so upon arrival we were greeted by Chris and a complementary G&T, nice touch. Having only had 90 minutes sleep the evening before, a few Mythos later and a dip in the zucuzi left us fit for nothing. The rooms are perfect and the views are breathtakingly beautiful. Chris arranged a reservation at Avocado Restaurant, which was perfect. Our second day comprised of some overcast and showery weather which was perfect to explore Fira, by 3pm the sun was out. Chris again booked a great restaurant in Oia, Ochre, the sunset and ambiance were incredible. Chris also booked a boat trip and wine tasting tour, which again was fantastic. Therefore, I cannot recommend this place enough. If you want to rest, relax and be completely spoilt then this is the place for you. The breakfasts are fit for Royalty, mid-morning a complementary ice cream comes around. The salads are super tasty and a more than generous portion is served. Tatziki and Pitta, delicious. Mid-afternoon comes a complementary iced-coffee and then later for sun set and complementary cocktails or glass of wine/beer...needless to say I will be returning, that's not a threat, that's a promise. So thanks again Chris et al for a sublime stay, you guys truly are legendary x Much love Clare x   Room Tip: 120 - perfect x See more room tips",1
"My husband and I stayed in Artemis Villas for 4 nights. The location is perfect -- with stunning caldera view and near to bus stop. There are a view restaurants and small shops nearby. My room (junior suite with outdoor jacuzzi) is of a reasonable size, and is clean. Service is the best -- staff members are very friendly and are ready to help. They serve free cocktails during happy hour. Breakfast is of huge portion and the quality is good.",0
"We booked online for Oia and were bitterly disappointed when we arrived at our accommodation on the beachside of the island - it was very rural and nothing like the pictures portrayed online. We stayed two nights of the booking for five and decided to move and forfeit out money. I walked the strip along Imerovigli, up and down stairs looking for a vacancy after reading this was a very good area of the island to stay. After about an hour I followed a set of stairs a long way down and saw a very small sign above a door - 'Reception - Artemis Villas'. We have been here three nights and have changed our Athens booking to stay three more nights. Having been in the hospitality industry over 45 years I have become very aware of how important every aspect of a guests stay is to make it memorable. We will remember forever our stay at Artemis Villas - absolutely wonderful. Thankyou Chris and your staff for the the experience and the memories.   Room Tip: There are ten villas and they all have superb views with private balconies. See more room tips",0
This place is absolutely beatiful. All staff members are efficient and very kind. Chris and Angela were always ready for any advice. The views from the balcony are just awesome and the sunset is magnificient. With no doubt I recommend Artemis Villas as one of the best places in Imerovigli.,0
"From start to finish we had the most wonderful stay at Artemis Villas. When our flight schedule changed and didn't get in until about midnight, the hotel still had a van ready to pick us up and a member of the staff there to carry our bags down the steps and show us to our room. As if that wasn't enough, the left Greek salads and a carafe of wine, thinking we'd be hungry from all of our travels. We were and enjoyed a very late al fresco snack and wine on our terrace. It was so fresh and so hospitable. It really started our trip on a nice note. Our room, the honeymoon suite, was very clean and comfortable and we appreciated the complimentary water bottles and fruit. Not something we received at other places we stayed. The hotel also had celebratory champagne and flower petals waiting for us the next night. They really just went above and beyond, plus were very helpful with questions and reservation requests. To top it all off, the view from our room was stunning and the perfect place to watch sunset sans crowds. I can only hope to go back one day and will recommend the hotel to all my friends traveling to Santorini.",0
"Just returned from a week at Arttemis villas! All the comments you read on previous reviews are true! Angela, Chris and all the staff here are so polite and helpful! Fantastic hospitality! The view is stunning! We sat on our balcony or by the pool for hours, taking it all in! The weather was fabulous! Loved the walk to Fira! Caught the local bus to Oia, Kamari and Perrisa and experienced an amazing day on a boat trip around the Caldera! Thank you to all at the Artemis for making our holiday so special! Hope we can come back soon!   Room Tip: Lots of steps so if your not very mobile ask for a room higher up! Sitting in your jacuzzi watching... See more room tips",0
"I did extensive research on where to stay in Santorini and Artemis Villas did not disappoint. Everything about Artemis is on point. The view, the rooms, the service...It was the perfect mix of authentic Greek charm and luxury. If possible splurge on a room with an outdoor hot tub. After exploring Santorini during the day, coming back to Artemis and watching the sunset from our private hot tub was out of this world and one of my fondest memories of the entire trip.",2
"This place was absolutely beautiful in every way! All staff were so nice and always greeted you. Chris and Angela were always on hand for any advice during the day. We were pampered so much with free drinks, ice creams and little chocolates at night from the staff. You won't receive this sort of service at any other hotel. They look after you here and are reasonably priced compared to a lot of other places. We ate breakfast at the hotel for 2 of the 3 mornings. Unfortunately the 3rd morning we had to leave early to go to the airport, so missed out. The breakfast is the freshest you will find on the island I reckon. Plus is reasonably priced. To be honest, staying here, you won't need to leave your villa. The views were just awesome. We went to oia one night for the sunset, just to say we did it. There is honestly no need to. Just enjoy it from your balcony.. Its the exact same thing, but in comfort..and you can see it from your spa (if you have one). We were lucky enough to be on the island for a special ceremony they do once every year for the volcano with fireworks. Angela, Chris and staff cooked up a complimentary feast for dinner. It's was so awesome! I wish I stayed in the villa more and didn't go exploring, as I would have been able to Tey more of the food on their menu. They are all very reasonably priced and looked delicious from what I could see. Next time I come to Santorini, I won't be staying anywhere else!",2
"My husband and I came to Artemis for 7 nights of our Honeymoon and are so happy that we chose to stay here. The service from everyone was second to none! Angela and Chris were so accommodating including helping us book a fantastic boat trip and arranging a late check out room for us as our flight home was late in the evening. The welcome they gave us was exemplary! They are such nice people and nothing is too much trouble. Thank you also to Gazi and Eddie for looking after us so well! We were waited on hand and foot. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. On arrival we were treated to a lovely jug of wine followed by a celebratory bottle of fizz, card and a cake for our honeymoon. All week we were given sunset cocktails, ice creams, water, iced coffees and treats. We really felt spoilt!The breakfasts are huge and really good. Even if you don't order a breakfast, you still get a coffee and cake served to your balcony before 12. We had lunch a couple of times too which was lovely. Huge salads that were delicious and fresh and very reasonably priced. The rooms are lovely, well equipped and with great bathrooms and fridges. The view from the balcony is completely breathtaking and added to with the lovely hot tub that we had for the week of our stay. Perfect with the complimentary cocktail before getting ready for dinner. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and will definitely return. Thank you Chris and Angela for making our honeymoon so special!",0
"We booked Artemis Villas on the strength of its previous reviews and found these positive comments more than justified, Chris, Angela and their staff looked after us very well, they were always attentive but never intrusive. The Caldera view from Artemis Villas is fantastic but the obvious appeal of this view has led to dense 'jenga' like development of low rise accommodation built into and onto the steep slope, which means that there is limited privacy on the many terraces. The best response to this is to just relax and enjoy the view like everyone else. Artemis is probably upper mid market in comparison with the other accommodation on the Caldera facing slope at Imerovigli, however we thought that the service and position of Artemis would be hard to beat even if you did spend much more.Good points:+ Very helpful with booking and transfer arrangements+ Fantastic service from all the staff, they are a really nice bunch of people+ Fantastic 180 degree view of the Caldera (and of the rest of the island from the centre of Imerovigli, as it is one of the highest points on the island)+ Really tasty breakfasts (available up to midday), salads (available from midday to 8pm), and a good range of drinks, all at very reasonable prices+ Fuss free transfers to and from the airport (around 20 minutes each way)+ Much appreciated free cocktails between 7pm and 8pm+ Several good restaurants within a 15 minute walk (although there are lots of steps whichever route you take from the hillside accommodation in Imerovigli)+ Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee machines and capsules in the roomsNot so good points:- Most guests book for 2-4 nights as part of island hopping itineraries, so availability for longer / whole week stays is very limited (we had tried to book a week here in 2014 but there was no availability, even this year availability for a 7 night stay was very limited)- There is not much to do in the immediate area, so ideal if you just want to relax and enjoy the view (there are wine tasting trips and so on if you don't mind travelling away from Imerovigli)- Due to the steep slopes and large numbers of steps, Imerovigli as a whole is unsuitable for the less able, less mobile or even those with vertigo, (although it may be possible to find somewhere slightly more accessible at the very top of the cliff)   Room Tip: Each room is quite different, some have two terraces while others have private jacuzzis on their ter... See more room tips",2
"We had a lovely 7 night stay at Artemis in a junior suite with a jacuzzi overlooking the caldera. The staff (particularly Eddie) were extremely attentive and couldn't have done any more to help us to enjoy our stay. The view from our balcony was amazing and we enjoyed numerous sunsets accompanied by our complimentary happy hour cocktails! We thought the location was great - the right balance of having access to the hustle and bustle of Fira and not being overrun with tourists during the day. It's worth noting that the food, in particular the breakfasts, was well worth getting. We hope to be back!",1
"Wow what a view!!! Awesome and only place to stay . Friendly, happy staff who want to please and I can not say enough wonderful things. This is definitely the most romantic place to stay. The one complaint which is everywhere are the steps. Each room had its own design very nice.",1
"August 2015 - We booked one of the larger suite, 2 separate bedrooms, for our family of 5. One person had to sleep on one of the 2 day bed in the kitchen which was no issue.All week we got pampered by the friendly staff who brought us cold water, ice creams and cocktails for 7:00pm. The pictures are accurate to what you get, the view is splendid and weather was +31C sunny all week. I found Imerovigli well located on the island and an easy drive everywhere, to the beaches, to go to Oia or Fiera. We got discouraged by the buses as they were often late and already full. Altas Rental give us great service and problem free. This town has also a nice little bakery just a short walk away (about 2 pastries). I would definitely recommand this place for a quiet romantic getaway which was not our case, our family had plenty of room to roam around and Chris and Angela were particularly accommodating for some other members of our family who regretted not renting there.Location, accommodations and staff are all A+. They also pick up from the airport in a nice a/c van.The view was priceless all day, we didnt want to go anywhere else.",1
"We had a perfect stay at Artemis Villas for our honeymoon. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and you could tell they were focused on helping their clients have the best trip possible. The views over the Aegean were absolutely stunning from all locations on the property, it would be hard to find better views on the island. Imerovigli was a perfect town to stay in for a quiet, relaxed vacation, without the craziness you find in Fira and Oia. We had a fabulous trip to Santorini due in large part to the wonderful staff at Artemis Villas ~ we would highly recommend!",1
"Being Greek myself, my standards are quite high when it comes to Greek islands. This hotel lives up to my expectations every time I visit! The food is excellent as well. Don't forget to order a cocktail and just relax watching the sunset. It's heaven on earth! :)",1
"Stayed for 10 nights in a superior suite with outdoor jacuzzi. My husband, teenage daughter and I were completely spoiled by the most wonderful staff for our duration. Gazi Eddie Julietta and Sonya couldn't do enough to make our holiday special. Particular mention must be made to the sundowner cocktails, the towel modelling , the iced coffees and the smoothies, ice creams other treats served to you by the pool. Chris and Angela were lovely and were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and bookings etcWe ate breakfast on our balcony most mornings. Again the quality of the food and service was outstanding. It was my husbands birthday whilst we were there. We had a mid morning knock on our door, opened up to the fantastic view over the caldera and there were the staff with big smiles, birthday greetings and a huge chocolate cake and bottle of champagne! This short review just doesn't do justice to the experience that the hotel provides you with. I would strongly recommend you book and see for yourselves.",1
We spent 3 nights at Artemis Villas and enjoyed the most fantastic service. Angela and Chris made us feel so at home in their beautiful establishment. It has amazing views of the caldera and the sunsets are truly spectacular. I would recommend this for couples looking for a romantic spot on the island.,1
My boyfriend and I stayed at Artemis Villas for four nights. We had the most incredible time. The views are simply outstanding and the service was really very good. The owners Chris and Angela were very nice and helpful. I was unwell for a part of the trip and they were very understanding and asked after me each day which really added to the overall experience. The staff were excellent and we loved the 7pm knock on our door for happy hour. Our room was large and clean. The balcony and hot tub was the highlight of our trip. We spent several days having beers and watching the sun set in awe. Highly recommend the location and this hotel!We will be back!,1
My mum and I stayed at the Artemis Villas for a few nights and loved the service here not to mention the amazing location with breathtaking views. The owners Chris and Angela are so friendly and helpful. The staff are also very friendly. We loved our stay and would recommend to friends and family.,1
"We have been to some amazing places before but have never experienced something so fantastic. No request was too big for this place and the service was simply wonderful. The amazing suites, caldera views, free sunset cocktails combined with Chris' top tier service will make Artemis an unforgettable experience.",2
"After researching many hotels on TripAdvisor we decided to book at Artemis Villas for our 8 days in Santorini for our honeymoon. This was one of the best decisions we made in regards to our trip. Artemis Villas is in Imerovigli which is much quieter than some of the other towns, but a short (20-30 minute) walk into the town of Fira. We stayed in a Junior Suite (room 113) that had a private hot tub and was up toward the top of the hotel so we had a bit more privacy. The only downfall to that room was that we couldn't see the sunset from our hot tub, but we could still see it from the balcony every night. The staff at Artemis was AMAZING and always checking to see if we needed anything. Plus they served free drinks during happy hour every night. You really can't beat everything that Artemis has to offer!",1
"The view is amazing and the hotel is really quiet, no tourist playing around ! I think this is the best part of the caldera to settle down. Do not hesitate to order food, the price is really correct (really cheaper than a sea view restaurant) and moreover you will get diner on your own private terrace with the most amazing view of .the caldera Enjoy !",1
"Santorini isn't a place where you should skimp on the accommodation purely because it is part of the experience. Artemis Villas certainly was no slouch when it came to that. The rooms were unique, comfortable and clean. It was pragmatic/modern where it needed to be but traditional and exotic everywhere else. I cannot tell you enough what an amazing view this hotel gifted us and I am grateful. I am also in awe of the peace and quiet that came along with it. Further, the service was absolutely great and I have to give a special thank you to Chris and his crew (and yes, each and everyone one of them was fantastic) because of their impeccable service and all-round friendliness. Make sure you get their breakfast and enjoy it with that view!",1
"Artemis Villas is located at the highest peak of Santorini in a town called Imerovigli. Imerovigli is a quiet town, with a few restaurants and stores. Getting around Santorini is extremely easy. You can walk to Fira from the hotel, or take the bus. The bus system is extremely easy to navigate. We were able to quickly and easily get to Fira, Firostefani, Oia, Akrotiri, etc.The Artemis Villas are built in traditional Cycladic style overlooking the Caldera. The views from Artemis Villas are truly breathtaking.We stayed in a Junior Suite with Outdoor Jacuzzi with an unobstructed view of the caldera. BREATHTAKING! Our Suite was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.As for the service, this is where Artemis Villas really shines. Angela, Chris, and their entire staff Eddie, Sonia and Gazi are dedicated to making ones stay truly amazing.Each night the staff came to our room to offer us free cocktails while we watched the sunset. Weather cards and tokens of love, such as chocolates and soaps were left in our room each night. On the days we spent sitting by the pool the staff would bring us fruit, ice cream and water at no charge. It's these special touches that make the difference.All this to say that it was a true struggle to pack our bags and leave at the end of our stay.There is a saying: ""People you meet define the country you visit"". The staff at Artemis Villas have certainly defined Santorini for us.Until we meet again!",1
"We have just returned after staying at Artemis Villas for 9 nights, in a Junior Suite (room 113). When we booked, I requested a room with a fairly private balcony if possible, and the hotel did not disappoint. When you visit Santorini, you realise that privacy is very difficult to come by because of the way the towns and villages are laid out. Many balconies, particularly those lower down the cliffside, are very overlooked, however our room was on the highest floor and in a corner position. We had our own private jacuzzi, as well as a table, chairs and two deck chairs.The room itself was clean, spacious and had everything we needed, including a powerful shower, small kitchenette (complete with Nespresso machine that was replenished daily), decent air conditioning and a comfortable bed. Wi-Fi was generally OK. Fresh towels, water and other little treats were left for us everyday - you could always ask for more too. We ate breakfast on the balcony almost every morning - omelettes or boiled eggs, with fresh fruit, greek yoghurt, delicious bread and cake, and orange juice, tea and coffee. We've never experienced a breakfast like that anywhere else in the world!There's also a small pool area with around 12 sun loungers. We visited in 'high season' and never once saw this area get full at any time of the day. The pool is quite small but perfect for cooling down, and the jacuzzi has a great view of the caldera. You can get drinks and snacks sent up to the pool area whenever you want - on one occasion we ordered two cocktails, and they sent six up for everybody who was sat around the pool, completely free of charge.All the staff here are truly wonderful - professional, courteous and so helpful. Upon arriving, Gazi met us to carry our luggage down the steps, and Chris offered us a free welcome drink. Angela and Chris were great throughout, always happy to recommend places to go and how to get there. They arranged our transfers to/from the airport, and a taxi for us to visit Perissa beach. They also told us how to use the bus, and offered to get somebody to walk with us to the bus stop. One of the highlights of our holiday was the sunset boat trip, which Angela kindly arranged for us - they think of the smallest details here - she even checked the weather to recommend a day when the sea would be calmest!Everybody else was brilliant too, always said 'hello' with a smile, and nothing was ever too much trouble. Little touches, such as when we had just returned from walking up and down Skaros Rock, Gazi brought us both ice cold bottles of water without us even asking! We also loved the 'towel art' that was waiting in our room for us every afternoon!This hotel is also in a fantastic location. It is set back from the main pathway between Fira and Oia, making it more private than many other hotels, where the balconies often seem to sit directly on the pathway. It's around a 15 minute walk to Firostefani, around 45 minutes to Fira, and couple of hours to Oia (although we didn't do this walk as it was too hot). It is also just a short walk away from some excellent restaurants (we'd highly recommend Mezzo, Anogi and Avocado), as well as a few small supermarkets, car hire companies and the bus stop to take you to Fira or Oia. The flashlight included with your room key certainly comes in handy during the evenings, you definitely need to watch your step and be prepared to climb up and down some very steep, cobbled stairs.Finally, this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the magical Santorini sunset! The view from Imerovigli is simply so breathtaking that we didn't feel the need to battle with the crowds in Oia. Apart from one night when we watched the sunset during our boat trip, we watched it from our balcony every night, with a happy hour cocktail. The choice of drinks and cocktails is great, and on a couple of occasions we were offered more than one!If you're looking for a bit of everything in Santorini, we would highly recommend Artemis Villas and we hope to return as soon as we can. Imerovigli is a quiet and peaceful location, but close enough to more nightlife and tourist spots. The sunset from here is stunning, while the staff really make this place special. Thank you to everyone here for a truly memorable stay.   Room Tip: Higher rooms offer a bit more privacy. Room 113 was very private. See more room tips",4
"I have just returned home from Santorini after spending an incredible five nights at Artemis Villas in the lead-up to my wedding on the island. Having stayed here previously in July 2012 - and loving the experience immensely - I was very hopeful that it would be able to live up to my (high) expectations. And boy did it deliver. We had the most incredible stay here, and were joined by my parents and brother, who also rated it as one of their favourite hotels in Europe. Chris, the hotel owner, provided us with exceptional customer service and nothing we asked for during our stay was ever a hassle. From organising late night car transfers from the town centre back to the hotel for my family, to co-ordinating some impromptu wedding welcome drinks by the pool for 10 or so of our wedding guests (many of whom were not staying at Artemis), he was an incredibly generous host. Personally, I think it's also the little details at Artemis that are so impressive and the people - including Eddie, who was delightful - that make you miss it the moment you return home. Each morning we started our day with a delicious continental breakfast on our beautiful balcony overlooking the water, followed by a couple of hours besides the pool, where Eddie would pop up and treat us to free water, ice-cream, ice coffees and very reasonably priced (and delicious) lunches. With a huge Greek salad, tzatsiki and bread for only 9 euros (often with complimentary glasses of beer or wine), we really had no reason to leave the hotel! In the evening, we'd then return to our room and watch the sunset from our private balcony, enjoying the Happy Hour from 7-8pm which consisted of delicious (and free!) cocktails. We'd then head out to one of the delicious local restaurants Chris had recommended (Anogi is a *must* do), or grab a transfer into town to meet up with other friends. All in all, I could not recommend Artemis more highly and cannot wait to return next year and do it all again!",1
We stayed in the Honey moon suite which is lovely (no jacuzzi but thats what we wanted) Wifi is free and good. The wonderful staff were so friendly but not intrusive. We planned to do a bit of travelling but didn't leave the balcony.! Breakfast served on balcony at whatever time up to 12..In the Evening Sunsets with cocktails ... Angela and Chris are so accommodating. We felt really looked after. Just what we needed ...A true holiday. We will be back!,0
"From the minute we arrived until the minute we left this hotel and its staff were absolutely wonderful. Chris and Angela arranged an airport pick up for us and we arrived at the hotel late around midnight. Someone was on hand to meet us and carry our luggage, and our hosts had thoughtfully left some snacks, water and a carafe of wine for us.We stayed in room 116 which was well appointed. Comfortable bed, sofa, a small kitchen area with fridge which was really handy and a good sized bathroom. Shower was powerful and there was always plenty of hot water. There were facecloths and excellent toiletries replenished daily. Air con in the room which worked really well. There was a safe in the wardrobe and plenty of hanging space and storage for our clothes. We had a balcony with a private hot tub, a table and chairs and two deckchairs. Views as everyone has said were spectacular. Sunsets each night right in front of you. Rooms were cleaned to a high standard daily, plenty of water left and beach and bath towels changed daily. Pool area was lovely with a deep pool, sun loungers and a hot tub. There was a shower and toilet in this area and it was spotless.The hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant but it's really not needed. Breakfast is served either on your balcony or by the pool daily and it is outstanding. There is lots of food and fruit and it's great quality. The hotel provides free coffee and cake during the day and you can also buy drinks and salads which again are great quality and reasonably priced. Between 7pm and 8pm each night the staff come to your room and offer free cocktails while you watch the sunset. Little touches like weather cards and different small gifts such as chocolates and bookmarks are left each evening. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. You don't need to lift a finger. Everything is brought to you when you needed. When sat by the pool each day they would bring free fruit, ice cream and as much water as you needed. It's these little touches that make the difference. Chris gave us good advice on restaurants, made bookings for us, talked to us about the island and arranged cars. Nothing is too much trouble. Many of the people staying at the hotel that we talked to had stayed there before and that really tells you everything you need to know. Staff are well trained and friendly without being intrusive. They have worked there a long time and it shows. On our last day we didn't need to leave for the airport until 9pm and as no one was booked into our room until the next day, Chris and Angela allowed us to have full use of the room and all facilities until we left which meant we had a fully last day of our holiday.I wouldn't hesitate to return here and plan to do so in September 2016. We had a wonderful stay and I'd highly recommend this hotel. Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so special.",2
"We just returned from a 7 night stay here and it was amazing. We are a family of 4 including 2 teenage daughters. We booked the Suite for 4 and it was perfect with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. The main living area has a nice cozy seating for relaxing and reading in the evenings. Wi-Fi was good. We had 2 outdoor areas -- an upstairs balcony and a terrace with a nice long entryway to our front door. Nepresso machine in room gave my jet legged body some needed caffeine. There is a big Jacuzzi for 4 on your terrace but we aren't really Jacuzzi people so did not use very much. All the reviews on here are spot on -- this place is truly special. This is truly a family run hotel and Angela and Chris personally are involved in all aspects of running the hotel. Chris will make dinner reservations for you. Angela suggests an excellent boat tour, where to lunch in Oia (Floga), etc. The staff are first rate, Eddie, Sonia, Juliet and Gazi. I never thought that the best part of my day would be sitting on the terrace waiting for Eddie to come around at 7pm to take our drink order! My daughter's birthday fell during our stay and they made such a big deal out of it. She was truly touched. Pool area nice and plenty of seating. Staying in Imerovigli was perfect. An easy bus ride to Oia or walk/bus to Fira. There is a little supermarket close by so I could stock up the full size fridge with snacks, etc. Teenagers snack a lot! We also ordered several times from their light snack menu -- Greek Salad, bruschetta, etc. Delicious and very reasonable. There is also a bakery a further bit down that was delicious. We ate out almost every night with Chris recommending Anogi, where we ate twice. Really great food, but no view, which was fine for us since we had our own view that could not be beat! La Maison was nice for my daughter's birthday dinner -- more of a performance food type place. Also ate at Mezzo. Loved the restaurants nearby for dinner as they were an easy walk back to our suite. We arrived from Athens on the 8 hour ferry and were glad that we had Angela arrange our pick up and transfer to hotel. It is a bit of a mob scene when you come off the ferry and hard to get taxis. Throughout our stay I would pop into the reception area to have a word with Chris or Angela and were always greeted with a ""have a seat..."" They run a magical place.",1
"Words can't express how much we enjoyed staying at Artemis Villas. Angela and Chris were so knowledgeable and helpful. Every suggestion they made was wonderful. We were constantly stopping in the office to ask questions and they were always so willing to help. The views were breathtaking and Imerovigli was the perfect spot. The staff was great and so hardworking. Eddie would walk us to the bus stop and to restaurants to ensure we knew where we were going. Angela and Chris went and picked up our ferry tickets which was just an added bonus, and they went to the effort of booking our sailing excursion as well. We felt like we were treated better here than anywhere we have ever been. Breakfast was delicious as well. The only 2 negative things we could possibly say was that the wifi was kind of in and out in our room which made face timing our kids tough but you could go down in the office if you needed to for that. The private hot tub on your balcony could only be used until 9pm which was very inconvenient. We wouldn't get back from dinner until after 9 and then we didnt get to use the hot tub. I would recommend allowing guests to use the hot tub until at least 11pm. Otherwise Artemis Villas was fabulous.",1
"We were lucky enough to get to stay at Artemis Villas last week and it lived up to all our expectations and more! Angela and Chris, as well as, all the staff at Artemis are humble and extremely hard working. They go above and beyond to make your trip extra special and completely unforgettable. Our room was wonderful, so spacious, comfortable, clean and the views are out of this world! The location is perfect, an easy walk to Firostefani, Fira, and an easy bus ride to Oia. Every recommendation the staff gave us, from restaurants to excursions were amazing. And anything we needed they showed us exactly where to go (Eddie walked us to the bus stop and to our pick-up for an excursion), and Angela booked our Ferry to Naxos and got our tickets picked up for us. I can go on and on on how wonderful everything was and we hope to return one day to enjoy the beauty of Imerovigli and the hospitality of Chris and Angela!   Room Tip: We stayed in 116 and loved it!

"We just returned home from our honeymoon stay and cannot say enough great things about this hotel and all the staff. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning due to our flight, and they immediately started waiting on us even though we had not even checked in yet. They arranged for us to have breakfast at the pool area while we waited for our room to be ready. The staff are all so kind and willing to help you with whatever you need. The views from the rooms are indescribable and you surely don't want to miss the cocktail hour from 7 to 8! They will bring you your free drink on your balcony so you can watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to get to return one day in the future!   Room Tip: Get a room with the Jacuzzi on the balcony! See more room tips",1
"I was sitting by the pool face down, wishing I had water and not wanting to go back to my room to get it. I sit up, and there beside me is a bottle of water, quietly placed there with thoughtfulness and a level of service that anticipates your needs above and beyond. The view: far superior to any view on the island of Santorini. DON'T stay in Oia, it is so over-rated and crowded. I can't imagine a better view than Artemis Villa's. And it's so wonderfully romantic and quiet.The service: Angela and the whole team make you feel like a million bucks. Truly some of the kindest people I've met. Special extras: We were greeted by wonderful towel art every night. They organized our rides to and from the port expertly, with hardworking and friendly guys always carrying our luggage, walking us to the bus stop, or meeting our car at midnight to walk us to our room. They offer a free drink at happy hour and coffee and cake in the morning and afternoons!Location: Sitting between Fira and Oia, it's a short distance to get to either place, or you can walk by moonlight to Firostefani which I highly recommend. I honestly feel sorry for a tourist who doesn't stay in Imerovigli and Artemis Villas...it was truly the BEST.",1
"We cannot say enough great things about this hotel and all the staff. The rooms are clean and beautiful with gorgeous views of the caldera. The staff are all so incredibly hard working, nice, and willing to help you with whatever you need. No matter what, every time we saw any staff member, we were greeted with a smile and no matter our request, we were told ""no problem."" And they are on their feet, working hard all day long. Angela and the reception staff were so accommodating and helpful, from booking a cruise to finding a taxi or giving you a Greek chocolate bar to try. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We are here on our honeymoon and are having such a nice experience that we didn't even wait until we got home to write this. We hope to come back to Artemis in the future if we are ever able to make it back to Santorini!!",1
"We are just home from one week at Artemis Villas (June 2015). We absolutely loved our holiday - made so special by this hotel. Angela and Chris are a top couple - whatever you want they are on it. I would particularly like to mention Eddie and Sonia...I am sure without them this slick operation would not run so smoothly! Every day the rooms were cleaned superbly and a delight to return to - I even loved the smell of the fresh laundry! Endless offers of fresh towels - little treats (I won't spoil it for you) and as much ice cold bottled water as you need.We were very lazy and spent most days by the pool - then watching the sunset from our balcony. We always went out for dinner after sunset (so special every night and no better than from the hotel - believe me) and had some great food - I will review restaurants separately but we loved Avocado for lunch, Kapari and La Maison for dinner were excellent too. Had a couple of crazy nights out in Fira...we had the perfect balance we felt in Imerovigli. So peaceful and civilised with the option of nightlife if you need it a short distance away.We are lucky enough to have had lots of lovely holidays to lots of different countries but NEVER have we experienced such fantastic customer service as here. For the money we paid this was an excellent value trip. Thank you so much, Helen & Lego   Room Tip: We had 116 and loved it - everything we needed but our balcony was one of the most private we felt See more room tips",1
Stayed in early June. The people make a difference here especially Angela. She knows exactly how to co-ordinate her team and produces excellent results. Pleasant room with wonderful outdoor jacuzzi where you can marvel at the view. Will definitely return. Mike and Kerrie,0
"My husband and I recently came back from our honeymoon in Santorini and we stayed at Artemis Villas....the hotel was a dream! Crisp clean white room, the most beautiful terrace and hot tub....and oh my lord the view is to die for!! The staff was so courteous and welcoming, and they went out of their way to make us comfortable. We are so happy with our choice and highly recommend this hotel! We would definitely come back again!",0
"We stayed here for a week in June. The rooms are tucked away in Imerovigli right on the edge of the Caldera, with a fantastic view from every room. We had the smallest room but it still had its own balcony and chairs, free wifi etc. breakfast was really good value with fresh fruit, yoghurt, more bread than you can eat . Free coffee and cake could be brought to your balcony in the morning and evening along with sunset cocktails. It is just 25 mins walk from Thira, or a short walk to the bus stop.Nothing was too much trouble for Angela and Chris - they booked cruises and car rental for us (really good value for both). The room cleaning was immaculate - we are not tidy people and they looked after us so well - and every single member of staff was friendly and helpful. My husband wanted to give this place 10 stars! We cannot recommend it highly enough.",2
One of the jewels in our Greece trip. Overlooking the great views in this peaceful city you find among others the Artemis Villas. I do not know the other places but for our short less than a day visit we got royal treatment lot of attention large equipped suite and all managed by the magic couple Chris and Angela. They and the team run fantastic place which we already miss. See you soon again,0
"Perhaps you're well-traveled, perhaps you've been lucky to have seen majesty... The view from Artemis Villas should be added to your list. The view from the patios (every room has one) is superbly stunning and breathtaking. My girlfriend and I spent 5 great days in Santorini and the hotel was absolutely super superb. The day we arrived our shower had no hot water. No Home Depot, folks. The Manager, Chris got one of his guys to come up and fix the problem within the hour. Free Happy Hour cocktail every night so you can sip a drink and melt yourself into the sunset. Sitting poolside you're brought snacks and can get drinks served to you.Imerovigli is a bit quieter than Fira and Oia so if you're not looking for a late night bar-scene I would consider the location and especially this hotel.This is one of those places you can book on TA reviews alone. It's worth every penny. The staff is fantastic and will break their backs to make sure you have a great stay. We are so glad we stayed at Artemis Villas. Thanks to you all!   Room Tip: Our room (115) I thought was perfect. See more room tips",0
"In 2008, my husband and I spent a week here and have been desperate to go back again to savour the wonders of the first-class people, service and location of this beautiful hotel. Since our last trip, the owners have made many upgrades (who'd have known it needed any?!) Angela and her staff treat every visitor as a best friend who is there to enjoy their wonderful island and all of its magic. There is no request too difficult that AV won't try to honour... and they always do. This hotel has the wonderful intimacy of a small, family run operation with all the privileges of a large hotel chain. If we could return every year, we would! Santorini is simply not the easiest place to get to from Southern California, but my goodness, this is soooooo worth the wait.   Room Tip: We had a Jacuzzi on our patio.As an insomniac,I would sit in it at 3am to watch the moon over the Ae... See more room tips",0
"If you are in Santorini, you must stay at Artemis Villas in Imerovigli! I don't think words can describe how gorgeous the property is, how thoughtful the service is, and how comfortable the rooms are. Let's start with location -- you are a handful of steps away from the trail path from Fira-Oia. So, you can do the wonderful hike to either city. Or, you can take the bus, which is super close. Plenty of great restaurants in close walking distance. The property itself overlooks the scenic caldera -- you can see the perfect sunsets directly from your balcony. And it's quiet! Compared to Oia, it is so peaceful! We enjoyed just sitting on the balcony and watching the view -- esp, first thing in the morning for breakfast/coffee -- very serene and blissful. Service is top notch -- Angela thinks of everything -- we had water bottles in the room (replaced every day), along with fruits. She provides coffee/tea and cake in the morning and afternoon + happy hour drinks during sunset time. You really feel at home. The staff is super polite and always offering to assist. We were a party of 4 adults, my parents are in their late 60s/early 70s and Angela made sure someone helped them with their bags and took them to the bus station the day that my husband and I went on the hike. She is wonderful -- anything we needed, she was more than happy to assist. Angela really knows the area, she recommended some great restaurants and even made reservations for us. On the day we arrived, she offered us drinks/dessert. It was lovely. The room was spacious and comfy. I loved the olive oil toiletries they had in the shower. I definitely want to go back to Santorini and I will definitely stay at Artemis if I do.",0
"Really fantastic accommodation - everything you could need: attentive, friendly staff who literally can't do more for you, fabulous views from your room and pool area, great food for breakfast and snacks and good location in Imerovigli. We stayed in a Superior Suite which had 2 balconies overlooking the sea, double bed, kitchenette, TV, private bathroom and great wifi access (the wifi was good everywhere at Artemis). The room was spotless and housekeeping kept it this way each day. You can order a continental or American breakfast for the following day (10 euro) and it is delivered to your balcony so that you can enjoy the stunning views whilst you eat...and the breakfast quality is very high.The staff are lovely and extremely attentive. There is 'happy' hour every evening where you can order free drinks and a snack menu serving salads and nibbles (which are generous in portion size!) Really quiet at night so you can get a good night's sleep!Restaurants are only a short walk away - there are lots of stairs around Imerovigli in general so you need to be prepared for this orbit could come as quite a surprise! Would definitely return to this accommodation - haven't got a bad word to say about it!",2
"We stayed in the two bedroom apartment here and were completely happy with our choice. The villa sits on the rim of the volcano in the middle of the island so that Oia on one end and Akrotiri on the other were all within easy reach, and the views are as good as you can get on Santorini. Combine that with spacious rooms, lovely bathrooms, a kitchen with a coffee machine and a balcony with our own jacuzzi and we were in heaven. But wait, there's more: a happy hour at sunset every night where the drinks are delivered to your room for free, free wifi which is better than most hotels, king sized beds, air conditioning, a stunning breakfast delivered to your balcony each morning by smiling staff, free coffee & cake in the morning, lots of coat hangers that are not nailed down, free water and staff with lots of good recommendations for restaurants and advice for buses etc - we were even escorted to the bus stop the first time.The only drawback I could find was that our room was down 70 steps, so if you are at all challenged in this regard it might be a problem for you, but when we arrived two Greek weightlifters picked up 2 heavy suitcases each and tucked a third under their arms and effortlessly delivered them to our rooms, and the reverse when we left.If you asked me if there was something else I could want I'd be hard pressed to answer. Milk for the coffee in the frig? Tissues? But that's being mean, and Artemis Villas definitely are not.We highly recommend this place, and we would return.",2
"We loved the location on the island! It was a 20 minute walk along a path to Fira which seemed like less because there is much to see along the way. You can walk 1.5 hours the other direction along a path to Oia. My husband and I rented a car instead for 60E/day. Traffic is kinda hectic in downtown Fira though! The hotel had amazing views! No disappointment there! The rooms were definitely small but were very nice. The bed was a bit too soft for our liking, but I'm sure that's just a preference thing. The staff at the hotel was off the hook! The owners Angela and Chris. We also loved the wait staff Eddie from Armenia. They were always there to do anything we asked. Where is a good restaurant? Can you help us book a cab? Which boat tour should we go on? They made all phone calls for us. Arranged all airport transfers for us. Catered the amazing American breakfast to our patio at a time of our choice between 9am and noon each day. We could get unlimited water delivered to our room because one should not drink the tap water anywhere on Santorini. Free happy hour cocktails each day from 7-8pm. If you are at the pool between noon-5pm, one of the staff will bring you up a tasty snack like an ice cream bar or a frozen yogurt. We had room service lunch delivered to the pool area one day and they added in a complementary glass of wine. The pool was kinda small and not an infinity like some other hotels offer, but we still had fun doing cannonballs there! We appreciated it all very much!   Room Tip: Room 115 was a good location between entrance, pool, and front desk. See more room tips",2
"We were two couples who stayed at Artemis Villas for six nights. We booked the Suite for Four - a wonderful unit with two bedrooms, a huge common area, a private hot tub and two balconies overlooking a fabulous view of the caldera. The location in Imerovigli is perfect in every way - central for hiking, restaurants and shopping - but also off the main roads with all the crowds and tour buses. Hosts Angela and Chris and their competent and cheerful staff provide excellent personalized service. They took care of numerous restaurant booking details and even picked up our ferry tickets. Coffee and cakes in the morning and happy hour every day with free cocktails were a great bonus. Overall, a brilliant choice for a Santorini vacation. By the way, do not miss eating out at least one night at La Maison Restaurant, a ten minute walk from Artemis. Brilliant fusion of Greek and Continental food served with flair.   Room Tip: Suite for Four a knockout. See more room tips",1
"We have to apologize for the owners on being late with our review since we went in the summer of 2014. I travelled with my girlfriend in the beginning of August (busiest season). We went to Greece and France on this vacation and have been on a number of other European vacations in the past. First of all, the service is absolutely unmatched. The two owners and the staff were always around and always extremely helpful. We had reserved a sunset cruise before our trip, but upon telling them about our plans they found us a better boat for a much cheaper rate. The complimentary happy hour was done the right way. The staff was constantly checking if you wanted another glass. Another highlight of our stay at Artemis was our time at the pool. Although the pool is a bit small, if you get the chairs at the front the view is still amazing. Also, the staff members would come up to the pool to offer the guests different refreshments throughout the day. The location is perfect as it is situated between Oia and Fira. This was our first trip to Santorini and this small town is about a 25 min walk to Fira, which can be a little hectic if you are trying to relax. We travelled to Oia on a 4-wheeler (much easier than the 2 hour+ walk) to watch the sunset one night. It was beautiful, however, the view from the balconies of Artmeis Villas was way better in our opinion. We were able to kick back on our patio chairs with glasses of wine or champagne and watch the sun go down with unobstructed, perfect views. We stayed 2 nights in the White Suite, which was a treat. Highly recommended if this is within your price range. The remainder of our stay was in a Superior Studio with a Jacuzzi. This was also very nice but was smaller and less private as the walkways in Santorini cut through the hotels. To conclude, I cannot wait to go back to Santorini and I also cannot wait to stay at Artemis Villas again. The best service around and for sure the highlight of our vacation.",2
"Imerovigli is a great place to stay with the staggering views of the caldera, not too far from the tourist hot spot, the capital Thira. To talk full advantage of the location, ideally you need to be prepared to walk into Fira (30 mins) and back (50 mins uphill!). You can also walk to Oia (2 hours +). Both of these walks take you along the edge of the Caldera.The hotel has everything you need, albeit not as plush as other accomodation around you. This is reflected in the price. Artemis is a family run business and was built on the old family house. So the rooms have a more intimate air than some of the more upmarket accomodation. Although staff happily serve you free drinks in happy hour on your balcony or in your room, there is no common facility e.g. a bar and not many restaurants nearby. If you are prepared to walk a little you can find plenty of bars and restaurants in FiroStefani which sits between Imerovigli and Fira.   Room Tip: The cheapest and smallest room is Ok for a few nights, however you can either shower or use the toil... See more room tips",0
"We stayed at the Artemis for a week in May. The location is second to none. Why scramble and fight with the crowds for the sunset view in Oia when its there on your balcony every night? From our arrival when we were personally greeted by Angela and her staff right up to our time of departure the level of customer service at the Artemis was truly exceptional. I believe we had the smallest room in the complex but we had a balcony with that spectacular view, a kitchenette, double bed and bathroom and were left wanting for nothing. We enjoyed three sunsets in the roof top jacuzzi (booked each night with preference given to those rooms without their own hot tubs). Sipping free Happy hour cocktails the sunset experiences were memorable. There are virtually no communal areas (dining room etc) apart from the small rooftop pool but there is a pretty wide selection of snacks and drinks available which are delivered to your balcony with a minimum off fuss by very efficient and friendly staff. A word of caution though, almost everywhere you walk between Fira, Imerovigli and Oia involves climbing up very steep paths or steps. 25 minutes downhill takes you to Fira, 2 hours the other way takes you to Oia (spectacular coastal path). There are some restaurants nearby and I would particularly recommend Anoti (we visited twice). Hired a quad from nearby Sunbird rentals (very friendly) and spent a full 8 hour day exploring the rest of Santorini. Highly recommended - the ruins of Akrotiri (much older than Pompeii), the southern lighthouse, the ferry port at Athina (for the Italian job type road down to it), the monastery at Mount Ilias (view the whole island) and Pirgo (beautiful village en route). Would I recommend this hotel - absolutely.   Room Tip: Due to the layout on a steep cliff I think every room has a superb view See more room tips",1
We stayed 8 nights and had a wonderful time. Incredible view. Incredible staff with a cleaning service i have never experienced like this before. Daily free drinks and snacks. Breakfast on the balcony. Just perfect.,0
"Me and my wife spent one week at Iconic in July and it was great experience. Hotel location is just on the cliffs of Santorini overlooking the volcano and the view is fabulous. Service at Iconic is pure pampering an no detail is missed. Breakfast on the room terrace was best part of my day, eating and enjoying beautiful view! Hotel chef prepares amazing food and listens to your wishes! Anything you need hotel staff is there to help you, from getting anything in hotel to the sightseeing of the island. Mr Vella, manager of the hotel brings experience to the next level! All in all, unique place and unique experience!",0
"From the moment we arrived at the Iconic hotel ... to the moment we left, I'd describe our experience at this hotel as spectacular. We have very high standards, which the hotel staff absolutely exceeded on multiple fronts.The Food: was amazing thanks to Chef Kostas ! Note: there is no set menu ... every single day there is something different, which keeps things interesting. The Team: Every single member of the hotel team was fantastic .... especially Archontis, Vladimir, Yiannis and Dimitria ... who really looked after us and were attentive without being over-bearing (there is always a fine-line between being attentive and invasive ... the team at Iconic have it done perfectly) ! This is definitely a hotel I'm recommending to friends/family who are planning a trip to Santorini ! I'll certainly be back here again ! The Room: very clean ... the bed was so comfortable ... and great views from the hotel balcony area ! I loved the Aesop toiletries too !Thanks to the Iconic team for making it a great experience ! Our home away from home !I'd give this 6 stars if I could !",0
I have to say Dimitris the hotel manager and Chef Kostas and the whole team are simply unique. I have never had a more comfortable stay in any hotel in the world. The suites truly are spectacular and on a whole new level of understated luxury.Chef Kostas' food is quite simply scrumptious. Where in the world do u have a chef that cooks whatever you want AS LONG AS THE PRODUCE IS NOT ONLY AVAILABLE BUT MEETS WITH HIS VERY HIGH STANDARD.The views from every single angle of the hotel are breathtaking.The infinity pool a joy.The team work as a family and make your stay quite simply divine. No request is to big. Bare in mind they are climbing literally hundreds of stairs (going up and down) all day long and yet they maintain a smile at all times.Dimitris you and your team rock!,0
"We stayed at the Iconic for 5 night a few weeks ago. The spectacular views you get from the hotel are only surpassed by the spectacular personal service we received at this wonderful hotel. There are various rooms available, ranging from the delux to the suites with your own plunge pool or spa pool. Even though this hotel is not cheap it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff were amazing, and I mean everyone of them. They just seemed to appear out of nowhere but were never intrusive. They delivered your breakfast to your own personal breakfast area whenever you wanted it. The food was superb, breakfast and evening meals. The views over the Caldera and the volcano were spectacular, and unforgettable. There are many steps to get to this hotel so this should be considered when booking, but it is definitely worth it! Every trip you wanted will be organised at the hotel, which makes your stay perfect. Loved our stay and will definitely be back.",0
"After experiencing 5 of the best known restaurants in Santorini tonight we returned to our favorite. Icon. If was good before it was even better tonight. Good food makes a good Resturant but combined with good service it is what makes a great a great Resturant. Veronica, Fanny and Sophia made our last night in Santorini everything we could hope for. Beautiful food and the best service on the island. Give it a try. Well worth it.",0
"We stayed for a long weekend and it started well when we were met at the airport. Our room was in a great position on the edge of the cliff overlooking the caldera with its own hot tub.The dinner menu was written down on blackboards as the produce was purchased fresh each day so the menu was set dependent on what was in the market. The chef and wait staff were really friendly and we had great fun discussing what to eat. What was wonderful was the willingness to accommodate food likes and dislikes regardless of what was on the menu.Breakfast was served having made a call to reception on the table just outside the room. The selection differed each day but again likes and dislikes were catered to. What's not to like. The pool area was delightful and a great place for lunch, which (like dinner and various breakfasts) was delicious. All told a wonderful stay and I'd dash back in a heartbeat.",0
"I researched a lot before I booked the trip to Santorin. Out of the top 5 recommendations, I chose to go with Iconic. I sent them a enquiry request and they were so diligent in coming back to me with all the info I might need to make informed decision. We stayed in the Caldera suit and I am so glad we chose that, the view is absolutely amazing. The staff are world class, they took such good care of us form the minute we landed in Santorin till we left. I will compare all my holiday experiences going forward with Iconic experience as they have set the bar for me. Mr. Vella, Katia, Dimitra, Archontis and the rest of them go out of their way to ensure you have the best time. I would recommend them to everyone and probably will not be staying anywhere else when we return.Regards,Pallavi",0
"We have returned from this beautiful island, where we had the good fortune to have chosen the Iconic as our hotel. The stay from the moment we were welcomed from the taxi to the moment we left was truly amazing.The location and setting of the hotel is absolutely breathtaking, which is matched by Mr Vella , the driving force behind the hotel and his truly wonderful staff, including the resident chef whose food is delicious, original and made with love.I have never felt compelled to write a review before such as this, but the Iconic in Santorini is truly worthy of it's excellent TripAdvisor rating. Book this hotel, you won't regret it!Sara and Martin",0
"We had intended to return to Chromata Hotel, which we love. Unfortunately, we were arriving on a whim and they were fully booked. They recommended the Iconic which is next door and made the reservation for us. Our experience at the Iconic made it a difficult choice to go back to the Chromata, which we ultimately did. The staff is amazing and the morning complimentary breakfast individually prepared and served at our roomside outdoor table. The pool is slightly heated which makes it perfectly refreshing on a hot summer's day. The suite, while smaller than our suite at Chromata, was beautifully appointed and very comfortable with great bath products by Aesop and two full bathrooms with showers. The bed is a dream and linens very high-end. Lunch and dinner are prepared by Chef Konstantinos with fresh products daily and served either on our private terrace or in the intimate dining space with a magical view of the caldera. You can not go wrong booking here.",1
"My partner and I have spent 10 days in Santorini. We first staid in Oia in order to visit the area. After 4 days in the very crowded village of Oia we went to a much quitter one: Imerovigli.Here the hotel you pick is even more important as this is the place in Santorini where you come in order to relax. If Oia is the most visited and busiest town (along with Thira), Imerovigli would be the “relaxing” spot of Santorini.After 4 days in Oia, I was more than happy to switch and stay at the Iconic Hotel in Imerovigli. I heard this hotel was incredible and had not only the best views but also the best chef named Kostas, who will cook different Greek dishes everyday from breakie to dinner! Indeed, I wasn’t disappointed! 4 days here gave me more than time to try it all (and probably gain some kilos)!Oh and another big plus: as you could see on the pics I uploaded, their plunge pools’ views were definitely unbeatable and probably the best in the Island!In fact, I was having my breakfast, lunch, orange juices and chilling moments by my pool with views I didn’t get from Oia!When we arrived we were greeted with welcome drinks and enjoyed the amazing view to the caldera and volcanic island. The manager Mr. Vella came and welcomed us too. They were all impeccable and very friendly. Our suite was very spacious, bright, with white walls, and decorated with taste: it had 2 bathroom (one downstairs), a large sitting/chilling area with fruit, wine, coffee machine, bottle of waters (they bring you 2 bottles everyday and you can ask more if needed - all complimentary) and the bedroom. We had a huge terrace with an amazing plunge pool, chairs and table. The staff is simply impeccable, and clean your room twice a day: one in the morning and another in the evening. The hotel is very quiet as we expected. With a great respect for your privacy.After 2 days relaxing between our private pool and the Infinite one + eating the delicious dishes of the Chef Kostas, it was time to get some action! We therefore asked to the concierge to reserve a buggy for us and we went to explore the Island black beaches with a member of the staff who showed us the hidden gems of the Santorini! Yes, Santorini has black beaches indeed! And I bet a lot of people that come to the Island never heard of the volcanic Monolithos beach located next to Kamari at a distance of about 9 km from Thira. I’m very happy to have spent here 4 incredible days at the Iconic hotel, such a great experience! Oh and of course, getting to know some delicious Greek dishes ! Thank You Dear Kostas for your amazing dedication in the Art of cooking!If you love food like I do, then don’t look further, this place is the right spot for you! You will have a dedicated Chef to prepare you unique daily dishes like if you were at home! Even for breakfast we had different dishes everyday! No buffets, everything is brought to you.The hotel also has a gym which I went twice to compensate all the delicious dishes I was eating. In sum, was a perfect stay, my partner and I had amazing culinary experiences, plenty of time to relax, get tanned, take amazing pics of the incredible view, and visit with a buggy some other areas of the island.I will definitely come back!",2
"Dear Iconic Santorini,We never write reviews but this stay was so exceptional and special that we felt it our duty to review just how amazing this hotel experience was. We booked for 4 nights and it was our first visit to Santorini. Immediately upon arrival you are warmly greeted and when walked down to your room the first thing that hits you is the incredible views! Both my husband and I are lucky to have traveled around a lot of the world and my husband's job means he's stayed in many of the best hotels, however absolutely nothing compares to the incredible view that awaits you on from the hotel. The combination of peaceful, boutique hotel is complimented with impeccable bespoke service. You quickly know the small team of staff by name and are reminded that if you require anything bespoke for breakfast or dinner then the chef will prepare it for you. We opted to be surprised every morning by a different breakfast which we found much more fun. Also on our first night we received a complimentary meal as part of our stay which we enjoyed in the open air restaurant over looking the Caldera. We both had sea bass which was wonderful and we're treated to a complimentary dessert wine also. The room was incredible and had the biggest bed we've ever slept in. All the amenities and facilities were flawless but most of all the feeling of being in a quiet little hideaway with wonderful service a simple call away was the best part of this stay. We had recommendations for dinner and day trips from the staff and this took away all the stress of planning and not knowing where to go. Dominic booked us a beautiful restaurant in Oia for the sunset and also suggested great places in Thira. Our only recommendation for anyone staying is that you must be aware you are staying on a cliff with many stairs to climb to and from the street level to the hotel. It is part of the whole experience and hard to avoid but worth noting for anyone with any disabilities. Our only regret is that we left so quickly that we didn't get to say goodbye or tip all the staff, hence we wanted to write this review to express just how much we loved our stay and appreciated everyone's efforts to make us feel welcomed and so well looked after. This is as close to a heavenly paradise experience as its come for us and we wish to return in the future. Many thanks to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful. Sara & James",2
"As a hotelier myself I know how hard it is to strive for perfection but I can definitely say Iconic Santorini is perfection itself.I stayed for a week at the beginning of July this year with my partner (who is now my Fiance, following my stay at the Iconic) and I can only say you will not be disappointed with both Santorini or the Iconic.I think what Vella (Hotel General Manager) and Demitris (Hotel Resident Manager) have created is something truly unique.Iconic is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, in a breathtaking location overlooking the caldera. From the initial greeting outside the hotel by Demitris to the most amazingly warm check-in by Dimitra, Kostas, Katia and Archontis every need was cared for. The food by chef Kostas and his team Teodor, Mattheos and Alex (You will find it hard to find anywhere in Santorini as good) was simply exceptional. We ate in the restaurant the majority of our stay and were looked after so well by Vladimir and Yiannis.The whole property is meticulously maintained and guest rooms are serviced twice a day by the friendliest of housekeeping staff in Sofia, Vasso and Julia.The place is so magical and the location does not seem real, however you arrive as guests but leave as friends. I will never forget how Demitris and his team looked after us and made are holiday so magical. I can't wait to return.Jonathan",2
"everything was splended! hope to be back soon with my wife! especially the food, but most of all the hospitality of all the staff, making you feel like you are home, and not under any big hotel umbrella faculty.",0
"All staff members at the Iconic are naturally polite and helpful without coming across as overbearing.One night there were no taxis available,we were running late for our dinner reservation so the manager drove us to Fira.The property is well maintained and immaculate. The food was exceptional, we really enjoyed breakfast which was different each day. The view of the Caldera is exceptional from this hotel. I highly recommend the Iconic.",1
"All that was written before me is true. Iconic Santorini is the premier place to stay in Santorini and there is nothing like it on earth. If you value quality, tranquility, and incredible service, you too will appreciate every detail of your experience.Everything is in the details. The views, the food, the space, the rooms, the design, the hospitality. Perfect. General Manager, Mr Vello is orchestrating a masterpiece, and it is very easy to see why. I've stayed in hotels all around the world and there is simply nothing like it. My boyfriend and I were searching for a true, relaxing holiday to escape the world. We didn't just want to stay with the masses but wanted to indulge in something unique, with class, and of the utmost quality. We stumbled across Iconic via Trip Advisor and I am very thankful.Our experience was beyond imagination. The incredible hospitality of the staff and their willingness to help make plans and special arrangements made me feel like a celebrity. Thank you especially to Archontis, as well as Katia and Demitra, for making our stay truly wonderful. With your recommendations and planning, the time we spent away from the hotel exploring the island was a fantastic experience. Although being at Iconic was so much better! The food was simply exceptional. Seasonal, local, and in every way delicious. Chef Kostas is working magic in the kitchen. We eagerly anticipated breakfast each morning! Enjoying delicious food and coffee while the island came to life, all from the comfort of our private terrace overlooking the caldera, was the best part of each the day (especially our morning chats with Mr Vello!). Morning is just not the same! Thank you for taking such good care of us. The lunch and dinner menu is also above and beyond. We enjoyed the daily menu several times while staying there and found the quality and price to be better than anywhere else on the island. I'm still drinking Assyrtiko and cooking some of the recipes from the kitchen, so thank you for all the inspiration! Finally, the rooms are simply perfect. Cozy and well designed. Again, every detail was accounted for. With our private terrace and those jaw dropping views, it was difficult to leave.Everything made for a perfectly relaxing and rejuvenating experience. It's a trip we will never forget!   Room Tip: Every room is special. See more room tips",1
"I work in consulting so I've visited many hotels in the past. This time I visited Iconic for my honeymoon. It was perfect in every aspect: service, view, ammenities, food etc!From arrival you truly feel as a VIP guest. The area is a bit far from touristic areas (Ios and Firos) which makes it much more romantic and personal.   Room Tip: The private pool doesn't make it or brake it, BUT rooms with private pools have balcony privacy... See more room tips",0
"After enduring a nightmare journey of cancelled flights and long delays my partner and I arrived at the Iconic and we were completely overwhelmed, firstly by how beautiful Santorini is and secondly by how wonderful the hotel was. We were upgraded to the Cliff Suite, which had the most beautiful view of the Caldera, sitting on the terrace enjoying the freshly prepared delicious breakfasts every morning and taking in that view was certainly one of my highlights of the trips. Along with the stunning view we also had a beautiful dip pool on our balcony which was perfect for cooling down and enjoying the evening sun with a cold drink as well as a sun lounging area perfect for sunbathing, reading and relaxing. The terrace was so quiet and peaceful sometimes you could hear your own thoughts. The room itself was beautifully decorated and fully equipped with a super-size ultra-comfy bed. The bathroom also had everything you could need along with generous sized environmentally friendly products. The restaurant was simply amazing, the chef prepares a fresh menu every day cooking up the delights he has found fresh in the market that day. We enjoyed several meals during our stay and each time they were exceptional, from the presentation to the delicious bursting flavours of the local produce. Finally the last thing that makes The Iconic one of the stand out hotels I have visited is the friendly and attentive staff nothing is too much trouble for them, whether it suggesting things to do on the island, bringing cold drinks down to the room or suggesting restaurants to enjoy they are always happy to help. They all know your name and always stop for a chat, asking how your day has been and if there is anything they can do for you. They really all make you so feel so relaxed and welcome during your stay. I couldn’t recommend Santorini highly enough as a holiday destination and this perfect, beautiful boutique hotel is just the icing on top of a marvelous cake. I am already counting down the days to our return.",2
"Unparalleled Service. Met at airport by the Manager, a short trip to the hotel in the air conditioned Iconic vehicle. Beautiful views, beautiful rooms. Personal attention. Outstanding fresh cuisine, the chef will make you anything you want. Eat when you would like in one of many tiny corners of this exquisite hotel, on your terrace or on one of the four little tables by the pool. Whites and blues, sun and sea breezes on the slopes of Santorini. Staff are exceptional. Beyond helpful in trip planning and organisation, with great suggestions of what to do and what not to do. Nothing negative to say here.   Room Tip: All of the rooms are good See more room tips",0
"This boutique hotel lives up to expectations. Stunning views, Exceptional staff service, friendly atmosphere with every need catered for. Quiet setting but with plenty of other restaurants and shops within walking distance. Some steep steps so will keep you fit too!",0
"The hotel is beautifully decorated. Rooms fully equipped with comfy beds, Aesop products and lovely bathrooms. The terraces have a spectacular view of the Caldera with wonderful loungers and sofa areas for sunbathing. The staff are incredibly attentive and nothing is too much trouble. We could take breakfast wherever we fancied in the hotel, at whatever time we wanted and someone always popped up to offer a cocktail at just the right time. The food is spectacular with a different menu each day cooked up form what Chef finds at the local markets. There a lots of recommendations for local activities. We would particularly recommend the Catamaran tour of the Caldera - but only sit at the front if you are ready to get WET! With a view of the other hotels I feel confident in saying that we were staying in by far the nicest hotel in the area.",1
"This place is perfect. The stand-out feature, apart from the great location and weather, is service. Nothing is too much trouble; the staff, without exception, are great. They're happy when you're happy. I'm not going to name the staff for fear of missing someone out!The room was lovely, high quality, etc, and serviced frequently and consistently.Breakfast is amazing, served to the table outside your room. A great variety of dishes, different every day. Very special.The chef at this hotel is outstanding and offers a limited number of super dishes for lunch and dinner. We ate in the restaurant most of the time because the food and service couldn't be beaten by other places in the resort.Transfers, tours, car hire are all taken care of with the minimum of fuss.I can't recommend this place highly enough, it benchmarks well against the best hotels in the world. This hotel, the island of Santorini and the weather make for the perfect holiday.Alex & Jonny",1
The iconic hotel located at the top looking down on the blue waters and picturesque white rooftops... Simply amazing Our room felt like we had our own slice of heaven!! The staff at the Iconic were so accommodating and professional. I would call them our friends for life! We can't wait to come back and visit you at the Iconic;)),0
We had a fabulous vacation. The staff was the best I have ever encountered. . They were so attentive. Our rooms were unbelievable. They were so unusual. It felt like we were living in a cave. We had a magnificent view. We would go back tomorrow.,1
"We are frequent visitors to Santorini and Imerovigli in particular - a place to just go, take in the view and chill from the moment you arrive. This was our first stay at the Iconic having previously stayed in the same hotel for the last 4 years in succession.We stayed at the Iconic for 7 nights in early June in a Deluxe Room.The Iconic didn't disappoint on any level - the greeting, the excellent level of service by all of the staff, the breakfast and the tailoring of meals by the chef Konstantinos and his team - all contributed to making our stay really special and one that a holiday should be.Special mention to Katia, Katja, Vladimir, Demitria, George, Yiannis and Yianna who all excelled in just trying to make our stay go without problem - nothing being any trouble.The room itself whilst quite small was really nicely furnished and laid out, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower spacious - everything you need from a room. The outside space was superb - your own raised level terrace with breakfast table and loungers for you to enjoy at your convenience.One of the appealing things about the hotel itself was that because of it's multi-level layout it gives you ample opportunity to shelter from the winds that can quite often be a fact of life on Santorini - along with of course the many steps - which act as a justification for all of the indulgencies that might take your fancy on holiday!I could go on more about the Iconic but suffice to say we will on our next visit be returning to stay here and hopefully that will be in the not too distant future.Just try it for yourselves!",0
"Santorini is absolutely breathtaking. The scenic caldera provides a beautiful backdrop from so many spots around the island. The blue and white buildings framed by the clear blue sky and ocean make for incredible photographs and memories. The location alone is magnificent.... Iconic Santorini hotel takes this canvas and perfectly layers a first-class hotel experience over top. Every room has wonderful sight-lines of the volcano with private balconies overlooking the scenic caldera. The hotel is not packed full of amenities because it does not need to be. The luxurious rooms, attentive staff, and peaceful atmosphere makes for a wonderfully relaxing and rejuvenating experience.Chef Kostas puts out a custom menu for lunch and dinner each day with a selection of appetizers, mains and desserts to choose from. Everything is fresh and seasonal and he is always happy to accommodate requests when possible. Dining at the hotel is affordable and delicious with highlights of Greek and local specialties. There is no need to pay for a ride into town and tourist prices for other food options.The hotel rooms are built into caves and are extremely comfortable. Many have private pools built into them. The staff are happy to bring you anything your heart desires including breakfast served daily on your private patio. They are also keen to help make your trip one you will not forget - whether making arrangements in town, with tour groups, etc. There are a lot of steps - if that's a concern, be sure to ask for a room near the top of the resort where the office/entrance are. For those in shape it's a pleasant way to work off all of Chef's delicious creations!A destination that shouldn't be missed!",1
"This Hotel is simply a lifetime experience you will never forget. Immediatly you feel at home.The cave atmosphere of the suites together with the view to the sea is breathtaking and you think you are in a storytale.The service of the Staff together with a well experienced team is outstanding and it seems your wishes will be picked up from your eyes. Luxury furnished and spacious suites provide a well feeling factor hardly to describe.All outside facilities jacuzzis,pool,terraces and patios a carefully checked for cleanliness.Amazing individually selected decoration details in-and outside are stunning especially in evening illumination,Last not least,to mention all of this dreamland would fill a book,is the Chef,s performance with a strong foccus creating honest true Greek food which still waters our mouth after return to our homeland leaving a deep thank you with a wish to return one time.

"If you are looking for the best food, the best service, spotless rooms, an indoor pool in your own room, the best bed in the world, and the best views in the universe, then stop looking NOW.

"My wife and business partner and I have been travelling extensively of recent albeit not together, with different clients and in completely opposite placed plus we have just moved into an apartment we have been renovating for the last 18 months. We were exhausted and wanted some down time together in a nice warm place that wasn't too far in flying time from the UK. We chose Santorini as the island looked amazing and picked Iconic as it seemed very boutique and peaceful. Both were good choices. Iconic was perfect. It is a small development of no more than 20 suites. All are what were traditional homes from any years ago. One suite was the village bakery. The whole place links together like an Escher mind puzzle of dozens of steps leading in different directions and at different angles. Our suite was in the second level. There are seven levels and access is from the top of a very huge cliff. The views out across the bay and over the volcano are amazing. Our suite was lovely. Naturally everything was painted white, as is everything on the island other than for a splash of blue or a dab if grey here and there. The suite was spacious, well lit and beautifully presented. It has a really good bed (super King) with a lovely firm mattress and a good selection of pillows. The bathroom was on the floor below and, whilst it had no bath, it had a great shower. The hotel has a lovely, deep blue swimming pool next to the bar and restaurant. The pool has a built in jacuzzi that overlooks the amazing bay view. We had dinner at the Iconics restaurant a few times. The food was really good and the chef decides his menu based on what he finds fresh in the market that day. We had excellent seafood there on the three occasions we visited. Service was excellent. The venue tranquil. Help was always at hand but unobtrusive. Travelling around the island was fun and interesting. We hired a great scooter and used it to go everywhere. Luckily the island is not very big so it's hard to get very lost. It is easy to take the wrong roads as sign posting seems pretty optional. Things are signposted from miles away but as you get closer they no longer show. Makes for interesting excursions. We loved being there. It was exactly what we wanted and needed. I would definitely go back and would highly recommend Iconic.",0
"I never write reviews - however this hotel is worth the effort.It's a stylish and luxurious haven in a spectacular location staffed by lovely personnel.The views are breath taking, and the hotel intimate and peaceful.I wouldn't hesitate to return.",0
"I went with my best friends.We stayed for 4 nights and had a great time at Iconic. Helpful, accomodating, pleasant and friendly staff.Breakfast was very good and room excellent. I highly recommend this place!!!",0
"From the moment we arrived and the staff welcomed us to the hotel, till the moment we departed and were waved goodbye, the attention to detail and welcoming attitude of the staff made this a very special holiday. The staff were so attentive and always available to assist. The rooms were fantastic, opening up on to the Caldera with your own private deck chairs and breakfast table. The breakfast was amazing, and the fact you could step outside your door and have breakfast at your private table overlooking the sea made it even more special. I would definitely recommend this hotel and couldn't find a single fault. Thank you.",0
"The warm and friendly staff made this beautiful hotel a really special place, this really was the best service we have ever had. The hotel was just lovely, great location, amazing views.Will definitely go back.",0
"I have never before felt compelled to write a review on any website, but after the exceptional level of service and care provided to make our stay as memorable as this one, we felt the need to share our experience of this outstanding hotel. After being severely let down by Sofia Suites two weeks prior to our arrival date, we contacted Iconic and from the very first moment, we felt a sense of care for the customer was paramount. Katia took charge of all our concerns and needs at a very stressful time and made the entire process seamless. After further phone calls, every member helped to make our imminent arrival as comfortable as possible providing us with details and information of our room and upcoming transfer time. Upon arrival we were given a quick tour and history of The Caldera by Katia and then personally greeted by the owner and GM. We stayed at the exceptional 'Cliff Suite' which has a private terrace, indoor and outdoor grotto pools and stunning views over the Caldera. We immediately felt a sense of luxury that up until now has been unrivalled on every level and no doubt will be extremely hard to top. The room itself is kept beautifully and is cleaned twice a day. The food is beyond excellent and compliments to the fantastic chef that made us breakfast and lunch daily. The spa is clean and the couples massage we had during our stay was also one of the best we have had leaving us both relaxed and recharged. Where the hotel exceeds all expectations is the level of care of the staff for the customer. By dialling '0', every single person helped to make our stay enjoyable and every specific need however trivial was answered quickly and with a smile. Katja, Archontis, Demitria, Vladimir , George - Thank you for helping us during our stay. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough and I thank the owner and all staff for the experience of a lifetime. Even now, Katia has provided us with information we requested on the day we left. I will look forward to visiting this hotel again in the future and wish every one at the hotel the best for the future!",0
"We chose to stay in Imerovigli for two main reasons. Firstly, it is in the middle of the Caldera and higher than Fira so it has the most balanced and expansive views. Secondly, staying in Imerovigli, you avoid the chaotic crowds in Fira and Oia every time cruise ships are in which is nearly every single day in Summer. Our only concern about staying in Imerovigli was that there would be fewer restaurants to choose from. Luckily we chose to stay at Iconic Santorini which made the choice of where to dine very easy as their restaurant’s Executive Chef Konstantinos and his team were simply brilliant. There was no set menu, Konstantinos prepared lunch or dinner based on the fresh ingredients he was able to get each day and he never failed to impress. We enjoyed six dinners and four lunches at their restaurant during our stay at the Iconic Santorini and each meal was superb.We stayed at this Hotel for 7 nights in late May, early June 2016, in a Caldera Suite. We chose this Hotel because all the reviews on Tripadvisor were either Excellent or Very Good; it is rare to find a hotel that does not have a single negative review. We also thought it would be a unique experience to stay in a true cave hotel. Having stayed at the Iconic Santorini for a week, we can say that besides the incredible view you enjoy, their entire staff team make the experience a truly noteworthy memory. I think most people can sense genuine sincerity, and we felt that every member of staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We really wanted to thank everyone from the GM, Vella, to the front desk team of Dimitris, Dimitra, Archontis, and Katia who arranged some tours and spa sessions for us to the Guest Services Team of Vladimir, Yiannis, Yianna, and George who attended to our every need and also Housekeeping that kept our room immaculate (apologies if we have missed anyone).Every morning, breakfast is delivered to your private patio at the time that suits you, and you get to enjoy a delicious breakfast while being mesmerized by the view … what a way to start your day. Also, the bed was fantastic. It had just the right firmness and we had a great sleep every night.Interiors have a sleek minimalist design while trying to maintain the cave house feel of the rooms. The rooms, gardens and outdoor areas are also impeccably maintained.This is the hotel to stay at if you want an awesome Santorini experience.   Room Tip: All rooms have a view - ask for your outdoor areas to be either sunny or shady depending on your pre... See more room tips",1
"We stayed at the Iconic Santorini for the culmination of our honeymoon and we could not have made a better choice. The first thing that stands out is how welcoming, lovely, personable, professional and helpful the staff ALL are. Nothing is too much, they are always available and are incredibly friendly. They strike the right balance of never feeling intrusive but always available and are lovely to talk to. They clearly work incredibly hard as the attention to detail both in service and in the upkeep of the hotel is impeccable. We cannot thank them enough for making our stay so special. What's incredible is that despite how tightly packed in all of the properties are on Santorini, you feel like you're on a private break at the Iconic. The rooms have everything that you could want and feel comfortable and homely. The private terraces are great and having breakfast served on your own terrace table is special.The chef is great and we loved how there is no set menu. The chef goes to market each day to get the freshest ingredients and creates delightful dishes from them. You can also request anything that takes your fancy which he will always try to make fresh for you. The views are breathtaking and the location is fabulous. You're far enough away from the busy restaurants, bars and shops but close enough to walk to whenever you fancy. There is plenty to do on Santorini but we loved the Iconic so much that we spent much of our time there.We cannot recommend the Iconic enough. Our stay was unforgettable.",2
From the pick up at the airport we knew that the hospitality of this hotel was going to be excellent. While our luggage was being transported to our luxurious room we were welcomed at reception with a glass of the local wine and guided through this beautiful hotel with breathtaking views and service like we have never experienced before (and we are frequent travellers). From the personalised service and perfectionism of the chef Kosta and the rest of the staff and in particular Vella we confidently recommend anyone to stay at the Iconic Santorini.,2
"This boutique hotel is simply an ""absolute iconic"". Truly, it is a ""must see"" unique experience. The charming rooms were an absolute delight; furthermore my husband and I who are environmentalist were pleased to see all their bath/ skin care products (AESOP) that were used, were made with love and respect for our environment. The staff were exceptional. The manager- Demetrius attended to all the details of our stay. Chef Konstantinos cooking was quite stellar. My husband being vegan and myself a vegetarian, chef Konstantinos took on the challenge and created some exquisite meals for us. The services and the hospitality provided by the Iconic will be etched in our memories for years to come.   Room Tip: can't go wrong with any of the rooms you choose See more room tips",0
"There are not enough words to express how good of a hotel the Iconic is. We were fortunate enough to get to stay at the Iconic because of winning a travel auction. While we were there for our three night stay, only one other couple was at the resort. We were ushered to a beautiful, large suite. This suite included personal outdoor dining space and a jacuzzi tub overlooking the caldera. Each morning you will be served a delicious homemade breakfast on your private terrace overlooking the caldera. The chef is very talented and even made a special roasted lamb shank one night, when I indicated it was a favorite meal of mine. All of the food was superb. While there, my partner had a bad fall and got quite hurt. The staff was amazing and very helpful. We got him to a private hospital. During his hospital stay the staff constantly checked on his health, drove me back and forth, the hotel picked up his medicine and even refused to let us pay for it! As if this was not enough, upon checking out, they refused to accept payment for our lunch/dinner tab, and zeroed out our account. Thank you, Iconic staff and management. You are first rate people. This is truly one of the best luxury resorts in the world!",0
"Myself and my husband visited the Iconic in September 2015.From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special. The staff are a credit to the hotel. We were first met by Christina and Panageota, who were very friendly and gave us a warm welcome. The rooms all replicate caves built into the Rock, they are all very comfortable and spacious with amazing views, we upgraded from a classic suite ( which was beautiful) to a Caldera suite for the 2nd half of our holiday, this has its own whirlpool on the terrace, all of the rooms are unique. All of the staff will go out of their way to make your holiday as special and memorable as they can. Vladimir, Dimitris and Yiannis were also very helpful and friendly throughout our stay, bringing breakfast to us on our terrace in the morning (at a time to suit you) or just by brining us drink at anytime of the day, nothing was too much trouble. Kostas in the restaurant was also an amazing chef, changing the menu each day to accommodate the fresh and local ingredients that were available that day, even taking special menu requests for the next evenings meal! Vella the hotel manager was also very friendly and was constantly making sure we had everything that we needed during our stay. My now husband proposed to me whilst we were staying at the Iconic and all the staff helped to make the occasion very very special and I can't believe they all knew about it and I did not have a clue! It was very memorable and the hotel and staff will remain a special part in our journey together. We certainly hope to return one day.",0
"Lovely interior.Lovely ambience.Nice people.What else do you need for a perfect holiday?Santorini is a beautiful island and this Iconic hotel, you got it all.Food is amazing and all cocktails too. Excelent service!",0
"I've spent about 4 days in this beautiful little charming hotel. The views early in the morning and during sunset are breathtaking, it's nice and quiet. The perfect spot to be at when you want some time off and disconnect from everything. The rooms are cave styled, decent sized. If you travel with a lot of luggage then opt for a suite. This hotel is not recommended for toddlers or kids, strictly couples and adults as i have not seen any kids amenities. There is a lot of steps as the hotel is on a cliff. The hotel staff and manager went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one and because the hotel is considered small they know you personally which makes it extra special. The food is delicious and their lunch menu changes everyday according to the chef choices.The chef even gave me the recipes of the dishes i liked. I highly recommend milkshakes on the pool they are refreshing and very tasty. Every suite comes with a little outdoor jacuzzi and a dining table. You can have your breakfast on your little terrace/patio overlooking the gorgeous view. If ultimate privacy is what you're looking for then be warned this is not the place for you, especially with families that have women covered up, as other hotels nearby are very close and they can see in clearly on to your patio, but if that's not an issue then this is the place for you.The spa was small but nice, the therapists were excellent. Rent a fiat and drive around the nearby towns it's an adventure.We arrived by helicopter from Santorini and landed in a nearby landing spot close to the hotel. The hotel contacted the helicopter charter company and arranged where they would pick us up and drive us to the hotel. Very efficient",1
"We felt extremely fortunate to find this gem of a hotel. It's got a very intimate feel. The food and service are fantastic. If we ever were to return to Santorini, this would be the hotel we would stay at most certainly. You won't regret this experience. The hot tubs are lovely too!",1
"Although we stayed here just out of season, it was just fantastic. The room was light and airey, bed was very comfortable, amazing shower and a jacuzzi on our private balcony. The views were just stunning from our jacuzzi over the caldera; just like the promotional photographs. We were looked after so well and treated like royalty by Dimitris. Every morning we enjoyed a delicious breakfast on our balcony overlooking the caldera. Fantastic advise from Dimitris enabled us to explore the island, go on great winery tours and book catamaran excursions. Our stay was relaxing and most memorable. We will definitely return to Iconic Santorini if travelling to this part of the world and would recommend it all everyone. This is a most spectacular place to visit.   Room Tip: All rooms seem to come with aview. See more room tips",2
"My wife and I made a trip to Santorini in October just before the season ended. We stayed at the Iconic Santorini hotel. We're frequent global travelers and have to say this hotel ranks as one of the finest lodging experiences we've ever had. Never mind the incredible view and luxurious facilities - it was the staff and service that impressed us the most. This property boasts their own private chef and boutique restaurant that are truly exquisite - we ate there 6 of our 7 nights! Further, the abundant, friendly and incredibly knowledgable staff were truly special. They have amazing local knowledge, warm smiles and are always happy to assist. We'll be back for sure.",1
"Amazing hotel and amazing people....would recommend this beautiful and peaceful bit of heaven to anyone. The staff could not be more helpful, I even put in an evening meal request every night, the food was amazing and I thank you all for a wonderful stay.",1
"Once you get through what is possibly one of the most decrepit airports in the World, and you get into the heart of Santorini, you will realise why you chose this island. It is enchanting and so is the Iconic hotel. Fabulous, efficient staff and comfortable rooms with breathtaking views over the bay. Our room was a little noisy at night from the outdoor air-conditioning units, but had an exclusive patio seating area where breakfast was served each day at a time of our choice. Brilliant idea and I think that all rooms benefit from this facility and service. There are a lot of steep steps from the taxi drop-off point down to the hotel reception and so not for the faint hearted. Because of this, we chose not to climb back up to the village in the evenings to explore the local restaurants, but rather, to dine in the hotel balcony restaurant. Very romantic, with stunning views and excellent food and local wine. My wife and I were there for a week in August, and therefore the room rates were at their peak. We will return at a time of year when perhaps there are better rates available.All in all, a wonderful stay.  Room Tip: Check that your room is insulated from the rather noisy outdoor air-conditioning units. See more room tips",1
"I spent my honeymon it was so amazing the service , the view, the staff ... etc everything was so perfect we were treated like a king and queen ... i will visit it again for sure its one of the best hotels i ever saw",0
"The iconic was an absolute dream to stay in. From the moment they picked us up from the airport to the moment the dropped us off at the end of our stay it was 5-star service. We got in a bit late and were greeted by Panageota who gave us a run through of the amenities and even kept the kitchen open a little late so we could enjoy our first meal. The rest of our time the there the entire staff (Christine, Yiannis, Vladimir) looked after us and made our honeymoon more than perfect. One of the managers even gave us a ride into town when we couldn't find a taxi. The views from the hotel are absolutely breathtaking and the food is some of the best we had on the island (thanks Kostas). I cannot recommend this place enough, you'll get the views from anywhere on the Caldera but the staff is what sets this hotel apart.",2
"From the time we arrived we were overwhelmed by the location,the views were incredible,the staff were fantastic ,our room was sensational.Christine greeted us and settled us into our room and went to extraordinary lengths to make our stay very pleasurable.Special mention also to Vladimir,Yiannis & Panageota who looked after us very well.Vella is the General manager and he should be very proud of his team.we are very sad to leave Iconic but hope to return again.Thanks for making this a trip of a lifetime",2
"We stayed here in August for my 25th birthday courtesy of my wonderful partner! This was nothing shy of just perfection and serene!Our view was breath taking and we were greeted with champagne on arrival! Breakfast was served to us on our private terrace every morning!!I couldn't recommend this hotel more from their attention detail to the fact we didn't even have to put our own ice cubes in our drink, needless to say the service was impeccable!For the last two nights we upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi and this just made the perfect end to the most memorable holiday!!Thank you for sharing the best views in santorini right on our doorstep! Would love to revisit the same hotel again in the future!!",0
"We stayed in the Caldera suite for 5 days and loved it. The pool was actually across the walkway, which wasn't the most private thing but the views were so beautiful and the hotel was so quiet it didn't matter. On top of that the staff was so attentive and the service was impeccable. The breakfast every morning was a true feast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in going to Santorini. Imerovigli is the perfect spot, out of the chaos of Fira but only a 20 minute walk away, and the cab ride do Oia was very quick. We loved the Iconic and hope that we will be able to return!",0
"The view is amazing and the place is very peaceful. definitely this area of the island is more on the quiet side, great for honeymooners which we were not, but still loved the hotel.. the staff made our stay even more enjoyable. Everyone was so accommodating.. Christine, Dimitri and the one who looks like Christine but starts with a P, we just called her Sweet were so wonderful.. Our room was amazing. loved the decor and size.. my friends had a much smaller room and as far as we knew we were both getting the same type of room, so be sure to ask. I don't know if this was a mistake on our travel agents' part but nevertheless we were all more than satisfied and would definitely recommend this hotel. After reading everyone's reviews after our stay, I wish we had eaten a dinner here. We had a delicious lunch and breakfasts and chose to eat out for dinner. We did not find the food on Santorini as fresh and as good as on Mykonos and we went to the restaurants that the hotel recommended. Wish we had listened to Dimitri, he told us the best was at the hotel.",1
"It’s hard to put into words the experience we've had at Iconic.The high degree of professionalism and warmth of the staff is incredible, they make you feel on holiday, relaxed, the minute you enter the hotel.We went for our honeymoon and we could not have dreamed of anything or anywhere nicer ! Mind-blowing !! They organised everything for us: private transfer from the port/to the airport; activities; restaurant bookings, etc. to make sure our stay was smooth (and it was...). The service is outstanding. It feels they work with the principle of 'you need something, just ask us and we'll get it sorted'.When you arrive at the hotel... WOW... mind-blowing view on the caldeira. It was in the perfect location for us, away from the crazy crowd at Oia and not far from the buzzing Fira. Perfect for those wishing to be close to all spots on the island while being in a romantic, calm, hidden location.The hotel itself is so romantic and the rooms are beautifully set up. We've had the feeling of being just to two of us. The food was as we like it... fresh every day! The chef prepares his menu based on what he found on the day. And for wine lovers like us, you'll be happy to see a reasonably priced wine list. And there is a SPA as well...Yes the rooms are a bit expensive, but once there, everything else is so worth it, with a great high quality/price ratio.We've had an absolutely incredible experience... and we will go back!",0
"We stayed a week in the Iconic and it was fantastic. Great location, lovely rooms and the service at the hotel was second to none. Difficult to fault anything about the hotel - five stars all round. Special mention to Panagiostis and Vladimir and to the chefs - quality of the food was best in the island and fantastic value for money.",1
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We have stayed at many top hotels around the world and felt that this one was among the best we have ever stayed. The service was flawless. From the incredible breakfasts served within 5 minutes of your call to them on your private terrace with unrivaled views to the wonderful staff that will go out of their way to make sure that every moment of your stay with them is top notch. The restaurant is delicious with local products and the wait staff were knowledgeable and attentive. The pool area is gorgeous and fun and the rooms were spectacular - comfortable, quiet, with stylish and beautiful decor. The Wifi was excellent both in your room, on your terrace and in the public areas of the hotel. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",1
"If you're looking to be pampered ,treated like royalty in addition to breathtaking daytime nighttime and sunset views This is the place for you ! Friendly , efficient and personalized service . Be prepared to walk and go up the stairs . Make sure you emphasize any leg or knee problems when reserving to ensure minimum climbing possible although some of this is inevitable . Walking trail to Fira , great public bus service .",0
"Trying to work out when we can return. Had deluxe cave room which was lovely, own patio, fab views. Staff couldn't be more accommodating. Breakfasts to die for served outside room on patio - fresh fruits, yoghurt, pastries. We ate in hotel each evening as this was a lazy holiday for us to get away from a busy life - but why not when the food was all fresh ingredients and so lovely. Brilliant for a short stay - we stayed 3 nights which was not quite enough for us. Note there are a number of steps and some are steep so you need to be aware of that but in fairness Santorini is like that anyway.   Room Tip: Deluxe rooms were lovely See more room tips",0
"A magical spot, a beautiful room and top service. The staff cannot do enough for you, many personal touches have been thought of, also the food is amazing and very reasonably priced. Just a small word to the wise, if you have any walking difficulties this is not the place for you as there is a massive walk up to reception etc though this is just in the nature of the geography it is good to be aware! it saved going to the gym each day anyway :-)",3
The views from this hotel are absolutely beautiful and the service really was outstanding. However we were very disappointed with our room. We booked the €900 a night Caldera suite but it was TINY (barely room to move) and had absolutely no privacy what so ever even on the 'terrace' which was separated from the room by a public walk way. A real shame this wasn't advertised better as the photos are very misleading.,8
"All previous reviews have said it all, but I'll say it too! The Iconic is beautifully situated on the edge of the Caldera, and every room has a perfect view. We stayed in a Grotto Suite (Room ""M""), which had a plunge pool inside. I thought this was a bit weird when I booked the room, but in actuality it is fantastic, and romantic! It isn't a hot tub. The hotel took an old existing cistern and turned it into a pool. The rest of the room was luxurious but simply decorated. But what really makes this hotel special is the service. We were greeted with a big smile by the lovely and beautiful Christine, who expressed concern that we weren't going to make it because our ferry from Mykonos was over an hour late. When was the last time a manager at a hotel worried about your arrival time? The kitchen is ""open,"" meaning you can go right in and speak to the chef about what you want to eat! All of the servers at the restaurant couldn't be more accommodating and nice. I cannot recall the names of the two front desk people in the early evening that booked our dinner reservations, but they too were fantastic. During our short stay, we became very friendly with almost every other couple that was by the pool. Everyone was super friendly and this really enhanced our experience.One last thing. My partner and I are gay, and there wasn't a moment that we felt unwelcome. I wouldn't expect anything less then that at a hotel of this caliber, but you never know, so I'm putting it in black and white! Although we did not stop into any other hotel on Santorini, I can say with a great deal of confidence that this is the best hotel on the island, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",2
"My wife found this little gem by going through tripadvisor reviews. Where were there for 5 days and it was an amazing romantic trip. The hotel was so helpful prior to our trip. We were there to attend a wedding, so they booked a hair appointment for my wife, a good time so she did not have to go too early in the morning but only couple hours prior to the wedding. Arranged transfers and car rental , when we had problems with that car they took care of it immediately. The hotel manager came to personally great us made sure we were taken care of. Amazing guest services! Always attentive and took care of every needs! Even bubble warping my beer purchases for travel! The views were spectacular and our room was very comfortable, we had a private indoor pool (grotto pool suite) and it was a great catalyst for a truly romantic experience! We plan to go back when we do a bigger trip thru Greece. We will defiantely stay there again! Great location, quiet and serene, not the tourist chaos of Oia or Fira.",0
"We had no idea what to expect being our first visit to Santorini. I had read the reviews on here and liked the consistent vibe the place was receiving. I had initially envisaged the hotel being a discrete unit , quietly located and exclusive. It is in fact part of the town occupying the lowest point in the Cliff edge but is cheek by Jowl with other hotels. For this reason we were initially a little disappointed. But in true Aesopian mythology we remained patient and let the magic of the place do its work . We had a Caldera suite which had the best view of any hotel i think i have ever stayed in. On the first morning when we were served our private breakfast it was just purely magical. The staff of the hotel were unobtrusive yet very friendly and helpful. They would bring anything to you at anytime by simply dialling zero! We ate in the restaurant every night which was like home cooking and very intimate and wanted to maximise the opportunity of being in such a lovely placeYou often feel you are the only guests in the hotel. The other hotels on our shortlist would have been in Oia; which i had read was very touristy. We took a look up there and it is indeed the most upscale part of the Island with some gorgeous looking properties but have to say lacked some of the charm of ImerovigliOn out departure day we temporarily had to move to a smaller room much lower down; this had a very different feel and was very much less private and very overlooked by other properties. I would advise if you want to experience the magic, stay at the higher level in a Suite!",4
"To say that the views are breath taking is a given, to say that the area the hotel is located in was a pleasant surprise though - close enough to walk into Thira the capital while far away to feel like you have full privacy.The hotel itself is quite basic all be it in a very classic way. I think it is fair to say that the staff and the views are what make this hotel an unforgettable experience.Also the massage in the spa is the bear ice ever experienced! Thank you to kostas and Christine and Haris in particular for helping us organise our trips during our stay!Would recommend this hotel to anyone during your trip to the island and will most definitely be coming back. The only area of improvement would be the beds - they seem quite old and in some instances not the most comfortable.",0
"We had high expectations for the Iconic based on reviews and found our experience to be more wonderful than anticipated. The location is perfect, views are amazing, hotel is beautiful and relaxing, and the entire staff is friendly and incredibly dedicated to ensuring the optimum experience while visiting Santorini. The review would not be complete without commending the hotel chef. The food was both unique and exceptional. Our private dinners on the terrace overlooking the caldera are unforgettable!",1
"Many of the hotels in the area are beautiful. Great views. Clean rooms, etc. The difference here is the staff and service. Simply a great group of people who are friendly, helpful with recommendations, and altogether welcoming in a way that is more unique than a typical high end hotel. We will return!",2
"Great hotel, wonderful location, stunning views with excellent service. What makes this hotel unique is the great team of staff, from housekeeping to Management. They did everything possible to make this one of the best holidays. The chef prepared fantastic vegetarian meals for us. They accommodated meal times as per our schedule. Some days we had breakfast at midday.Hotel is located in Imerovigili - 20 min walk from Fira and a 10 km from Oia, which are very busy with tourists. It's very peaceful place without the cruise crowds. We will definitely come back to this hotel.",2
"Beautiful setting, amazing service and wonderful meals are my fondest memories of our stay here. Be aware, however of the low ceilings if you are over 6' (as we both are) - you really are in caves!Incomparable sunset views!",1
"Great haven of tranquillity , wonderful views and service to match. The hotels local chef is incredibly talented too. We were able to celebrate a special Anniversary in great style .Very difficult to say goodbye.",1
"Fantastic Hotel, great location, cute perfect nice size rooms, excellent service and great food. Amazing place, could not recommend enough. Stellar on all fronts. Tres Romantic. Walk to Fira but Imerovigli doesn't have the cruise crowds. Views are out of this world and even better than Oia. What a find.",0
"OK, a bit biased with the title since I have not stayed at other properties in Santorini, but the title is based on personal experience only. For several reasons: 1) Service - It starts from airport pick up. They hire third party agent that carry your name at airport. Ride is flawless. No issue about picking up your bags. There is a little walk from main road to your room. Steep steps involved. They handle all that. They have ample staff that walk around all the time without being intrusive but a gentle question, 'can I get you something'. Staff is always smiling and eager to accommodate anything. Extremely pleased with Haris who served us most of our stay including at the restaurant. Yes, that's the best part...they can do ANYTHING. Make you a latte too! The manager is amazing. He likes to make rounds every morning. He will make sure everything goes well. 2) Location. Of course. That's the whole point of Santorini. Depending on which type of room you pick, the view is spectacular. 3) Morning breakfast. There is nothing better than waking up, stepping outside to the gorgeous view, sitting and having a private breakfast. Any kind of eggs. Any kind of coffee. The bread. And what not. So much pampering. 4) Restaurant - Believe it or not they have a darn good cook. You can order anything special so that he can have time to buy ingredients and he will do it for you next day. And pick a seat that's across the water for a lifetime of memories.   Room Tip: It involves some steep step climbing so consider that in your decision. See more room tips",2
"If you want the quintessential Santorini experience, stay at the Iconic. We felt transported into another dimension. Our family of four (two teenage girls) enjoyed our five days here immensely. The staff couldn't do enough for us. They arranged massages for my daughter and I in their spa room with two very experienced massage therapists. They also booked a private catamaran for us with an outstanding crew. The food was delicious. Breakfast was delivered to our terrace every morning at the time of our choosing. We usually sleep through breakfast so this was very much appreciated! The views of the caldera were absolutely amazing and exactly as depicted on their website. Also, the rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spacious. I am running out of superlatives to describe the Iconic. It was truly special.",1
We spent three nights here on our honeymoon and the experience was flawless. Beautifully appointed rooms with semi-private deck space to bask in the incredible views that Santornini is known for. The service and all the staff were wonderful and the food fantastic (and very reasonably priced). Thank you Iconic for sharing your slice of perfection!,0
"Before going to Santorini I stressed myself out looking at hotel after hotel until I chose Iconic. I was really worried that all of the great reviews just couldn't be true. Much to my delight they were all true and then some! Our stay at Iconic was flawless. We went to Santorini for a wedding and even before arriving, Iconic helped us arrange hair appointments, smart car rentals and prebooked taxis to make sure we were on time for everything. From the moment we arrived at hotel reception with welcome drinks until the moment we departed with a big hug from our favorite hotel staff member Panagiota- we felt like we were at home and our every need & desires were catered to. Our Grotto suite was beautifully appointed with a large indoor jacuzzi/pool, comfy beds, Aesop toiletries, loofahs and much more! We had a bottle of champagne, fresh fruit & greek sweets upon arrival to our room. Our balcony had the most amazing views and we could have spent the enitre stay there if we hadnt had a wedding to attend and sights to see! Breakfast on our balcony every morning was a real treat!! The hotel pool and restaurant were lovely. We would order our food and then have a swim while waiting for it to be ready and take in the views. The food was very good and the only rival while we were there was Selene Restaurant (also booked for us by Iconic). They even helped us wrap fragile items for packing- no request was too much for them! When we were out and about we would call the hotel and they would recommend restaurants etc.ALL of the Staff were attentive, helpful, friendly and just genuinely nice people! I must give special mention to Panagiota & Yiannis who really went out of their way to make our stay amazing! We will most definitely go again! We will choose a room with an outdoor pool/jacuzzi this time to enjoy the views even more. I also highly recommend choosing a higher room near reception if you have difficulty climbing stairs.   Room Tip: all room spectacular but if have problem climbing stairs ask for higher floor near reception See more room tips",1
"We stayed at the Iconic Santorini for several days in early June 2015. Our room was small and literally a cave built into the side of the volcano that is Santorini, but well appointed, and as soon as we stepped outside the view was breathtaking. The amenities (Aesop creams etc) , linens, turn down service and little desserts left every night were greatly enjoyed and appreciated. We had a private pool that was neither warm nor cold, and was really for dunking not for swimming. Breakfast each morning was overlooking the magnificence that is Santorini. The best part of all is the service - attentive, friendly, always available and simply marvelous. Lunch and dinner, had by us in their small but beautiful restaurant overlooking the sea, (and of course the breakfast that was part of our package), was first rate. We had many opportunities to chat with the proprietor and manager, and their philosophy is - you pay a handsome sum for the room so we won't nickel and dime you on food, bottled water, etc. - and true to their word, they did not. This was a birthday trip so my husband and my friend, who was with us along with her husband also celebrating a special birthday, planned the trip with the assistance of a travel agent so I have no idea what we actually paid, but whatever it was - it was worth it! Gorgeous hotel and breath-taking views from every angle. A few notes - if you have any type of aversion to stairs, or if you have any physical issues that prevent you from going up and down steep, uneven stairs - this place is not for you. I feel for the guys who shouldered our luggage up and down a great many steep stairs in the hot sun. Our friends had a slightly bigger room and their ""pool"" was inside their room- it too was neither a hot tub nor a cold dunking pool, and they felt it was a waste and never used it. No actual swimming pools are allowed on the side of the cliffs of Santorini (they are ""fountains"") and the hotel had such a fountain that we went in several times- not to swim but to cool off. All in all- definitely recommend.   Room Tip: If climbing stairs is an issue, contact the hotel for advice on the most appropriate room See more room tips",1
"The Iconic is nothing less than amazing. We just got back from a 4 night stay and it could not have been better. The staff is beyond courteous ( a shout out to Wladimir and Christine) and goes out of their way to make your stay perfect. The memory of a dreamy view, plus the Greek breakfast outside our rooms every morning, served with freddo capuccinos is making our return to real life harder :)!I have to point out that our 5:30am check out had a porter promptly waiting outside our rooms , a desk receptionist on call and lovely sandwiches packed for the road. Thank you, Iconic staff, you are the best.Needless to say that If you ever go to Santorini, this is the place to stay.",1
"We stayed at the Iconic hotel between 27th May- 6th June in a Caldera Suite and it's safe to say we had an amazing time. We were whisked straight to the hotel from the airport in a luxury transfer where we were met in the square by staff who took our luggage and escorted us to a lounge area outside the gym where welcome drinks and reception team were there to meet us. Following a short rest and a drink we were taken to what can only be described as a beautiful suite, with perfect views over the Caldera and views of the cruise ships which we enjoyed watching daily. We had our own terrace with chairs and table for breakfast, 2 very comfortable sun loungers and our own jacuzzi. The facilities in the room, from Aesop toiletries to the amazingly comfortable Cocomat bed are second to none. Water and ice was provided all day in our room and refreshed each time the room was serviced (twice a day). We could have as much water and soft drinks as we liked and the kind waiters regularly stopped by and asked if they could bring anything. Throughout our stay we ate out of the hotel on 3 occasions which although the sunset is beautiful, we couldn't find food or service to match the hotel so chose to stay in the other evenings. The food is different every night and freshly prepared by chef Kostas who is undoubtedly extremely talented and passionate about his work. He often asked for feedback and if you fancied something not on his menu he would always endevour to provide it for you. The food is also really reasonably priced. Lunches were also really good and again offered specials as well as salads and sandwiches. Breakfast was delivered to our room every morning at our terrace as soon as we rang to say we were ready. We usually chose what we wanted the night before from an extensive list. Again if there's something you fancy they will try their best to make it for you.We were lucky enough to celebrate our wedding at the hotel and the whole team made sure all our wishes (and more) came true. Demetris in particular made a big effort to keep our party happy and kept things running smoothly. We were offered a night in the Iconic Suite on the night of our wedding which I have to say is outstanding should you be lucky enough to stay there. We can't thank Vella and his whole team enough for making it so special for us and being so accomodating.We also took advantage of a couple of massages at the hotel and reception helped us organise a VIP tour of the island one afternoon which was also really great.In summary, the team at this hotel will do anything they can to help you enjoy what will be a really special trip to Santorini, whether a holiday or a more special trip.Thank you again,Sally & Charlie   Room Tip: Caldera suite on the same level as the restaurant was perfect and the night in the Iconic Suite was... See more room tips",2
"From the first stunning impact of the views over the caldera, this hotel does not disappoint! Service is second to none, with all members of staff smiling and keen to please. Every part of the hotel is 'cool' and comfortable. Fellow guests were there for exactly the same reason as us - 'to chill.' If you want a busy bar and to mix then this hotel is not for you - drinks are served on your own terrace. Local produce is delicious and you will not get better food anywhere on the island. A supremely romantic experience.",3
"Straight to the point - this is a totally unique hotel on a special island which is a very good start. Add a commitment by absolutely every member of staff to provide first class service complemented by fabulous cuisine, an outstanding housekeeping regime and you will start to get a measure of this boutique hotel. Read the other reviews about the views and aura of the island as they are all correct; the island is stunning.Back to the hotel - we booked through British Airways. It was not cheap by any means but it suited our requirements and in retrospect was worth it. Remember that Thira Airport is limited in its facilities so do not expect too much on your inbound journey.More good points about the hotel - it would be easy to list individual members of staff and how they made their mark but this is probably incongruous as all were so kind and committed. One person does however need to be named - Kostas the Chef. He is the most modest person you will meet but has an amazing knowledge of local produce and an incredible ability to use this to present attractive and delicious fare.All that needs to be said really is 'Go and enjoy and very special experience on a very special island'. The staff will ensure you have a memorable trip.   Room Tip: All have private terraces for eating out and sunbathing and the most fabulous views. Whichever room... See more room tips",5
"Once we caught our first sight of the caldera vistas and were warmly greeted by Dimitiris the Resident Manager ( who bounded nimbly down the steep stairs laden with both of our heavy suitcases - one on his shoulder - with a smile ) we entered another dimension of leisure and enjoyment. The vistas are obviously natural and wonderous and provided by someone else, the hotel product was stylish, picturesque and most comfortable, the food was very tasty, market fresh daily and varied ( we only left the Iconic once - to go down to Oia to eat seafood and drink in the sunset ) - courtesy of the Kostas - above all the service was exceptional in the warmth, sincere friendliness, nothing is too much trouble , can do , smiling and most courteous and flexible manner it was delivered by all from Vella - the GM down - including his whole, small but perfectly formed team of superstars , Dimitiris, Panigiota, Yannis, Varis, Vladmiir, Panigiotis, Christina being the ones we had most contact with. When breakfast is available until 12 noon - you know you are in a customer focused hotel.   Room Tip: all views superb See more room tips",1
"I am always suspicious of glowing reviews. Really, is any place that good? The Iconic Santorini exceeded our expectations in every regard. The view of the caldera is stunning, no really, stunning.The grounds. As with just about every hotel room picture ever taken the rooms are smaller than they appear. While on the cozy side the rooms are well appointed with comfortable furniture, especially the bed. The bath is nicely sized with a roomy walk-in shower. Then there is the outside. Depending on the room (ours was a Caldera View) you have a small table for breakfast, two lounge chairs and a Jacuzzi; easily doubling the interior square footage. Everything is kept spotless.The staff. Vella, the GM manages by walking around chatting with guests assuring things running according to plan. Need anything? The girls at the front desk have the answers. All activities were arraigned by the girls and they never steered us wrong. Service is never far away, from a cool drink to a delicious meal. Never once encountered someone who was having a bad day.“Free breakfast” usually means unsatisfying food. Not so at this hotel. It takes surprisingly little time to become accustomed to pushing “0” and having a made to order fresh breakfast appear on your porch overlooking the caldera. A first for us was Chef Kostas. He actively sought us out to see what should be served for dinner. The kitchen will prepare any dish for which fresh ingredients can be found. Find out what is fresh and have chef prepare to his liking, you will not be disappointed.The hotel is positioned well, a 30 minute walk to Fira and a 20 minute cab ride to Oia. Both are nice places to shop but can get a little crowded if several cruise ships are in port. It’s a good idea to count the cruise ships at anchor while enjoying breakfast on the porch. More than three; stay away from town.The sunset cruise was especially nice. Seeing the island from the sea is special. Arrange (through the front desk of course) for a small boat. Toured one winery and enjoyed it. There is a three winery tour that is supposed to give a great view of the island from the land side. The ruins were nice as well.Our stay was delightful. The staff took a beautiful location and made it as good as it gets.",1
"My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights on our honeymoon, and from our arrival, our treatment exceeded our wildest expectation. Antonis, his family and the entire staff made sure that we wanted for absolutely nothing while we were on the island. The recommendations for meals and activities were exactly what we were hoping for, and everyone treated us as long-lost friends. It was one of the most welcoming groups of people my wife and I have encountered in our travels together.The hotel itself is beautiful, and centrally located to a number of wonderful restaurants in Oia. Made-to-order breakfasts (so good) on our private balcony gave us plenty of time to take in an amazing view of the coastline during the morning as well as providing us a great spot to open a bottle of wine in the evening. Honestly, if you are traveling to Oia, you would be remiss if you passed up the opportunity to stay here. My wife and I have only great things to say about our experience at Filotera, and we can't wait to make it back there some day.",0
"Just returned from a fabulous stay at this very unique residence. Thanks to Adonis, Margarita and Nikos who looked after our every need, not that we had many, as they literally had everything covered. Breakfast delivered to your balcony each day with a view over the sea to the Volcanos, will be a treat to remember. My husband had his birthday whilst we were there and not only did Nikos book our table at the Katharos Lounge, he drove us there and picked us back up !! We were also surprised with a glass of champagne and a birthday cake whilst sunning ourselves by the pool. Room was very clean and quirky as built into the cliff edge. No bath but free mini bar. Quite often had little treats left at bedtime and details of the weather for the following day. And if that is not enough to tempt you don't forget most of the 8 rooms comes with your own personal spar pool on the balcony !!!!",0
What a beautiful hotel and family we have stayed at the best hotels around the world but nothing can compare to the filters suites! The family are lovely and went above and beyond anything we asked! The massage in the room overlooking the caldera and the breakfasts was amazing and exceeded anything we have had in London. The room was spotless and amazing service from everyone! If you want the best of the best in santorini you must stay here and experience what me and my wife would say is an indescribable and incredible experience! Stay at the best the Filotera Suites!!!,0
"Amazing hosts, great private balconies, and incredible views!! I stayed here for three nights with my husband on our honeymoon. We loved the private hot tub on our private balcony. We also enjoyed the pool area. The Filotera Suites are in a great location for all the walking sights in Oia.",0
"We stayed in a cave room with a private plunge pool. The room was clean and modern, and truly captured the essence of Oia. Margarita and Nico were incredible, catering to any need and making your feel like you are a part of the family. The main pool and hottub were very nice and well maintained. We went in May, and they weather was warm, but not too hot. It was a great time to visit before tourism is in full swing. The breakfast is beyond amazing, cooked to order and delievered to your balcony so that you can enjoy an incredible view of the caldera. I cannot say enough great things about the breakfast- some of the best that I have ever had and do not miss the Nutella crepes!As my husband and I talk about where we are headed to next- we can't get past going back to Oia and staying at Filotera Suites again. It was an unforgettable experience!",0
"My husband and I spent the last part of our honeymoon here and we agree that it was the most spectacular place of all! Margarita, Nico, and Adonis are extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile. They made car rental arrangements for us, dinner reservations, and recommended the best beach on the island (Perivolos). They also set up the amazing yachting experience for us - the highlight of our honeymoon! The breakfast is INCREDIBLE! The way it is presented and the authentic and quality taste of the food, not to mention the absolutely breathtaking view, is enough for it to be unforgettable. This is a very reliable and lovely place to stay. I can't recommend it highly enough!",0
"We stayed in this hotel for one night. Our room was next too the pool.. And we had a private hot tube. From the pool their is a fantastic view!!! one thing disturb Me was the fact that we found a had hair under the cover of our bed. But everything in the room was clean, Including the sheets. The staff was very friendly.",0
"After three very long flights, my husband and I were greeted right out of the cab by the owner of the the Filotera Suites. She escorted us up the stairs right into perfection. Words do not express the stunning view, the attention to detail, the ultra clean hotel, the professional and attentive staff. I've stayed in many places and I'm picky about three things: location, service and cleanliness. Filotera Suites surpass every experience. The family owners express professionalism yet were warm and welcoming. Every staff member showed sincere happiness, which made a huge impact. The grounds were exceptionally clean, ultra clean and bright. I found no dirt ever...anywhere (I always look). And the breakfast.....amazing! We have been home for two weeks and I can still picture that view in the morning....freshly delivered, delicious food sitting in front of the most stunning water. Yep, perfection. We are planning a family trip and we will most definitely be staying at Filotera Suites!",0
"Loved loved loved filotera suites. Have stayed in hundreds of hotels at all price points all over the world and this was one of the best 5 lifetime experiences. Exceptional combination of room quality, service and location. Filotera has been run by a family for 20+ years and it shows - they love what they do and care a great deal about their guests. There are only 8 rooms so you feel very pampered. The views across the Santorini caldera from anywhere on the property are breathtaking. My impression is that many hotels in Oia probably offer a generally similar experience but I'd be surprised if any do it as well as Filotera - there is a reason they are voted number 1 on tripadvisor. Thank you, it was really special",0
"This was one of the best hotels that I have stayed in with such friendly staff, nice facilities, and a beautiful view of oia. It is a family run boutique hotel, and I often felt that I was more or less hosted by a family by the friendliness and helpfulness. They gave great recommendations for food, helped us make reservations, and checked in to make sure that everything was taken care of and that we felt right at home. The added inclusive mini bar, welcome drinks, and sweets were a plus! I also loved that they serve breakfast in the patio (or by the pool) by taking the breakfast order the day before. It is amazing to wake up to an incredible spread of a variety of breakfast foods of your choice.",0
"We booked 5 nights of our honeymoon here based on the reviews on trip advisor and I have to say this place lives up to its ranking of number one in Oia. Wish we would have stayed longer and spent one less night in Athens. I can usually find some fault or weakness with a hotel, but everything at Filotera was flawless, from the room (stayed in the more expensive Patitiri honeymoon suite - well worth the up charge for the added privacy) to the service and staff to the amenities. They don't have a restaurant, but have a kitchen that serves up great breakfasts (complimentary) and lunches, but this is not an issue as there are numerous places for dinner nearby off the pedestrian walkway along the volcano rim that serves as a reason to go off property. The pool never feels crowded as there are only about 10 rooms. Located in Oia, a town which is really nice and quiet at night and perfect for couples. Filotera is located in the nicest section of the caldera. We will definitely come back one day.",0
"We spend our 19 days honeymoon trip in Greece and France, stay in many hotels, and this is the best one. The hotel has nice view, good location and friendly owner and staffs. The owner gave us a warm welcoming and all the staffs are always with smile. The room is very beautiful with champagne and flowers. The owner hasn’t told us but we think our room had been upgrade to a bigger one. The breakfast on our balcony with the Aegean Sea is the best. Spending all day on the balcony to enjoy the sunshine and the beautiful sea view is the most relaxing thing. The most pity thing is we stay here for one night only. I’m sure we will visit Santorini again as it is an amazing island, and we definitely will stay in this hotel again!",0
You can stay in many 5 star hotels in Santorini but this hotel has the best family on charge.We loved the rooms and the family who owns the hotel.We do recomend here to everyone.We will be back next year.,2
"There is no point in re-stating all the positive aspects detailed in previous reviews but I can wholeheartedly endorse all of them. We had a good large room with a private outside area and small heated swimming pool. Unlike in many other hotels visited there was never any competition for the sunloungers and there was always a helpful attendant available to move the parasols as necessary. We had to climb 75 steep steps and some would find this difficult. However, this may well be common in this resort. Breakfast and food generally were excellent and the free mini-bar was a welcome touch. The air conditioning worked well and was reasonably quiet. We have travelled extensively for over 60 years and have never been looked after better or by a more charming and friendly family.   Room Tip: Superior rooms are best but there may be many stairs to climb See more room tips",3
"I had a wonderful stay at Filotera Suites. The owner and his daughter were so welcoming and lovely and made the stay so enjoyable!! The made recommendations on where to visit, gave me a map, and were extremely helpful with all of my needs.Breakfast is serve on your front patio as you look over the Aegean Sea. It is the perfect view and so pleasant, quiet and lovely. The food was amazing and plentiful for breakfast.The outdoor hot tub on my patio was great way to just relax, be outside, but also have my own space!The hotel is a bit hard to find from the street as it's directly front facing the Caldera, but the owner was more than happy to come down to escort me to the front. After that, it's a piece of cake to navigate. It truly is a lovely boutique hotel that is very attentive to your needs. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",1
"We stayed for 4 nights in July 2015 after researching every property in Santorini. Filotera suites was beyond every expectation. The room, the service, location, food, everything was absolute perfection. We stayed in the Patitiri suite (cave suite with private jacuzzi) but I don't think you can go wrong anywhere. My boyfriend and I joked we'll never be able to take a honeymoon - this was better than anything we can imagine!",1
"Filotera Suites has an absolutely breathtaking view. It sits in the middle of Oia, and from every room you are able to see the entire caldera. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite for a family of four, and had a pool as well. It was secluded from the rest of the suites which was nice to have privacy while being so open. The service here was exceptional. We ate breakfast here every morning; we had to put in our order from their menu and it was delivered to our room promptly at the time we asked. The staff, especially the family, were all incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The accommodations were easily made; we had a car one day of our trip handled through Filotera, and we went to all the places (beach and dining) that they suggested - and all were fantastic. The experience at Filotera suites was unforgettable a truly a little taste of heaven!   Room Tip: best views and amazing service See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Filotera for four nights and we had the time of our lives.Starting with the warm reception, the Family made us feel right at home. The room was perfect, well decorated and very peaceful. This was by far the best Hotel we have ever stayed at. No room for improvement. The breakfast was delicious. We can't wait until our next visit. As far as we're concerned, Filotera is the only place to stay when you re in Santorini!",2
"Filotera Suites is by far one of the best places to stay in Santorini. We will definitely be back next year!We booked the hotel after reading reviews online and were not disappointed. Everything from the location, to the rooms/amenities, to the staff are just incredible. Filotera Suites is small and private, yet also located right on the pedestrian street, so it meets the needs of those looking for a getaway or seeking direct access to the stores, restaurants and cafes in Oia. The family who runs the hotel are absolute gems. They make you feel so cared for and comfortable. They are willing to help you with any travel arrangements and miraculously get it done with very little time. Everyone who works at Filotera Suites was kind, courteous, attentive, and always had a smile on their face.In addition to the staff, the rooms and the amenities, the food at Filotera Suites is incredible! You can't beat a custom breakfast on your private terrace every morning. The quality and the quantity of food was spectacular.We will definitely be staying at Filotera Suites again!   Room Tip: All of the rooms are amazing and have spectacular views. You can't go wrong! See more room tips",0
"Fantastic, breathe taking views of the Caldera. We had an infinityPool outside our room that appeared to poor into the Agean Sea.Margarita and her whole family could not have been nicer or moreaccommodating. This was by far the nicest place we stayed on our Greecetrip.",0
"We stayed in one of the cave rooms, which had the most spectacular view from front patio. Each room has a view, and it's own jacuzzi. The reception area is lovely, and the pool offers cocktails and food. It's a small, clean, lovely boutique hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful on recommendations for dinner, etc.The hotel is fantastic, and for the price the only things I didn't love were that the rooms have no windows (in fairness, it's meant to be a cave room, but little natural light, and low ceilings), and the private jacuzzi is not too private, as guests walk right in front of each room, so it's very tight quarters). It was fine for me, as we had our daughter with us, but I felt bad for the honeymooners who I know paid a lot for their rooms.",0
Made a trip advisor account just so I could mention how amazing this hotel was. From the moment we walked in we were treated with the utmost respect and the best service. The breakfast was beautiful and served on our private balcony. Rooms were immaculate and there was a never ending supply of towels (which I loved). Each night we were left with a little sweet treat in our room. The views from the hotel are surreal and so was the hotel pool. Thank you for an amazing stay.,0
"Stunning location and views of the caldera from the hotel.Hot tub cave room highly recommended.Hotel staff was superb right from the manager to the cleaners everyone was super helpful and prompt.Joseph the server, deserves a special mention.Enjoyed the breakfast immensely.Can't ask for more!!!!!Superb place!!!!",0
"Filotera is a small , family run boutique hotel in the heart of Oia. The views from any room are just amazing ! The staff is super friendly ! The rooms are traditional within Santorini style of caves. Super comfy beds and bed linen (gets changed daily). Soft cotton towels in the bathroom. Air com in the bedrooms and a hot tub outside overlooking the sea. Wifi is free at the hotel. They have a car park just down the road free of charge when you visited. Breakfast has different options , I loved the greek breakfast with special omelette. You choose the time for your breakfast to be served at your balcony. There is a swimming pool ,I'm not sure if is heated and a small bar beside the pool. We rented a car and travel around the island seem different things everyday. Within walking distance from the hotel you can find a number of restaurants , diverse cuisine and price budgets.The only thing I didnt like was lack of privacy ! There is a ""high street"" behind/above the hotel where people stop all day long to take photos and depending where you're, the cameras will be pointing at you ! Well, you can feel like a celebrity for the time you'll be spending at Filotera.   Room Tip: I believe all rooms are good at Filotera See more room tips",0
"One of the most magical experiences of my life! Santorini has been on my bucket list for quite awhile so I did a lot of research before booking our hotel and am so so happy that we went with Filotera Suites! The rooms were beautiful and the fact that they are built into the side of the mountain makes them so unique. The views were unbelievable and we enjoyed our personal hot tub each day we were there. From our private terrace we ate the amazing breakfast that was included in the price of the room. We are big foodies and the fact that we got to select what we wanted, and that it was all so delicious, really made us never want to leave! All the employees were helpful, friendly and always wanted to ensure that everything was just how we wanted it. We were already talking about a return trip while still there and will most definitely be staying here again!!!",0
"Incredible location and service!! Small family run boutique hotel, very nicely decorated and with superb friendly service from everyone. Great views, incredible breakfasts on your own terrace, an oasis just off the busy promenade in Oia.",1
"Filotera Suites is a greeat small family run hotel in the beautiful pituresque village of Oia , the hotel only has eight suite but everything about it is amazing , the staff are friendly and attentive and Margarete & Antonis the owners son & Daughter will do everything possible to make you stay a wonderful experience , the rooms are extremely clean (towels are changed twice per day) the breakfast is excellent and served in your room or on your varanda , they also provide excellent snaks during the day . Antonis & Margarete can arrange restaurants , site seeing trips , boat trips , nothing is too much trouble , I would without question recommend this hotel to anyone   Room Tip: The are all excellent although some are larger than others See more room tips",0
"This place is an absolute must for staying in Oia. A bit pricey, but worth every penny for the incomprehensible views and incredible customer service. Our whole stay felt like a dream. We had an activity planned one day but ended up cancelling and just lounging around the pool and ordering room service - because the views and the amenities are just that good! Its perfectly located for most shopping and activities in Oia, too. I will be sending all my family and friends here. Book it, you wont regret!   Room Tip: Their lot is near impossible to find. Best to park in a public lot until you can check in and they c... See more room tips",0
"This hotel is the best, from the staff to the room and the view, everything is just best!The view from the room is fantastic! I assure you this is the view you dream for.The staffs are so good and helpful. Got a lot of recommendations and advices from the staff! Thumbs Up!The breakfast is delicious and great! Finally the room is so comfortable. This is a small luxury hotel where you able to just stay inside the hotel for the whole day yet not getting bored, the view and service are just too good to be real. Look no further if you want to stay in Oia, this is just perfect! Staying in this hotel is the best part of my Santorini trip! Definitely will come back here again.   Room Tip: Honeymoon Cave Suites is perfect for couple, the size is just nice. The view is manigficient. See more room tips",0
"What can i say about this amazing and unique place ! Beauty in every detail , great staff and welcoming always gave us great insides and recommendations on the island ! The location is in the centre of the BEAUTIFUL and breathtaking Oia ! I just loved my laid back relaxing time on this unique place ! 6 star from me !",0
We booked Filotera suites after a friend recommended it. They must have renovated it recently because everything is very clean and new. Our room was amazing - with a heated pool and an amazing view of the caldera. Antonis and Magerita were very hospitable and friendly and had some amazing recommendations for us for restaurants and planning our trip around Santorini. The service was impeccable with good toiletries and room service twice a day. Breakfast was amazing with lots of choices and they were accommodating enough to get me soy milk. I would highly recommend Filotera suites! Staying here definitely added a magical touch to our visit to Santorini.,0
"Me and my husband had such a wonderful time here, Anthoni was so welcoming and helpful with everything we needed. The view was amazing! The room was amazing! The breakfast was amazing! We really never wanted to leave here. I definitely recommend Filotera to everyone staying in Oia.",0
"Thank you Antonis and family for the most perfect stay in Santorini. We were warmly welcomed, shown the most perfect romantic clean room, minibar was included in the cost, turndown service and maid service while we were out, massive beautiful delicious champagne breakfast served on our private patio, and most of all the most beautiful view. The staff were professional, friendly and we will definitely be back. Filotera is worth every euro you spend, and the staff, service, and surroundings is worth my effort in reviewing on Tripadvisor. Thank you thank you for a perfect romantic getaway",0
"Wow. We just returned home from a 7 night Santorini stay, 4 of those nights were at Filotera Suites in the Honeymoon suite. All we can keep saying is Wow! Antonio greeted us with such warmth and honest gratitude it was heartwarming! Wine and chocolate while they took our bags to the room and a full overview of the island and towns. After this to our room, where a bottle of Nikos (the father and owner) wine was waiting us. Such a special space, very newly renovated and modern but very comfortable. The view... To die for, Santorini to a T. After unpacking to the pool it was where Chris and the boys did an amazing job pampering us. What a great area the pool is just perfect. Back to the room where a bottle of Champagne and a beautiful fruit plate were waiting for us, this after Chris's raki offering too. This night we went out to dinner and met Margarita (Sister) on the way out, very friendly and helpful. We met Nikos as well. The family run aspect is so nice to see and feel. The next morning breakfast is set up on the patio at our specified time and it is outstanding! No details spared here. Presentation alone was worth it. More champagne and pool time. All i can say is that we traveled from Hawaii (the other paradise) with high hopes and expectations and not only were they met but totally exceeded. If you don't stay here you are doing your Oia trip a disservice. Again, the property is AMAZING but what really stood out for us was the service and people, genuine and professional. Thank you so much for nailing our special time. We will be back",0
"The best of all ... the hosts, Anthony and Margerita were wonderful . Welcomed us with their homemade beautiful local wine .Everyday was special here . Starting with a complimentary wine bottle and beautiful flowers as we were on our honeymoon , all inclusive minibar, stunningly tasty breakfast , the hot tub outside the room , the view of the caldera, everything was spot on. The hosts very well guided us how to roam around santorini . A very romantic atmosphere . The cleaning staff is working continiously and also the room service is perfect they even do it twice a day without request .It is advisable to rent a car at the airport at approx 20€ a day and a refuel of 10€ is sufficient for about 90 kms . All driving licences are accepted here even right hand drive . its convinient to see santorini if u have ur own vehicle the island from end to end is 28 kms .",0
"We stayed 4 days in Filotera Suites. It is located next to the main street in Oia. The hotel is family run and the service is great. We had a room next to the pool, where the view is stunning. The breakfast is amazing, you can choose between 4 styles from continental to Greek. We also had lunch several times from the pool bar. Great food as well. In short we can really recommend this place!",0
"This hotel was the biggest splurge for our stay in Santorini and well worth every cent! We were welcomed warmly with a glass of red wine and some chocolates. As our room was not ready, we left our bags at the reception and went out for a walk. When we came back, our bags were already brought to the room. Good service! After a short tour, we promptly jumped into the hot tub. The view was awesome. The bed was comfortable. Toiletries provided was good. The next morning breakfast was not the best I had in Santorini but it came with an awesome view of the caldera. Plus champagne!",0
"Exceptional hospitality on check-in, complete with a drink of traditional Santorini wine and a very informative orientation of all the best places to eat, shop, and gawk at in Oia. The location was excellent, close to but just outside the center of everything, and I loved being able to escape the heaviest crowds and the noise without sacrificing any convenience. My suite was spacious, freshly renovated, immaculately clean, comfortable, and cool-looking. I loved the private terrace, the outdoor private hot tub, the jaw-dropping view of the caldera... Beyond that, the pool area was new, clean, comfortable, with even more stunning views, and the pool bar has great service and some excellent local beers.From the fresh flowers each day to the card on my night table informing me of tomorrow's temperature and humidity, the service was extremely attentive, almost telepathic, without being intrusive. The free breakfast was truly extraordinary, with three different 'themes' (Greek, Continental, or something diet-related), mine included a customized omelette with custom-sweetened Greek coffee (delicious!), and it was set up on my terrace at the exact time I requested (with umbrella positioned perfectly to block the sun).I could go on and on with superlatives about my experience at Filotera Suites, and there's really not a single thing I can think of to criticize. If you're lucky enough to be in Santorini and you're able to book a suite here, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.",0
"We found out about Filotera through Rick Steves. It was an amazing experience!! We stayed in an executive cave suite with private Jacuzzi. The room itself was very nice but the terrace and view were incredible!! The staff were very helpful and attentive and set up a catamaran ride and airport transfer for us as well as giving us great recommendations about restaurants and things to do. I highly recommend the hike from Oia to Imerovigli...it was incredible! We were fortunate to be there in off season when there were great discounts available. Highly recommend, would definitely stay there again if ever back in Santorini!   Room Tip: All the rooms have an incredible view. We had a private Jacuzzi but it is out in the open and other... See more room tips",0
"It has been many months since I came back from Santorini. Just remembered that I owed the family running Filotera a good review. I do quite a lot of traveling, and like good hotels. This one is among the best I've seen. Built into the rock, the room with the pool overlooking the Caldera is super clean, staff very friendly. You won't regret it.",1
Filotera suites is an amazing hotel in a great location. It's like something out of the movies. Perfect for a special occasion!! Amazing views from the hot tub.The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in with the most amazing breakfast and friendliest staff. The staff went out of their way to make it the most perfect trip. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Only very minor negative comment would be that the private hot tubs are private in the sense that they are only for your use but visible from other rooms/outside the hotel.,2
"Adonis and the staff at Filotera were incredibly hospitable and accommodating during our honeymoon in Oia. Room was amazing, just as the pictures showed. Breakfast is a great option to get if you're willing to shell out the extra cash per day. Wifi worked well, cleaned daily. I ended up needing some shaving cream and they actually went out and got it for me :) Overall, excellent hotel and would definitely love to stay again. Thanks Adonis!",3
"Booked a last minute trip and took advantage of their ""honeymoon"" suite special. Parking was a little out of the way, but workable. The room we had was spacious and came with a small hot tub outside. Breakfast was provided in the morning and we were able to enjoy it on the balcony, though it was slightly windy.",3
"Our family of 6 stayed here in 2014 for 4 nights - I waited far to long to write this. We were traveling for 5 weeks throughout Turkey, Greece, and Italy, and this was by far the most beautiful place we stayed. Not only are the rooms beautiful and the view more than you can imagine, but the service provided to us by Nikolas and his family was what sets this place apart from anywhere else. Pay the few dollars extra for breakfast to be served to your on your private little balcony, looking over the sea. My teens especially loved the pool area, to read, sun bathe, and play games. It was breathtaking. And one of my kids had left their retainers at our last stay in Turkey, so we had asked them to mail them to us as Filotera. When our last day came, the retainers still hadn't arrived. so we had to depart for the airport without them. After we left, the small package came, and Nikolas actually DROVE our package to the airport, and found us to give it to us!!!! We were in disbelief. Their family is the most kind, generous, and helpful that you can imagine, and they are what makes Filotera so special. Don't hesitate to stay here...you won't be disappointed!",3
"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for a few days in mid-October as a short break. We stayed in the Lino Suite which was one of the more smaller rooms in the 8-bedroom complex. We were welcomed with wine and chocolates and had a free mini-bar with a selection of drinks upon arrival. The room itself was extremely well taken care of. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. My girlfriend, being quite fussy was very pleased with the quality of toiletries that were provided. These included various hair products, body lotions and even makeup wipes.There was a router in our room which provided fast and reliable wifi 24/7 which was convenient as we had brought our laptop so we could work whilst we were there.The views of the Caldera were spectacular, although to view the sunset you'd have to walk further into the town. Each evening we chose a breakfast from the menu and the time and place where we would like to enjoy it in the morning. The breakfast was by far the best we've ever had at any other hotel and the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful! The location of the hotel was just at the entrance of Oia which was convenient and easy to find. The journey from the airport took only around half an hour which wasn't too bad at all considering the beautiful views that we saw along the way.We don't usually tend to visit the same place twice and stay at the same hotel but in this case we will definitely be returning! I would highly recommend this hotel, especially to couples wanting a relaxing break!!   Room Tip: All rooms have amazing views! See more room tips",5
"One of the best places we've ever stayed at! Aside from the beautiful location and stunning property, the amazing breakfast served on our patio every morning and the hospitality of the staff really stood out. We felt like we were part of the family and were sad to leave!",0
"If you are looking for a hotel in Oia, see no more, Filotera is definitely one of the best. It is just near the begining entrance of Oia. The staff are superb , helpful and very friendly, there are not many units in this but it is just nice and with the breakfast served in front of your room, what else could we ask for more! it is a hotel you should not miss with superb Caldera sea view too !",1
"5* Accommodation and 5*Service provided by the family Nikos and their staff in the authentic yet luxurious cave houses, spotlessly clean with daily changed bed linen, towels, refilled toiletries and free mini bar, and really comfy bed and pillows. The location is absolutely perfect, providing the most beautiful views we have ever had, both from our balcony and from the pool area. The sun loungers were most comfortable, perfect for nodding off !! Such a quiet and relaxing environment - watch the cruise ships sail in and out of the port. A magnificent landscape, just like a picture postcard, I still carry the views in my mind !! The welcome breakfast delivered to your balcony every morning with whatever of your choosing was absolutely delicious and plenty of it. We stayed here for 10 nights and felt part of the family when we left !! Nothing was too much trouble for them, they were all so kind, helpful and friendly as were all the staff. A very personal service with much attention to detail was greatly appreciated and made our holiday a wonderful experience. Walk into Oia with an abundance of boutique shops and lovely restaurants, saunter and mingle amongst the crowd to watch the most stunning sunset each evening - such an amazing sight ! The convenient bus station will take you anywhere on the island, including Fira, the capital, where a visit is highly recommended - see the donkeys - take the cable car.Thank you so much - we loved Filotera and Oia - only wish I was back there !   Room Tip: All rooms have fantastic views ! See more room tips",2
This is an excellent family run hotel. All the rooms have great ocean view. The owners are very friendly and helpful. You order the breakfast from a menu and it will be served in your room or the balcony.   Room Tip: Try selecting a room at a higher elevation (the rates may vary based on the elevation).

"Fabulous location and family run suites . Nicos , Adonis and Margarita were the perfect hosts and nothing was too much trouble for them, Nicos even gave us a lift in his car to Fira one day.The views are breathtaking , suites are modern and charming, we stayed in Patitiri which was perfect, they all looked great but Patitiri is at the top and views are stunning.Breakfasts are plentiful and we could stroll into Oia for evening meals . We also walked down the steps a few days to the harbour below to swimin the ocean which was beautiful.Thankyou Nicos and family for a wonderful week.   Room Tip: All good Patitiri stood on it own so is secluded See more room tips",0
We loved every minute of our stay! This is a family owned hotel and it shows in every area through the pride they take in their property. Beautiful rooms amazing service great location. Meticulous attention to detail. The owner and his son offered the best service we've ever had. I can't imagine finding a better spot to stay in Santorini!,0
"Just finished a 5 night stay at the Filotera and we could not have imagined a better experience. Nikos, Margarita and Adonis give Four Seasons service in an intimate family atmosphere. The locations, rooms, pool, breakfast and true concierge services set this hotel apart. They not only offered to arrange everything from car rentals, to dinner reservations, but genuinely seemed so happy to help make our vacation as great as possible. I have stayed at high end resorts and boutiques all over the world, and Filotera is as good as it gets. My wife and I could not have been happier and can not wait to return.",0
This hotel is as good as all the reviews. The hotel is ideally located for the shops and the view is just amazing. The breakfast is set up outside your room each morning and all the staff greet you with a friendly smile and conversation. Sitting on your balcony with such a breathtaking view is something we will never forget. Rooms are clean and very comfortable and well maintained. What does make the difference is Nikos and his family Margarita and Adonis (ask him where to eat ....you will not be disappointed.) Every meeting with them was a pleasure and they really could not have done any more for us including two trips to restaurants! We were very sad to go and the hugs we received upon departure sets this place apart. Stay here you will not be disappointed. We can't wait to go back!   Room Tip: All rooms have an excellent view. There are a number of steps n to the pool and rooms so speak to ho... See more room tips,0
"we spent one week there and our stay was so great ! Delicious breakfast every morning in front of the sea, helpful staff, perfect location in Oia. we truly recommend this hotel for family or couples !",0
"our experience at Filotera Suites was above 5 stars. The privately owned hotel is run by the nicest, most helpful family and staff. The property is beautiful and spotlessly kept. The rooms are the typical cave rooms with modern bathrooms. Each room has a private outdoor patio/ balcony with an amazing, picture perfect view. Breakfast is delivered to each room and set up so that you can eat in your private balcony. I will absolutely be back - this time for longer!",0
My Husband and I planned this trip for our anniversary getaway. This hotel was amazing! It wasn't only the location that was ideal but the people who worked and owned the place were absolutely delightful. Everything was picture prefect andI would come back again and again. I recommend this hotel 100%.,0
"The people, the place, the hotel, the view.... were perfect.Nicely renovated recently the small hotel is in the heart of the village. The rooms-caves are easily accessible and the modern minimamistic decoration goes perfect with the white and blue Oia. The owner, Mt Nikos and his daugther Margarita and son Antonis are omnipresent when you need a service or information. Polite, friendly and efficient deserve also a ""five star"" rating. The same with the other personnel, Leonidas, Thanassis, the cleaning lady and Mrs Maria who prepared 4 varieties of perfect breakfast! I can only recommend this property for any traveler to Santorini.",0
We stayed here for only three nights at the end of our month holiday through Turkey and Greece and how I wished we could have stayed longer. Nothing was to much trouble for this wonderful family run hotel. I will be back again and will be staying longer.,0
"Me and my family stayed for two nights at this wonderful place on July. The hotel location is perfect; good restaurants and shops are nearby and it has the best view in Santorini. Besides that, the hotel has a typical santorinian architecture and an amazing infinite pool. Nico the owner and his family are so welcoming that you will feel like part of their family too. Best traditional breakfasts ever. Thanks for such an amazing holiday!",0
"My husband and I stayed at Filotera Suites back in July as part of our honeymoon trip to Greece. The owner and his son and daughter run the hotel and are the most wonderful hosts you could possible ask for. So polite, charming and go above and beyond to do anything for you like dropping you at dinner in their car and offering to come and pick you up after. By the end of the trip they become your friends. The food was fantastic- we were served breakfast on our terrace each morning and had the most wonderful food. The rooms were perfect- clean airy authentic. We were given a bottle of wine on arrival by the owner who has his own Santorini Winery- a lovely touch! Loved the private plunge pool on each of the terraces overlooking the sea. Honestly this hotel is perfection!!!!! not a single bad word to say about it. The best experience and the most charming hosts!!!! DEFINTELY will be back!",0
This is the paradise! This hotel is the perfection! We stayed with my family in the Visanto Room with private pool. The room is huge and very nice. The view is awesome!! The staff is extremely polite and they make feel you excellent. I wish all the hotel had this service! Breakfast is unique!!! I will come back again!!,0
We reserved this hotel wroth the expectation that we would want a nice place to unwind after a long day traveling through out santorini but the hotel was so nice we couldn't bring ourselves to leave the property.   Room Tip: We selected the base room and had an amazing view. Some views are marginally better than others. All... See more room tips,0
"Nikos, Margarita and Adonis go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable every moment of your stay. The location is perfect. The suites are comfortable and the views are spectacular. The morning breakfast is such a treat. Everything was delicious. They arranged dinner reservations and day trips for us and picked us up from Amoudi Bay so we didn't have to walk back up the hills. I can't think of anything else we could have needed or wanted at Filotera. We will be back! Wonderful people and a wonderful stay!",0
Our room was beautiful and spacious. Just perfect for us and our two little babies. Magical view. Extremely quite and very clean. Extremely nice personal especially to our babies. Private atmosphere. Optimal location in the center of Oia with access to the main street. Just perfect!,0
"This is a family owned and operated hotel of just 8 rooms. You can tell they take pride in ensuring their guests have an exceptional stay from the moment you arrive. We were greeted with a friendly smile from Adonis, one of the sons. From there we were simply spoiled for the length of our very short stay. We had the Kanava room which is two bedrooms with a ""private"" outdoor jacuzzi. Let's face it, not much in Santorini is truly private.the rooms was amazing and the bed was the most comfortable of any hotel we stayed at in Greece. Highly recommend!",0
"That feeling from the very warm welcome and first glance at the outstanding view....it never left us during our stay.The room, the service, the breakfasts, the special touches (including arranging surprise birthday cakes)....and of course the breath-taking location.... all amazing!Our neighbours were honeymooners, and it was very romantic setting for sure, but we were three hard working adults, who've had the craziest busy year, taking time out to celebrate two Birthdays, in need of relaxation and wind down for a few days, and it fitted us just perfectlyCannot wait to return   Room Tip: For three adults we took a two bedroom/two bath grand cave...terrific choice and would work for 4 pe...

"Totally blown away. After spending a week and a half touring Italy, we decided to hop around Greece a little. We spent a week in Greece, my only regret was not spending more time in Santorini. We ended our honeymoon here. The hotel was absolutely amazing. We were greeted and treated like superstars when we got there. The family that owned the hotel were so helpful, even offering to drive us to different parts of the island and pick us up so we didn't have to walk all the way down to Ammoudi Bay for dinner, or to the beaches. Breakfast was served to us on our balcony, and wow was it amazing! Unfortunately we had an early pick up, so the staff made sure we got our breakfast before we hit the road. Totally worth every penny plus some! One day we will be back!   Room Tip: All of the rooms have a wonderful view. You can't go wrong! See more room tips",0
"Wow, wow, wow. This hotel epitomises perfection in service, standards and quality. Firstly it's like being welcomed into a distant relative's home: the gorgeous family that runs the hotel welcomes you with open arms as if you're part of their family (except you don't have to do the dishes or help clean up). And it all comes naturally, it's not put on or part of some customer service course that's been completed.They are there to greet you when you come in and make you feel at home but are not in your face.Second, the quality of the fitout, finishes and toiletries is top-notch--I've never been to another hotel that provides make-up wipes as part of its offerings.Third, the breakfast is to die for: we hang out for it every day. The best sound in Santorini was the tinkling of the crockery & cutlery which signals they're setting up for your personalised breakfast buffet served at your front porch.Now the problem for us is that every hotel we went to after this on our trip did not even come close! If it's a special experience you're after in a truly magical place Filotera Suites is it.Filotera Suites, we can't wait to come back next year. Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou.   Room Tip: With only eight rooms so choose the room that suits your budget and needs. Highly recommend the pool... See more room tips",0
"This hotel is run by a family who takes care of you from the moment you get there until the day you leave. The breakfast choices are amazing!!! The staff is so attentive, always have a smile on their face and get to know you by name. We were there on our honeymoon and they made sure we had everything we needed. From beautiful flowers in our room, to a bottle of champagne to celebrate. The pool is great, with an amazing view. We can't wait to be back at this property.   Room Tip: all the rooms are amazing you can't go wrong See more room tips",0
"My wife and I spent 2 nights here on our honeymoon and we wish we could have stayed more. From the minute we checked in we felt like VIPs. 1. The location is fantastic. The views are gorgeous and although very private you are just steps from shopping and dining. Don't forget to check out the local joints on the main road. You will get some of the best food there.2. The breakfast is not to be missed, just take my word for it. And it's delivered to your balcony each morning at the time of your choosing.3. The hotel staff is unbelievably kind and generous. One example is the night we walked down the path on the side of the cliff to the pier to have dinner and Adonis not only offered, but insisted on picking us up after dinner to bring us back to the hotel because the we wouldn't have enjoyed the walk back up.4. The glass of wine and chocolates upon arrival were another ""little thing"" that made all the difference in the world (not to mention the gift bottle of wine in the room).When we make the trip back to Santorini this is where we will be staying.",0
"It's hard to find a bad view in Santorini but the aspect from this hotel is among the better views on the island. The included breakfast served to your room is a world class experience. Great tasting authentic Greek foods served to you right outside your villa door with a view that will forever redefine what you consider to be a ""good view"". On top of this the staff, who seem to be mostly family were very welcoming and accommodating to us above what we could have hoped for. This was the highlight of our Europe trip!",0
"I have just returned home from 6 nights spent at Filotera Suites. The hotel is family run and it really shines through how much each family member cares about the stay every guest has in Santorini. I have never experienced such welcoming and kind staff than at Filotera suites- they were exceptionally welcoming and went above and beyond any expectation I have ever had.The holiday was absolutely incredible from start to finish. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Margerita, who gave us plenty of suggestions of things to do during our stay in Santorini. The first night Adonis kindly drove us down to Amoudi bay so my partner and I didn't miss the sunset before dinner. The family constantly offered to give us lifts down to Amoudi- and even to our restaurant reservation at Selene in Pyrgos which was a 30min drive away. The breakfast every morning was beautiful, we were always spoilt for choice as there were plenty of options. I always over indulged because it was so delicious- I would definitely recommend ordering the frappe as well! The view from our room was indescribable, having breakfast overlooking the sea was a dream and I am so sad now I'm back in grey London!We stayed in Nichteri and the room suited us perfectly. The staff turn downed the room twice so it was always extremely clean and tidy (even with how messy I am). The rooms are very spacious and always cool, which was perfect for a little siesta midday. Our stay in Santorini was more than perfect, we couldn't have chosen a better hotel and we have already started to discuss when we will be coming back. Without a doubt I would recommend staying at Filotera Suites and I will guarantee you will not be disappointed.   Room Tip: Best views See more room tips",0
"We are celebrating our 20th anniversary by visiting Santorini. I picked Filoterra Suites because of the good reviews on Trip advisor. +A in all categories. We couldn't be happier. We stayed 5 nights in the Afoura room cave suite. Fantastic view of the caldera from our balcony where we had breakfast every morning. The hotel managers and staff are so nice and friendly. We felt like part of their family. Their restaurant suggestions were spot on. Katina, Roka, Metaxi Mas were our favorites. Papous even drove us to Katinas so we didn't have to walk. What service .I loved the time spent at the infinity pool just relaxing and reading my book. Had lunch one day at the pool. The Santorini salad was the best I have ever eaten. My wife had a massage in the room that she loved. When we come back to Santorini we will definitely stay here again",1
"We stayed in Filotera Suites for a full week and it was awesome! We were on HoneyMoon and we loved the location, service, drinks, food and finish to the recently refurbished Filotera Suites.The team are amazing and the place is paradise.",0
"We visited for a week and loved the place. It was more like being guests in a private house than an hotel. Although we stayed in one of the smaller rooms, having a balcony & the swimming pool right outside made the experience very special.Not for anyone who struggles with steps, Filotera is an oasis of peace away from the tourists above. And the views....",0
"We just stayed at Filotera Suites and had an amazing time! The hotel is beautiful and clean, the views are spectacular and the food is delicious. We have never stayed in a cave before...who knew it could be so plush?!?! Quite a wonderful experience! Adonis and his family are truly hospitable and work hard to make everything perfect....they do a great job and we so appreciate their efforts.",0
"Fabulous cave hotel in Oia with excellent service from the operators. We stayed at the Afoura suite which was beautifully decorated and spacious. The place was sparkling clean with everything you need available (except for toothbrushes). The view from the suite was simply awesome overlooking the Caldera. Must get a suite with an outdoor jacuzzi if you are those who enjoy life. The experience through having a glass of wine while enjoying the outdoor jacuzzi was just amazing. You can do it during both day and night. The swimming pool & sunbathing area is another good place to relax. Breakfast at the balcony was another great treat. There are four different choices to choose from and not once could me or my girlfriend finish the serving. You could simply rely on the operators to arrange everything for you. Hotel transfer, boat tour, car rental, the lot. The Staff were always friendly and helpful. They really did a good job in giving you a pleasurable and memorable stay. We spent five nights there and didn't want to leave.",0
"For a romantic trip to Santorini, Filotera is perfect! This family owned and run hotel is nothing short of incredible... The cave houses, the service, the breakfast on your balcony, the infinity pool and the warm welcome all make up such a memorable stay. The private jacuzzi (more semi private as you are seen by your neighbours and others as they walk past) on the balcony is a must and it is the best way to stop and admire the Caldera. Although you don't see the Oia sunset from the hotel, the view is truly remarkable (but note, unless you are staying in the western side of Oia, you won't see the sunset from your hotel). We will certainly be back!",0
"Nicholas and his wife Maria and their adult children treat you like honored guests. The other staff is constantly carrying luggage up and down the hillside, cleaning and serving meals. I cannot say enough about the great service, in addition to a breathtaking location over the Aegean with a beautiful pool, morning breakfast service on the terrace. i would highly recommend this location if you are visiting Santorini.   Room Tip: All the rooms have a terrace on the hillside, great views. See more room tips",0
This was a nice place. The people were friendly and the view was good. The location was in a good spot starting close to the beginning of the pedestrian walkway. The view of the sea is good. They were not in a position to see the sunset from the balcony. The hotels further down the walkway have sunset views. Be aware that the balconies are not private. All the rooms are entered through the balcony so you have a constant flow of hotel guests and staff walking right right in front of your sea view. The free breakfast was good. They had a good wifi connection. It's family run by nice people. The quality of the rooms and bath are good.,0
"The Enigma property is small and sits high atop the cliffs of Fira on Santorini. The rooms are large and modern, with plenty of space for me, my wife, and our 19 year old daughter. The place was lovely and quiet. We had a small kitchen area, large dining area/living room, with two lofts and a spacious bathroom. We had a hot tub as well as a terrace looking out over the water and the city, and directly to the sunsets, which we shared with another room. Staff was very helpful and we had a great stay.One caveate--this is not a place for weak legs or balky knees. We traveled six floors by stairs up and down, no elevators, every time we left the room. The staff carried the bags, and the ups and downs were worth it to us, but the climbs were not for the faint of heart or limb.",2
"Situated in the heart of Fira, this hotel feels like a gem nestled in the mountain. The views in particular are absolutely stunning and can be enjoyed either from the overhead restaurant or from the private sitting areas in front of each room. The biggest bonus is that breakfast can be delivered to your private balcony at your time of choice.In addition to the perfect stay, this hotel will forever leave a lasting impression on me due to the driver/porter who drove us to the airport. After realizing I forgot a valuable in the safe and calling the hotel to make arrangements to mail it to me, the hotel driver took it upon himself to rush back to the airport to deliver it to me in person. That kind of kindness is a rarity and speaks volumes about the quality staff. The other employee who stood out was Elizabeth at front desk, always with a smile and pleasant demeanour. Overall an unforgettable stay.",1
"The hotel's place is absolutely amazing by itself. Unforgettable views! The vulcano, the blue sea and the white houses ahead of you make the stay pretty unique. The rooms actually are cave houses carved into the cliff, so it's an authentic greek house! Moreover, the breakfast served in your room with a private balcony directly into the aegean sea will make you feel out of this world. The Staff is fantastic, very attentive, taking care of everything you need with much kindness. The manager Chrisoula really deserves a special mention, as she had so much patience and sympathy that is hard to describe. She made the whole flawless plan for us, to spend the days in the island and they were superb. As far as I could see, the best hotel in Santorini and in Greece, for sure!",1
"I don't even know where to start!! This hotel is the best we have ever stayed! Not only are the rooms supertidy, beautifully decorated and spacious, the service is just AMAAAAZING!! All of the staff are sooo helpful and they treated us like family!! Honestly we felt like being home with dear friends! Everybody is showing true interest in how you spent your day and help you plan your whole stay! The girls at the reception have the best recommendations on restaurants, hiking trails, beaches and tours around the island! The breakfast was heavenly, as were the complimentary cocktails from the cafe situated on top of the hotel! Guys we honestly can't thank you enough for everything you have done for us! You are welcome to visit us whenever!!!! See you soon!",1
"We went to look at sitting in another cafe and restaurant but nothing beat the Enigma. Fantastic views with laid back relaxing atmosphere..super food...comfortable surroundings and friendly, nice waitresses . What more does one need? Perfect end to our holiday...oh yes and the best wifi connection in Greece!",1
My wife and I had a wonderful time staying at Enigma for our honeymoon! Chrisoula and the staff there were excellent and gave us such a wonderful room with a great room and privacy (#4). The views from the room were spectacular and the breakfast was delicious too. All of the staff were very professional and courteous and made our trip very enjoyable. We both appreciated Chrisoula giving us tips on what to see on the island and we would love to come back some day. I can't honestly think of anything that would have made our trip better. Keep up the great service!   Room Tip: We stayed in #4 and there was a great view from our room and the spa outside and plenty of privacy. See more room tips,0
"This is THE place to stay in Fira. The views outside the room will amaze you every single time. You have the picture perfect view of the caldera, sunset as well as the distant Oia from all rooms (only 8 of them). Get the jacuzzi room if you can and get the room#4 which offers the most privacy. For most other rooms, people will pass by your room every now and then. We spent most days in room 4 and then spent 1 day in the studio apt room 5. The studio rooms have the same view but are much smaller. The staff really makes it special. Eddie the house keeper always had a smile on his face and is very helpful. Elizabeth on the front desk knows the island in and out and always has a great recommendation for tours, restaurants etc. Chrisoula also on front desk was very prompt in replying to emails when planning the stay. The included breakfast is decent. They give you a form and you fill it out with whatever you want. The location is Central to almost anywhere in Santorini. We will be back.",1
"Excellent hospitality! Clean rooms and very friendly staff! Best for couples, right in the main market of fira, 5mins walk to the bus stop and ask the staff for any kind of help for tour or transportation. Easy access to the fantastic sea view",0
"Everything about this place was wonderful. The staff, the service, the location, the rooms, the view. We first stayed in room 7, it was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kids. We had to move as Delta cancelled our flight and we had to rearrange our hotel schedules. We then went to room 8. That view, that jacuzzi, amazing! My husband left his Beats in the safe and they are shipping them to our hotel in Athens for us. You cannot get that kind of customer service these days. The location in Fira is fantastic, walking distance to all including the bus. All of us were sad to go. Forgot to mention free breakfast! Delivered to your door. You choose what you want.

"A friend and I stayed at Enigma Suites while traveling in Santorini. We stayed in room 1 that has a small balcony but no where to sit outside. Although we were worried about this at first, it was a wonderful room. We were able to sit upstairs in the cafe if we wanted to eat breakfast or have drinks outside on a patio. Chris at the hotel was amazing. She was very helpful emailing before the trip when I had questions and changes in advance. She was also amazing during our stay, giving recommendations of things to do, setting up the sunset cruise for us and even surprising me with a traditional Greek birthday cake while I was there on my birthday. We felt like at home. Breakfast was served every day in our little apartment every morning and was delicious. It was also nice that we had a little kitchen. Overall great experience. If I return to Santorini, this is where I will stay.",2
"This was our second time and the staff, the view and location of enigma are absolutely amazing!!! Eddie and Chris especially made us feel completely at home and we're still there since our last trip 3 years ago. Waking up with the caldera at your feet and then having breakfast on your balcony is such a great start to the day! :)",0
"When the cruise boats arrives the street in Fira can be crowdy at some times and if you seek privacy, luxury and above all peace and tranquility then Enigma Suites is the best choice to stay in Fira. From the moment Chrisoula gives you a warm welcome to the entry of the room, everything feels as home. The design of the rooms are wonderful and minimalistic but also cosy. The service is very high, ask to bring dinner from a nearby restaurant to your room, flowers, wine, cake, extra ice, lemons, consider it done! One advise, book Enigma Suites far ahead!",2
"When you see so many positive reviews of a venue on Trip Advisor you can usually expect a very good experience. Enigma was no exception. Everything was outstanding, including the staff and help provided by Chris and other members of the team. The location is superb, set below the cliff top pedestrian plaza in Fira. We enjoyed a very nice breakfast that was delivered to our small balcony each morning, which commanded the most outstanding views over the caldera. There is also a larger seating area for an opportunity to sit and watch the view and sunset, and a cafe just below the street entrance. We chose a room without a jacuzzi (room 5), and this was a good option as it had a more private balcony. It also had the most amazing subterranean bathroom. Everything about this experience was great. Chris also recommended a sunset cruise on the Thalassa, and this was an outstanding choice (see separate review). There are lots of places to stay in Santorini, but Enigma proved an excellent choice on this occasion - a truly memorable trip and stay at Enigma.",1
"We pick up Enigma hotel It was 1 of the best time for all of our friends,Everything near close, restaurants shops souvenirs night clubs,Great room service amazing breakfast nice view,There is a girl from Poland I think her name is Ania after she do the room service it seems clean inside like Farmacy,Thank you very much Enigma stuffFor making us so much happy,SAM,DAVID,STEVEN.",1
"This must have been by far our best hotel ever!! Our Jacuzzi suite was very spacious and clean and we spent most evenings watching the sunset from our outdoor jacuzzi. We enjoyed the complimentary wine which was offered on arrival. Elisabeth and Chris at the reception desk went out of their way to organize our holiday! They booked for us tours, restaurants, quads, they even arranged a massage in our room. Breakfast was heavenly, especially the yogurt and croissants!!",1
We read all the reviews on this hotel prior to booking and all very positive. They were all right. The location is stunning and the hotel is well appointed with spacious accommodation . All the staff were very helpful. It is a must stay place.,2
"Our second stay at Enigma.....felt like coming home.....a home in paradise. The whole team at Enigma are excellent, their attention to detail is absolute and unobtrusive. The setting and outlook from Enigma is stunning and unrivalled. There is nothing more to add.....apart from WE ARE ALREADY BOOKING TO RETURN THIS YEAR FOR ANOTHER STAY!   Room Tip: The Jacuzzi suites are terrific. See more room tips",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Enigma in June for 3 days and all I have to say in one word: ""HEAVEN"". The hotel is beautiful offering wonderful views of the sunset! Our room was very comfortable and super clean!! We got one with a hot tub to treat ourselves as it was our first time in Santorini!It is located in the center of Fira town so we could walk to all the shops,bars and taverns. All the staff was so nice and friendly and they even helped my boyfriend to organize the wedding proposal!!! Flowers, cuddles and champagne was placed in our room as well as music to be playing after we came back from dinner so I can't thank you all enough. We will be back for sure, keep up the good work!!!",1
Rooms clean and a view to die for overlooking the bay Breakfast included fresh croissants homemade jellies jams and yogurt fresh fruit and breads excellentStaff very attentive and helpfulCrisoula was very helpful and accommodatingRooms a little small but quaint have refrigerator cooktop and safe,1
"We were only here for two nights, but we couldn't have wished for a better stay. The room was lovely--well equipped, spotlessly clean, and the bed was so very comfortable. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived--excellent suggestions for dining and help arranging for picking up ferry tickets and transportation to the port. Thank you so much Elizabeth, Chrisoula, and everyone at Enigma or all of your kind help and warm smiles.",2
"A beautiful hotel in a beautiful place. A top-notch combination!Breakfast leaves something to be desired. It was very nice that you could pick what you wanted the day before, and it was delivered to your room at your desired time. However, the selection was lacking. A hot breakfast option would be great for tourists who will be out all day touring/drinking! The suite: we had a suite with an outdoor hot tub, which was nice to relax in at night. However, another suite had their bathroom next to our hot tub - and if they opened the window, we could hear them and vice versa. Our bed was in a loft - luckily the AC was great, so we were kept cool all night. The stairs were pretty narrow - so after a few drinks, I was worried we were going to trip! The suite was beautifully done, and the staff kept our mini bar full of drinks and water during our stay. The front desk staff provided restaurant recommendations and made reservations for us when needed. They booked an ATV for us, and had it delivered close to the hotel, which was extremely convenient. They also gave us complimentary drinks at the hotel bar on our last night, where we were able to enjoy the sunset!",0
"We had a wonderful celebration at Enigma Suites. The location was in walking distance of great restaurants and shops! It is definitely centrally located. The room had a spectacular view of the volcano, Oia and all sunsets. All the staff was so helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to make your stay perfect.They made planning excursions so easy. The breakfasts were delicious and the drinks and snacks at the cafe at sunset were great. We are definitely returning to Santorini and without a doubt will stay at the Enigma Apartments & Suites!! Highly, Highly recommend it!! R&M",1
"Excellent hotel, very well situated in the center of Thira. Nice and quiet. The hotel is directly on the cliff with a amazing view. The rooms are spacious very clean with excellent view, some with jacuzzi ...a dream... The staff is very helpful and professional. Special thanks to Chris at the reception for everything, always with the smile and very well oriented customers come first. I definitely recommended the Enigma Apartments & Suites.",1
Highly recommend this hotel. We travelled for our honeymoon in July 2015. Location is great - walking distance to restaurants and the best bars. The sunset views are amazing from your room and staff are really nice.,1
"We absolutely loved our stay at the Enigma Suites - it was like a dream! It was so beautiful, the rooms were quirky yet gorgeous, the staff were beyond helpful - they were simply amazing. Would highly recommend!   Room Tip: Request room 1 if you can! See more room tips",1
"We had a wonderful 4 nights at Enigma Apartments & Suites. We stayed in one of the apartments with a private jacuzzi which I highly recommend. We were with 3 kids who loved playing in the ""pool."" The apartment could sleep 6 and easily accommodated our family of 5 (two lofts with double beds and then one of the 2 sofas was made into a bed) plus a large sitting area, dining area, kitchen area - plenty of space! The views were stunning and breathtaking - whether while sitting on terrace eating delicious breakfast overlooking the water or watching the sunset at night, just gorgeous. Chris was so great - helped us plan our trip and reassured me we didn't need to do too much planning beforehand. We rented a car 2 different days through her - the company rep came and met us. So we didn't have to pay for a car the days we didn't need one, and when I got off the plane and saw the line for the rental car companies at the airport I was so glad I was getting picked up by Enigma's driver! Chris also surprised my daughter with a delicious cake to celebrate her 6th birthday, what a nice and generous touch! Really I can't say enough good things about this place. The pictures say it all, but the service was outstanding too. Clean apartment, friendly staff, tasty breakfasts, I highly recommend this place to all! As other reviews stated there are a lot of steps, but it makes for more dramatic views, but not ideal for anyone with mobility issues or young toddlers. It was perfect for us! Thank you Chris and everyone at Enigma!!   Room Tip: Definitely upgrade to room with a jacuzzi if you can! See more room tips",2
"I am currently lucky enough to be staying in this amazing hotel for two weeks. I had done lots of research looking at lots of lovely hotels before booking, as we are on the island for a wedding celebration and wanted to ensure that we had the perfect place to stay.Let me assure you now that this is THE place to stay if you want Fira as your base while on Santorini. It is fabulous! Centrally located for bars, restaurants, shops and all the sights of Fira. Overlooking the caldera you have the most beautiful sunsets every evening.Chrisoula and all the team work tirelessly day and night to make sure that you have everything you need. They can help out with all manner of things like excursion advice, transport around the island, places of interest for you to visit, recommendations for the best places to eat and making the reservations for you if that's what you want. Everyone is so friendly and they really care about their guests.We are in one of the jacuzzi suites and it is totally worth paying that bit extra for if you are into relaxation and chilling.I never usually write my reviews before I get home but today, sitting watching the boats come and go I just wanted to share this paradise on earth with others. If you are thinking about a holiday to Santorini....... Just book it and don't miss out!",2
The hotel is located in the center of Fira with excellent view of the aegean sea.The sunset view from the hotel is awesome.The hotel staff were extremely helpful and kind.The apartments are very well maintained and clean with amazing views.Everything at this property was perfect.,1
Enigma is by far the best hotel in centre of Fira!! the sunset view was amazing!!! great service and perfect apartment!! My husband and i made the best choice with this place!! highly recommended!!!!!,0
"Extremely helpful staff, fluent in English, with genuine kindness (Elisabeth was particularly wonderful). I stayed in room 1, convenient off of the front desk area, still very quiet. Phenomenal views from my room. Excellent, central location in Fira, which is itself centrally located in Santorini. Truly a fantastic hotel.",1
"We stay in Santorini regularly and Enigma is by far the best hotel in centre of Fira with wonderful views of the caldera and staff who are so kind and helpful, he views from the rooms and cafe upstairs are breathtaking and the location in Fira is perfect",2
"I booked five nights (23-27 May) in the Enigma as a surprise for my wife's 30th birthday. It was a great choice! The taxi booked through the Enigma dropped us right by the door and a member of staff from the Enigma was waiting to take our bags. As we followed behind, the amazing view of the caldera came into view and my wife started to become emotional! It was truly a beautiful setting. We went down some steps and found ourselves in the reception where we were met with a hug from Chrisoula (Chris). I had been in contact by email with Chris for some time prior to our arrival, planning the perfect trip for my wife. Chris was a true professional, always recommending fantastic restaurants and must do trips whilst in Santorini. She gave us a map of the area and marked places to go with a brief description of each place. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she made our stay truly memorable! On being taken down to our jacuzzi suite (room 8), we were shown all the amenities and told that a bottle of white wine was complimentary from the Enigma. A wonderful start! The room was big with everything you'd expect from such a hotel (fresh towels daily, dressing gown & slippers, Molton Brown toiletries & a Nespresso coffee machine are worth mentioning). The jewel in the crown though was the jacuzzi. It sat privately on a terrace overlooking the caldera with wonderful views of the sunset. We spent many moments here and watched the sunset on our last night whilst drinking more complimentary drinks (brought to us in the jacuzzi) from the hotel that we were allowed to pick from the menu. The hotel will adjust the jacuzzi temperature if you require, you just need to ask. It's worth mentioning that room 8 is the most private room they have as no one can walk past your jacuzzi due to it being on a private terrace. The room is the bottom most in the hotel so this means more stairs to climb when making your way up to the main street (Gold Street). The main street is known as Gold Street due to its number of jewellers. It has numerous restaurants, bars & cafes and you won't struggle to find somewhere to eat. I recommend the following restaurants for dinner - Naoussa, Argo, Volcano Blue, Assyrtico. All have views of the sunset. When we went it was occasionally windy & cool in the evenings so be prepared and bring an extra layer just in case. Most restaurants have blankets though. For a tasty lunch, Lucky Souvlakis is a must visit. They serve gorgeous fast food (the gyros are fantastic) at a great price. We ate there three times! *I have reviewed these five restaurants separately*Breakfast at the Enigma is included in the price and ordered through an order form the day before. You can choose a time slot and tick what you want. Its delivered promptly to where you want to eat and they even ring you before bringing it to make sure you're ready. It was always fresh and the coffee & eggs hot, such a great way to start the day on the terrace overlooking the caldera. In regards to trips, we went to Oia, the black beach and Akrotiri of Thera (ruins from the gigantic volcano eruption years ago). These were all recommended by Chris and worth doing. One trip I personally recommend is going to the donkey brewery. They produce Red, Yellow, White & Crazy donkey ale and is some of the best ale I've ever tasted! You'll find it for sale in some restaurants and shops and well worth trying if ale is your drink. The tour is free and you only need one hour at the most. It's a very small set up but the passion of the staff is there to see. You can sample all the ales and buy small souvenirs if you like. The five days we spent in sunny Santorini were some of the best we've ever spent on holiday. The weather was hot, the people were friendly and the food was delicious. It truly is a great place to stay and can't recommend the Enigma highly enough. If you're thinking of visiting or just want somewhere guaranteed to be perfect, then the Enigma is the place for you. Just book it!   Room Tip: Room 8 has a jacuzzi and is the most private. See more room tips",7
"1) Property has a good sunset view..2) The property is located in fira which is a good location to stay. Lots of and food options in the vicinity. 3) Balance of luxury shops and small shops 4) centrally located in the island so both Oia and the wineries are not beyond 20 to 30 minutes. 5) jacuzzi temperature controlled overlooking the sea(can see the sunset from here) 6) Very hospitable staff makes your stay better. The only thing about this property is that if you are given a room at a lower level then you will have to climb steep steps to the top which is a little exhaustive. For the young it's not an issue but for people who have knee issue, it will be difficult. The breakfast is served in the room as they don't have a dedicated restaurant. They have a cafe which serves good cocktails..Check out the view from the property.",2
"We have just returned home from spending a few nights at the Enigma Apartments in Santorini and it was very hard to leave! The accommodation is situated in the centre of Fira, on the edge of the cliff with stunning views of the caldera and sunsets each evening. The apartments are reached by steep steps and wouldn't be suitable for anyone with mobility problems. The staff were all really helpful and friendly and we were particularly impressed by the man who carried our heavy suitcases and the breakfast tray up and down for us. The apartment we stayed in had two double beds, wifi, a nice bathroom with shower and a small kitchenette with two ring hob, fridge and sink. It was possible to make a simple meal with the equipment provided. Everything was very clean and tastefully decorated and the beds were comfortable with nice bedding. Breakfast was provided each morning and delivered to our room so we could eat it on our balcony. The breakfast comprised of bread, cakes and croissants, plus your choice of fresh fruit, cheese, eggs, meat, cereals, etc. I cannot eat gluten so they bought me gluten free bread. They also provided complementary bottled water, a bottle of Santorini wine and a cocktail on our last evening which was thoughtful and very much appreciated.",3
"I stayed at Enigma 4 years ago and I already knew back then that I would return! They have refreshed some things in the rooms (new fantastic bathroom, Nespresso machines and Molton Brown amenities in the Jacuzzi Suites are just a few of them)! Chrisoula is still working there along with Elisabeth and both were amazing! It actually felt like we had returned “home”! The breakfast was delicious and Eddie brought it to our private patio each morning always with a warm smile on his face! Mili “saved” us by carrying our heavy luggage to our room and Anna & Besa kept our Suite tip top clean! Thank you all and…. we will be back!",2
"Amazing location, great service, breathtaking views, perfect apartments and studios. Complementary bottle of local wine in studio, fresh flowers, rooms designed in harmony with the island architecture, everything is giving the taste of perfection.Cris was very polite and cooperative. She helped us to plan the perfect stay and not missing anything from the unique Santorini island.",1
"My husband and I travel twice a year for our birthdays. This April was a special trip.... It was the first one with our daughter!!! Our daughter is 5 months old.... While we are seasoned travelers...with our little one...we needed some extra help!!!!From the moment we arrived at Enigma, Chrisoula at the front desk took amazing care of us!!! She let us rest before checking in, our luggage was carried to the room, where there was a high chair and crib set up for our baby. We had luggage issues...(we are not used to traveling with the baby and we just left a bag behind at the airport).. Enigma was on it! On their next run to the airport they picked up the bag and brought it to our room.Every morning they brought a beautiful breakfast to our room, which we ate on our balcony over looking the sea, cliffs, houses and volcano!!! The view is amazing!Chrisoula helped us with directions, car rental, etc. all while entertaining our baby and making her laugh!In the evenings Elisabeth was at the front desk to help us, she was extraordinarily kind, suggesting evening activities for us with the babe.The property itself is immaculate and perfectly located in Fira. We had a studio with a kitchenette and balcony. I could lay on the bed with the baby and see the sea!The temperature in the room was perfect during the day, without air conditioning, even though it was hot outside!We spent more time than usual in the hotel, and it we didn't feel like there was anywhere else we needed to be.I honestly can not say enough nice things about this hotel and its wonderful staff. We will definitely come back!!!",1
"My wife and me stayed in hotels in Rome, Venice and Athens besides visiting Santorini and even though they came highly recommended by trip advisor and were great, Enigma was FANTASTIC! I made the best choice with this lovely place.Right from pickup to the location, the view, breakfast, the staff, decor, the service and complementary wine and I could go on. This place was so we'll run.Chris was kind enough to upgrade us to the jacuzzi room for two days during our four day stay and we loved the accommodation. Our apartment the next two days was an equal delight! Chris made recommendations for the cruise and even helped us with everything we needed to in Santorini. You cannot go wrong with Enigma Apartment and Suites. They will cover you for everything. Very highly recommended!Only one suggestion I'd make is that my wife missed a full length mirror. Didn't bother me but important for the ladies I guess",0
"My partner and I stayed at Enigma for three nights, and it is an incredible hotel!! April is a wonderful time of year to visit Santorini - the weather is gorgeous but not sweltering, and it's still low season so there aren't too many tourists. Because it was a quiet time of year, Enigma upgraded us to a much more expensive jacuzzi suite. It was incredible! Two floors with a small kitchen and eating area, a bathroom, and a living room on the main floor, and two staircases up to separate loft bedrooms on the second floor. Off one of the lofts was a balcony with the most incredible view of Santorini, and on the balcony was a jacuzzi overlooking the Aegean Sea!! As if that wasn't enough, they delivered the perfect breakfast to our balcony every morning at a time of our choice. You could choose what you wanted to eat from: Greek yogurt, hard-boiled egg, fresh fruit, cereal, freshly squeezed orange juice, cheese, salami, veggies (you could order any or all of it - it was included in our stay). It was super fresh and delicious, and the most incredible way to start our morning. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. There are lots of stairs to get down to the rooms (and back up to the main street in Santorini), which is the case at most of the hotels in Santorini. They carry your bags down and back up for you on arrival and departure. Our departure wasn't until 8:55pm, and because it was a quiet time of year, the hotel was kind enough to let us keep our room free of charge until we left on the last day. We didn't even ask - they offered it to us. They also helped us with daily plans, called one of our tour operators for us to arrange our transfers, and generally tried to be as helpful as possible. The hotel has free wifi, is very centrally located right in the middle of everything, and is incredible for a romantic getaway. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough! Also, we stayed for three days and wished we had another week. The views are so spectacular that you'll never want to leave! Enjoy!   Room Tip: The balcony with jacuzzi is worth it! See more room tips",2
"We had read the excellent reviews about Enigma and decided to book our honeymoon stay with them - which was an excellent decision.The transfer from the airport they organised was seamless, and from the word go Chrisoula on reception was exceptionally good with recommendations for hotels and other activities - we took in a Caldera yachting trip (including a swim in the hot springs by the volcano!) a superb wine tasting tour and also a guided tour of the 4000-year old ruins at Akrotiri. Chrisoula helped with contacting the various companies and making sure everything went smoothly. Breakfast was always delicious, made to order and delivered to our suite each morning at a time of our choosing by Eddie, who always had a smile on his face.Our suite (no 8) was perfect, very nicely decorated with plenty of space on two levels, and an outdoor terrace with Jacuzzi and an incredible view of the Caldera which we spent a long time gazing at during our five night stay.We will definitely return!!",1
"I made arrangements to be picked up by Enigma from the airport. No issues at all! They were there waiting for us and took our bags to a waiting van. After a short drive, we arrived at the Suites. Chrissoula (Chris) greeted us warmly. Our bags were taken to our apartment as we checked in. Chris explained everything we needed to know to make our stay pleasant. We decided on the items to have for breakfast in the morning and were given our key. Chris also provided us with a suggestion for dinner and directions to a local restaurant.The apartments are built on a hill overlooking the Caldera as are many of the hotels and buildings in Santorini. It is truly an engineering marvel. After descending several stories, we arrived at our apartment. It was wonderful and perfect. The apartment was clean, ridiculously clean! It was spacious and easily accommodated our family of three. The bathroom was large with a huge shower. The beds were nice and firm. We were very happy with the accommodations and slept wonderfully!! The next morning we awoke to the call to deliver breakfast. It was a nice spread with fresh fruit, croissants, boiled eggs, etc.. This is the moment it hit us, what am I talking about?......The Unreal View!!! The view was breathtaking!!! It was literally outside the door and awesome. The sea, the other buildings, the other islands, everything was picturesque. Words are inadequate to describe what we saw, you truly need to experience it!! We climbed the stairs to the office which doubles as your morning workout! Depending on which apartment you stay in, you will get exercise on a daily basis! Once again, Chris was there to greet us and help get our day started by telling us where everything is. The Enigma is centrally located and within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants within Fira. Chris and the rest of the staff are amazing and cater to your every need. All you need to do is ask and they will try to accommodate you. I look forward to returning in 2018 or sooner!!!   Room Tip: If you get the opportunity, definitely stay here! You will not be disappointed! See more room tips",2
"We celebrated our anniversary here, and absolutely loved the experience. I'm sure there are many wonderful caldera-view places to stay on Santorini, but the staff, and especially the concierge, Chris, puts the Enigma at the top of the list. Chris served our every need, both efficiently and always with a smile - she arranged dinners at local restaurants, boat tours, airport transfers, taxis, car rentals - everything. And her recommendations and all the arrangements she made for us were flawless. In fact,the entire staff was excellent, as was the complementary wine and breakfasts. Couldn't have been better.",1
"Amazing!The staffs are too friendly, nice, and helpful. The location is perfect! ( sunset view in front of you). Near the bus station, cable car, old port, foods, and all kinds of shops. The kitchenettes are complete. Breakfast really really amazing. Everything is fresh. You can choose your own time to have it and they will send to your room. They can arranged for transportation from/to anywhere. Their internet is free and too fast. - I would recommend everyone to choose this suites. You won't regret it! P.S. Book early since their rooms are looking limited.",0
"We've come to depend on apartment-style hotels when we travel. (It's tough to beat having breathing room and a small kitchen when you're traveling for over a week.) Enigma is exceptional, however. As advertised, our suite had a stunning caldera view from the nicely sized terrace, perfect for watching the sunset with a bottle of wine. The bathroom was also quite nice, with a generously-sized, glass-tiled shower cavern with a rain shower with enough pressure to actually wash one's body. Chrisoula, at the front desk, deserves special mention for attention to requests, for recommendations and suggestions, and for her friendly welcomes, but all of the staff with whom we interacted were both friendly and efficient.",1
"You'll take in the incredible views from the street level location of Enigma before you proceed downstairs to Reception. Here you'll be greeted by the lovely Chrisoulas. Warm, hospitable & informative. The rooms are lovely, with everything you could need. There is a complimentary bottle of wine waiting in the fridge. All the rooms have outdoor seating so you can take in the fabulous view. We will definitely come to Enigma again when we visit Santorini again.",0
"Our tour company (Medhills Tours) booked this amazing hotel for us. And amazing it was! Perched on the Santorini hillside, overlooking the sea and the volcano! Stunning. Our room was large and very well appointed. Nice bathroom and large shower. We had a large and lovely outside seating area as well as a hot tub overlooking the sea. The porter met our bus and carried all our bags down to our suite. (Which was much appreciated after hiking those stairs ourselves!) Chris, the owner/manager (?) met us upon arrival and was so welcoming and friendly. They truly went out of their way to make us comfortable and well cared for the whole visit. They had excellent suggestions for activities as well as dining and shopping. Breakfast was delivered to our suite every morning at the time of our choice and included delicious baked goods, fresh juices and fruits, coffee and more. This was truly the most lovely relaxing and beautiful spot we've stayed at. We would highly recommend Chris and Enigma suites!",1
"After one night at an awful hotel in Fira, my friend and I decided we needed to book at a better hotel. I looked at reviews for this place and liked how it sounded, so my friend and I came over to check it out. We were shown two rooms, and automatically fell in love. This is a place that is maintained with a lot of effort put in to making it attractive, clean, and inviting. I literally have nothing bad to say about this place. Chris at the front desk was kind, helpful, ready to please. If you needed anything, you just ask her. If she's not there, you can call her!! Who makes themselves that available to customers? She is simply above and beyond a caring person who wants her guests to be happy. We were given a free bottle of wine the first night to enjoy while watching the sunset on our comfortable porch! We also were able to book a tour with Chris that ended up being cheaper than what our friend paid for the same tour at one of the tour stores. Our room had the most beautiful and perfect view of the water, islands, and Fira. The pictures I took were stunning (my friends on Facebook we're going crazy over our view). Our room was clean, inviting, smelled fresh, had a little kitchen area with a stove, sink, refrigerator with a mini freezer, plates, cups, utensils, etc... A big shower, unlimited space to keep toiletries, soft, fluffy towels, bathrobes, and slippers. And the bed! Super comfortable with soft sheets. You could choose what you wanted for breakfast from a big list and when to have it delivered to your room. The coffee was excellent, the eggs cooked for how long you chose, fresh fruit, fresh OJ, yogurt with honey, cheese, meets, croissants and rolls...! It was so satisfying. When I come back to Santorini, I plan on staying here again, and I will suggest it to my friends and family. Thank you for helping make our stay in Santorini magical, Chris!",3
"""it was our second visit to enigma and we loved it again. we stayed in the same room and it was renovated and also had a nespresso machine for free espresso! the staff is still the best! chris told us to go to a sunset cruise with Thalassa boat and it was amazing! we will come back :-)",0
"We stayed at Enigma for 4 days on our very first trip to Santorini, actually our first trip to Greece. We booked a studio and it was perfect. The room we were given is actually the room they showcase on their website under Photo Gallery. If you can request this room, do it. They will bring you breakfast at a time you request and leave it on your patio table. Every morning we would put on the white robes they provided and eat a wonderful breakfast while watching the cruise ships sail by. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. Fira town is literally at your door step. All the shopping you can imagine. Ride the donkeys down to the port. Rent a 4-wheeler and drive to the highest point of the mountain where you can visit the Monastery of Prophet Elias. There is an outdoor theatre there too about 15 minutes from the hotel. Take a ride into Oia about 30 minutes away. We only went to 2 beaches, the black beach and the red beach. Red beach is small and crowded but worth a drive there to at least see it. The black beach is larger, has more to offer and the water is calm. I have done my research in terms of location, cost, what you get for your money, etc...and Enigma is it. They have raised their prices since we last visited but they have every reason too, it's a perfect place to stay in Santorini.   Room Tip: Book the Studio Room if only 2 people, it's all you need. See more room tips",3
"We went back again in Sept 2015 and of course wrote this using the free wifi while sitting in awe of our daily view, but haven't had a chance since to post. But if you're reading and thinking about going... book soon! We're so lucky to be back for 8 nights in Santorini in the best part of town. We couldn't stop thinking about our previous experience and so we returned for a babymoon. We enjoyed the fabulous Molton Brown toiletries (shampoo conditioner, body wash, lotion, bar and liquid hand soap), fresh thick embroidered towels and robes. The hot water and water pressure were excellent. The new in-room nespresso machines are awesome for evening coffee and cake (check out the 24 hr bakery svoronos) or gelato. Location is superb, zip straight across gold street to buses, supermarket for water and beer, best gyros shop (good mood food), and the bakery (turn left). Eddie, who brings the delicious breakfast trays, is super to chat with. Anna and Bessa are so diligent and meticulous at cleaning the rooms. Chrisoula and Elizabeth were great at reception with checkin and making reservations or arranging the driver. We enjoyed our private balcony /jacuzzi (room 8) with the breathtaking caldera sea view until noon or 1 pm daily then went on days trips by bus to Kamari beach/ cinema; Metaxy Mas (so good!) for lunch by taxi then Pyrgos; Oia; santos/venetsanos/or boutari winery (perissa bus); or a catamaran (we did captain ted's) sailing trip. The Enigma cafe view is great and you can also get room service. Room configuration with loft beds might be harder for slightly older guests re: uneven steps on stairs and cave ceiling (must duck) but in general, hotels in Fira centre will have these issues. I was ok being 19 weeks pregnant. Our parents stayed at Aigialos which was also lovely - it doesn't have as many steps to contend with and location is still close to the action, but the view is off to the side and doesn't give you the cliffside view of the other hotels the way Enigma does when you look to the side to see all the other buildings. A super experience you won't regret and will think about all the time as one of the most beautiful places on earth. The expense is worth it for that once (or twice!) in a lifetime experience.",4
"Once we got picked up at the airport, we experienced such great hospitality. The staff was so friendly and always so helpful. We were in a suite (without Jacuzzi) in the room next to the office. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. We enjoyed being able to select breakfast items for the following morning and having it delivered. There were so many items to choose from (pastries, hard boiled eggs, fruit etc) and beautifully presented. We usually took out dinner and brought it back to our suite to watch the sunset. We were there in March so it was a little chillier but quiet staying on the Fira side and not the Oia side. The suite was just a few steps away from restaurants and stores. Highly recommend this place! Pricier place but worth it.   Room Tip: Ask for Jacuzzi and balcony See more room tips",2
"We stayed at Enigma Apartments for 4 days and we had a great time! The room was beautiful, the view was breathtaking and our apartment (no.1) was located just next to the reception, so we had Chrisoula and Elisabeth (the girls at the reception) by our side for whatever we may have needed! They were great at recommending places to visit and stuff to do and we were right to follow up every tip of their advice!The breakfast was delicious too, served in our room! The hotel is located right in the centre of the island, very close to the main square and close to shops, restaurants and places to grab a drink! We had a lovely stay and we would definitely go back! We totally recommend it! Thank you Enigma!",3
"From the start, we knew at first glance that this place was amazing and we had to book it. When we arrived, the staff were extremely accomodating and were extremely helpful for all of the questions that we had. We stayed in a jacuzzi suite, perfect for watching the sunset while drinking wine. The views are perfect, and the rooms extremely clean and comfortable. The breakfast is served every morning on your terrace, and is delicious. We would definitely stay here again if we can in the future.   Room Tip: Jacuzzi suite is great for couples! Lots of room for kids too. See more room tips",3
"From the moment we arrived, the staff at Enigma treated us like we were family. Elizabeth and Crisoula went out of their way to accommodate each and every request. Enigma's location is perfect, close to great restaurants and shopping and offers incredible views. We stayed in Suite 8 so we had our own private hot tub overlooking the sea. We were in awe of the breathtaking view each morning and evening. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The breakfast was fantastic-the fresh croissants and yogurt were delicious! Enigma made our trip to Santorini one of the best of our lives. We can't wait to return!   Room Tip: Suite 8 offers a private hot tob See more room tips",3
"For brevity's sake, I'll bullet:1) Location. The hotel is in Fira which is located smack-dab in the middle of Santorini. All the buses run through Fira and you can easily get to Oia or the southern parts of the island with ease. It's located on one of the main promenades on the island so there are plenty of shops that are a stone's throw away. Additionally, it's 10 mins from the airport.2) Beauty. This hotel is unique in that the layout of the rooms aren't your stereotypical SPG or Marriott properties. Our bathroom was located down a flight of stairs from our bedroom which made our experience that much more unique. The views of the caldera rival anywhere on the island and the sunsets from the hotel are spectacular.3) Kindness. This is where Enigma really shined in our book. Our red-eye flight got into JTR around 6 am and they let us check into the room that early free of charge with breakfast! We will give them 20 stars for this as we were willing to pay to check in early. Stay at Enigma. You will not regret it!   Room Tip: We had the studio, I believe and it was marvelous. See more room tips",5
"Dear Enigma staff. Thank you very much for taking good care of my Mum (Therese) and Aunt (Marietta) when they came to visit from Australia. They had a lovely time and wanted me to commend you online on your customer service and personalised care (they're a bit old and don't know how -- haha ;). They loved the room, the view, the food, and the staff. Much appreciated!!",3
"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary in Santorini and we booked this hotel with great expectations. We were pleasantly surprised that this hotel delivered more than our lofty expectations. Elisabeth, the young receptionist, welcomed us with a bright smile and she made us feel that every request we had was possible. The place is breathtaking and the room we stayed at was just perfect (we were at room 8). Upon entering the room, we were already so relaxed. I love the blue tiled floor. The private jacuzzi was absolutely perfect. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom, immaculately clean. the view, now that is out of this world amazing. The fact that we could gawk at the view while dipped in the warm massaging comfort of a huge jacuzzi was heaven on earth. We were staying at room no. 8, this has a private jacuzzi and being in this room means that you have to climb a lot of stairs but I think this room gives you the most privacy even while using the jacuzzi this room is the best I think. Elisabeth even made recommended and made reservations for us at the best restaurants where we enjoyed the food a lot. All the reviews in here are true to form. This is the place you should stay in if you're going to Santorini. We definitely will be back here.   Room Tip: Choose room 8, it gives the best privacy. See more room tips",5
"We stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon, such a beautiful hotel and an amazing spot to watch the sunset on Fira. Room had a lovely bathroom and we also had a private jacuzzi so were very happy hanging out there. The staff were lovely and gave us a complimentary drink on our last night plus free bottle of wine in our fridge. The room itself is very private although the outdoor area is only separated from the next room by a low wall and a few plants so you can hear each other - it didn't bother us though - would definitely come back and stay again!   Room Tip: We stayed in room 3, which was excellent See more room tips",3
"We picked this hotel for a 4 night getaway after a 7 week whirlwind trip around Europe. We were not disappointed - the great reviews are well deserved. The staff were without exception friendly, helpful and made us all feel truly welcome. The rooms on the cliff of the caldera have the most amazing views of not only the ocean but the sunset and we just mellowed out and enjoyed the true magic that is Santorini. The rooms themselves are lovely -we were 3 friends sharing as singles so I ended up sleeping on the lounge and was totally comfortable. The breakfast brought down to our balcony every morning was delicious. The only downside is the knowing how totally unfit I am whenever I attempted to climb the stairs to the street and had to wheeze for 5 minutes at the top. Particularly when I watched staff members running up the 6 flights stairs carrying our (huge) suitcases up over their heads! Go and enjoy!   Room Tip: We shouted ourselves the spa room with views across the caldera and did not regret it for one millis... See more room tips",3
"The amazing sunsets are one of the “must-do’s” of any visit to the Greek Islands. At the Enigma, built as it is into the side of the cliff, you can do this in privacy – with the noise of the hustle and bustle of the bars of Thira town merely acting as background noise. Pretty magical…From street level at the top of the cliff you walk downstairs through a small cafe/bar, then down to reception, before descending further to the rooms, which are at different levels down the side of the cliff face (or, more precisely, the caldera).I think I am right in saying these rooms are caves that used to be dwellings and have been converted into hotel rooms. This makes for unusually laid-out rooms with real individual character.We were in a studio room which was almost as far down as you could walk and, as a result, seemed really private. It was a great size for us; there are bigger rooms/suites but this was ideal for two. There was a small kitchenette area at the back of the room and the bathroom (which was fantastic – really spacious and stylish) was actually down a further set of stairs towards the back of the apartment. Each room has its own patio area with table and chairs – this is where you have breakfast and from where you can marvel at the sunset – and the view in general.Don’t worry about lugging your cases (or breakfast) to your room – the hotel employs a team of youngsters (well, people in their 20s!) to do all that for you. We ordered breakfast the night before and it arrived on a tray at the requested time the next day (usually after a quick phone call to confirm we were ready). The staff are all great. The ladies at reception, particularly Chris, identified some great trips and restaurants for us; and a call-out to the young lady in the bar area – didn’t get her name unfortunately – who was always cheerful and seemed full of life! The Santorini caldera is one of the most beautiful places on Earth – the Enigma is a fine place from which to soak up that beauty.",5
"Enigma is perfectly located with wonderful views. All the staff are friendly and helpful , nothing is too much trouble. We were also recommended some lovely restaurants , one in particular was called Seaside. It is a short taxi ride away but defiantly worth a visit the food was exceptional.It was my birthday and the hotel had arranged a lovely surprise birthday cake which was very thoughtful and made the evening extra special. The Enigma is kept beautifully clean and I would highly recommend.",2
"The best views, rooms and customer service you will find in Santorini! Every great review you have read on Trip advisor and elswhere is true. We Stayed with the Enigma for 5 nights. The views, location and staff are excellent. We were treated so well it is almost still a dream. They are so accommodating and go above and beyond!! Everything you hear about Chris and the Enigma is so true. She set up all of our excursions and everything went so smoothly from pick up from the ferry to drop off at the airport. The wine tasting excursions, car rentals, sunset and volcano tours, she knows everything about the area and how to set things up. Thank you Chris and the staff at the Enigma for making our dream vacation truly a dream come true....you are the best!!!!",3
"I would highly recommend staying at Enigma! My husband and I just spent our honeymoon there and it was wonderful! Every staff member was so nice! Especially Chrisoula, the front desk manager. She is so sweet and very helpful. Enigma is in a great location in Fira too! Within walking distance to the bus stop and taxi service. I can't imagine staying anywhere else because we loved it so much!",3
"Great location. Delicious breakfast (included). Very accommodating staff. They all go out of their way to please. If stairs are a challenge ask for an upper room. Rooms are very clean, a/c, wi-fi, free bottled water and one bottle of wine. Mini bar as well. Restaurant offers great views and good snacks. Bus stop is nearby. Phones in room. Robes and slippers :)   Room Tip: Lots of stairs, ask for an upper room if stairs are a challenge. See more room tips",1
"Decided to revisit Santorini after some years and booked again a room in ""Enigma"" 'cause of the nice experience I had last time. The hotel is modern but also has a cycladic touch that makes it genuine, very clean, with all the comforts one could wish for a relaxing vacation.It's strongest asset besides the rooms - being able to wake up and enjoy your breakfast while have a great view on the Caldera.To add to that, the staff is being polite, helpful and always ""wearing"" a smile.The location is a big plus too, since one can reach stores, restaurants, the bus station, banks ec by foot.Enigma has been and will be my recommendation for a laid-back, relaxing vacation on Thira.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Enigma for 5 nights and can’t stop raving about it. This hotel simply blew us away-- throughout our stay Chrisoula and staff made sure everything was perfect and thanks to them our stay at Enigma was above and beyond what we expected. They thought of everything and it really shows. First of all, the hotel is beautiful and immaculately maintained. Our apartment was extremely spacious, beautifully decorated, sparkly clean, super comfortable, and had all the amenities you can think of. We loved our Cocomat bed and the big spa-like bathroom. We also appreciated the little things like fluffy bath robes and slippers. We had a lovely balcony with a spectacular view of the caldera and the sea where we had our delicious breakfast delivered every morning. The common areas are pristine and we loved the little olive trees by our room door. Enigma’s location is fantastic. It’s right in the middle of all actions and I think the gate to the hotel/bar is one of the most photographed spot in Fira. We walked around everywhere in Fira and it was such a central and convenient location. But once you are inside the hotel, it’s surprisingly quiet and peaceful. Our apartment was in the lower part of the hotel and we didn’t hear any noise at all. Service is perfect as well. Chrisoula responds to email right away so making a reservation was very easy and quick. Airport pick-up was very punctual and we didn’t even have to touch our suitcases. The staff whisked our suitcases away and carried them all the way to our room in no time flat (and carried them out when we left). They have nice big beach towels guests can borrow for beach outings. They also have a bar at the top of the hotel that’s open to non-guests. We went there one night and really enjoyed the chill atmosphere and the views. All in all, our stay at Enigma was the highlight of our trip to Greece. We will definitely stay at Enigma again and couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough. A total winner!",4
This hotel is stunning and its beauty is hard to put into words. The personnel is so very helpful and extremely nice. The via of the sunset over the Caldera is unparalleled and sitting on your balcony instead of at a busy restaurant is a nice change. The location is perfect for a stay in Fira and is easily accessible from the port. I hope to one day return to this little piece of heaven. Thank you for a wonderful stay!,0
Amazing service from the moment the hotel picked us up from the airport until we checked out !! The view was breathtaking. Hotel staff friendly and helpful they gave great recommendations for activities and excursions. The breakfast was delicious still dreaming about the greek yoghurt.,2
"We spent our first Santorini vacation at Enigma and it was by far the best hotel choice we have ever made!Not only is the view magnificent,the rooms stylish and very clean,the jacuzzi a super treat for yourselves,the breakfast delicious,the cocktails at the cafeteria out of this world...BUT:the service at Enigma is simply amazing and very personalized!Nothing seamed too much for any of the staff members,from our porters and the maids to the girls at the reception!Chrisoula and Elisabeth will take care of everything,just let them guide you through your stay,everything they recommended was just perfect!We simply can't recommend Enigma enough!!!Don't think about it anymore-just book it!",3
"Extremely helpful personnel. Great location. Insane views. Highly recommended. one of the best experiences of my life. The rooms with a jacuzzi are a must, its a worthwhile experience. Drinks in the bar are also great.",3
"The room was gorgeous, the jacuzzi on the balcony was amazing, the breakfast was delicious, but what really set it apart was the absolutely breathtaking view out the door of the room and the extremely accommodating staff. Words are useless to describe the scene in front of you as you step out of the hotel room, just know that you'll have a hard time finding more beautiful vistas anywhere on Earth. The staff were virtually prescient. I let them know that I was proposing to my fiancee while we were here, and they accommodated us extremely well and were integral in making the proposal go well. I couldn't have been happier with their efforts. Additionally, they helped us set our tourism itinerary up and made sure we got to see the best of Santorini given the time we had on the island.I can't recommend this hotel enough.",1
"I stayed at the Enigma Apartments & Suites for a total of four days and looking back on my experiences on Santorini, I can easily say that the stay at the beautifully located room I was living in was one of my favorites – if not the best aspect – of my vacation.The hotel is located in the heart of the island, Fira, which I would personally describe as a romantic, small city, whose beautiful paved alleys and Cycladic landscapes don’t lack the nightlife one would expect from the possibly most habited place on the island. However, the loud nightlife and traffic of this alive city were not noticeable in the quiet and relaxing cliff-like area the hotel is located at – the Caldera. Provided with silence and time to really enjoy your holidays in peace, I woke up to the beautiful view of the volcano and experienced terrific, picture-like sunsets that can be compared and ranked with the infamous sunset of places like Ia! Unfortunately I haven’t yet transferred the pictures I took to my laptop, but even if I were able to post them, the majestic seaside with the volcano and small islands is surely something you should experience through your own eyes!The room I was living in can be described as a beautiful mixture of Cycladic and modern design. The interior and exterior immediately made me connect to the island’s traditional art and culture. A big, soft bed that even a tall guy like myself could easily get some good rest in, comfortable couches and a modern kitchen corner with rounded, luxurious glass tables were proving that hygiene, nice design and comfort are one of the most important priorities of the hotel. The bathroom was also very clean, with great variety of soaps, enough towels and an attention-to-detail mosaic shower.Outside my room there was private balcony with seats, a small table and a modern, comfortable umbrella set to lay in. But the highlight of the balcony was definitely the Jacuzzi, in which I could withstand the hotter hours of the day or even enjoy a drink in by night – a feature that surely contributed to this perfect experience.Along with that, one can say that hospitality and a welcoming, kind service are also very important to the hotel’s staff. I started my day with a delicious breakfast, which was served either into my room or on the balcony (I preferred it inside, since my room was always air-conditioned). I could choose from a variety of meals, which were served with bread and different spreads that tested great, but also helped me stand on me feet throughout the day.The staff was very polite and open to any sorts of questions to make sure that I feel at home and have a great stay on the island.The only downside I could find was the Wi-Fi connection, which could become a bit weak at times, but still was fast enough for average consumption on social networks and worked very well on the balcony.All in all Enigma Apartments & Suites was everything I asked for and even surpassed my expectations with its great view and the extremely kind service. It is definitely worth 5 stars and seeing its TripAdvisor recommendations and awards in the reception, I simply had to sign up and share my thoughts!",1
"My husband has been to Enigma 3 times in the last 8 years and I've been with him 2 of those times. When we go to Santorini (and we will be back!) this is the only place we will stay. Chrisoula, Armando, and the entire staff take care of you. Ask them anything and they will be there to help make your stay an unforgettable experience. The rooms are unique, beautiful, romantic and part of the whole experience (my husband has stayed in 3 different rooms and I've stayed in 2 different rooms and we've loved them all). The views from every corner of the property, especially at sunset, cannot be beat. When the other tourists are clamouring for the best spot to take in the sunset, all you have to do is head back to your room and stand on your balcony 'cause BAM there it is! You just can't beat that. When we arrived on our honeymoon in 2011, it was right at sunset. I stood at the top of this daunting stone staircase on the way to our room while the sun set across the caldera and I was literally awestruck. I could not believe where my husband had brought me. I've never seen anything so magical and pictures just do not do it justice. In 2011 we stayed 3 nights, this year we stayed 6. And I still wanted to cry when we were leaving! It truly is the staff's wish to make your stay memorable. Need a great restaurant idea? Just ask and they'll book the reservation. Wine tour? No problem, they book it. ""Pirate ship"" excursion - done. How about being picked up at the airport, having your bags taken from you and you don't touch them again till you're in your room. And the location is also exceptional. Right close to all the shopping, restaurants and nightlife (but far enough away we were never bothered by noise), super close to the bank machine and the bus stop that takes you to all the beaches. Maid service was exceptional. Fluffy wonderful towels. White robes and slippers. Comfy beds. And the breakfast. Look at the pictures. It's delivered to your door too by the way. Let's see, the day starts with opening the window (then pausing to remember where the hell you are because it's that beautiful) staring out at the crisp blue mediterranean sea with cruise ships dotting the coastline, not a cloud in the sky, with a delectable breakfast delivered to your door. Fantastic! Every time we've been here, we feel pampered and like they actually enjoy doing it. Love, love, love Enigma and their staff. Book it!   Room Tip: All rooms are great and come ""built in"" with incredible views. I really don't think yo... See more room tips",3
"In a town of romantic getaways and honeymooning, I arrived to Fira with my teenage sister and we stayed one night in the Enigma suite. Despite the ""couples retreat"" appeal, this hotel is actually very family friendly. We were a little lost finding the location when we realized a magical door lead down the hill to this fantastic place. When we arrived to reception, Chrisoula knew my name before we even said a word (she is on top of everything!) Very helpful and approachable lady, as previously mentioned.The view left us in awe. No photo can even come close to capturing the allure. I could just sit on the terrace and watch the water forever. We caught the world-renowned Santorini sunset right from our balcony with complimentary wine. No crowds and pushy tourists. These moments were simply picture perfect. Even after the sunset, I still looked forward to the night views of the town right beside us, and the indescribable feeling of having breakfast with the morning sun.Some points to consider are yes, the stairs - even in the room there are steep stairs to the washrooms that may be a night-time hazard. The wifi is inaccessible in room but works great just outdoors (only a complaint from aforementioned teen sister). There is no pool which would have been a wonderful addition because it gets very hot in the day time.The gentlemen who bring breakfast and carry luggage over the stairs are so considerate and hardworking. Please make sure to tip them well :)I recommend this place to anyone staying in Santorini, I am even planning a return with a significant other, or sending my parents here to stay as a gift!",2
"My husband and I honeymooned in Santorini and had an incredible stay at the Enigma Suites. We decided to splurge on the jacuzzi suite and I'm so glad we did! We were in room #3 which had a beautiful view of the caldera. Waking up and having breakfast with that view was to die for. Enigma was clearly a prime location because all the other tourists were gathered at the top of our stairway to catch photos of the caldera. I loved having that private view for just my husband and I from our balcony or jacuzzi tub. The hotel staff was very respectful and professional. They got our bags from the taxi and brought them to our room. The rooms were cleaned spectacularly every day, breakfast was brought to our balcony promptly at the arranged time from the day before and they even offered complimentary drinks on our last evening at the hotel as well as a complimentary bottle of Santorini wine upon arrival. During our stay in Santorini, we rented a scooter with help from the concierge and rode all over the island over 3 days: up to Oia to catch the view, down to Perissa to bath on the black sand beaches, and everywhere in between! I highly recommend this way of traveling.. Only 25e a day! Recommendations from our trip: definitely get a scooter to tour the island, the sunset views are great but realize you already have the best view from your private suite, get the jacuzzi room!, do the port stair hike (or ride a donkey up the stairs), bathe on the black sand beaches in Perissa and take pictures in the water with the cliffs in the background, drink your way through the Santorini wineries, visit the #foodbar in the Fira Square for inexpensive Greek eats!Enjoy!",3
"We stayed at this fantastic place to soak in the epic views from Thira/Fira. And Enigma does deliver. The location can't be beat. The facilities are top notch. Most of all, the staff, unfortunately I didn't catch their names, however we the guy that brought the breakfast down 118 steps was very service minded. As were the girl waiting at the bar, and our cleaning lady. You can feel that the friendliness is genuine.Very much appreciated the stay. We'll come back.Please note:To stay on the edge of the caldera does have its natural challenges. Please be advised that from the entrance down to suite 8 are 118 steps... There is a lower exit though that will allow for a round about way up to the top",1
"This is a a very well run property, which should receive 5 stars for its property managers and staff. The hotel is located on a cliff in Fira with lovely views. We are a family and booked a suite to accommodate 4. These rooms are located at the bottom of a very steep staircase so patrons with mobility issues or bad knees should take note. Inside the unit the bedrooms are aloft of another equally steep and narrow wooden staircase. We had no difficulties. We arranged for an airport pickup which was on time and well executed. The hotel is a short ten minute drive away. The hotel has a charming, rustic, 'cave like feel with cool floors and dark interior. It is not a luxury hotel, but clean and adequate for a short stay. Constructive (well meaning) feedback for the property would be as follows: 1-The AC unit in the upper bedroom had a broken panel and the unit itself was old and temperamental. Time for an update. 2- The living room is too dark and should have several more light sources as the lighting is insufficient to read in or enjoy. The bulb on the ceiling is not warm and the hue of the room in the evening becomes sad and even a bit spooky without additional table lamps downstairs. The candles are a nice touch but not sufficient.3- The bathrooms had no Bar soap. There was a hand soap dispenser screwed into the wall but its too far away from the sink and no one wants to wash their face with hand soap, even if it is Molton Brown. 4- The hot water tank is too small. We looked at the unit under the sink and it is too small if four people take a shower and are getting ready. We ran out of hot water in the single shower every night. 5- The breakfast could include a wider variety of fruits and or pastries. 6- The salt shaker does not work as the salt inside has been inside for too long and has acquired too much moisture. 7- The armoire had a moldy smell by the bathroom. 8- The blanket on the beds is thin and flimsy, with a scratchy feeling.9- Wifi poor, but true throughout the island. We had a pleasant though not luxurious stay at the property, I would give it a 3 star rating, comprised of its view, location, and staff. We wish them continued success and know these issues can be readily addressed by their competent team.",3
"OMG, this hotel is awesome! The views were breathtaking, the service impeccable, the breakfasts on the balcony amazing. It's right in the heart of Thira, close to shops and restaurants. Our family of 5 stayed in an Outdoor Jacuzzi Suite for three nights. The view upon arrival was so beautiful we had to pinch ourselves to ensure it was real. We bought some local super-fresh Gyros and brought them back to enjoy on the balcony with the complementary bottle of wine. The view continued uninterrupted in the jacuzzi. It was just dreamy.The staff (Eddie, Elizabeth, Chrisoula) took wonderful care of us the whole time. Even offered us complementary cocktails in the restaurant on our last day. Surprise!A quick note on value: Especially for a family of 5, the value of this hotel is considerable. In many places in Europe we had to get two rooms, and in this case we were quite comfortable in one. And the delicious and expansive included breakfast (delivered to your suite!) would be very expensive at any other place with a view. It doesn't feel like a hotel room either, because half of what you get is outside (patio, jacuzzi). Overall this was one of the best value hotels we experienced even though it is also very high end.Oh yeah, it was also super quiet and great light blocking! Easy to sleep late if that's what you like.",4
"we had really nice and romantic stay at enigma,everything was perfect,outdoor jacuzzi suit was amazing with beautiful view,continental breakfast served in the terrace with the view of sea and caldera and its make our day perfect,the suit was nicely decorated,location was at the fira walking street and lively positive full of tourists,in front of a nice church,room service was firs rate,special thanks to chrisoula for best recommended place to visit,and elizabeth was kind and helpful,you guys are all perfect   Room Tip: outdoor jacuzzi suit was perfect suit number 3 See more room tips",1
"We stayed at a regular suite for a couple of nights and at a jacuzzi suite for another two nights - can't go wrong with either one as you get gorgeous views from both, but the jacuzzi is definitely worth it. The jacuzzi suite is more spacious but the deal breaker is the jacuzzi which makes the stay more romantic. Tried the food and drinks from their restaurant a couple of times and it was delicious. Chrissoula and Eli are very helpful and want to make sure you make the best out of your visit. The location is prime location as its close to the shops and restaurants in Fira, and right on the Caldera. The staff are very professional and attentive. Breakfast was delicious too.",1
"we stayed for 5 days at the astra suites....the views were amazing and the service extraordinary. we have stayed at some fabulous hotels in the past and the service at astra suites was top-notch ...they genuinely did all possible to make sure your stay was memorable. i was unwell and they even arranged for the medicines from the pharmacy.the location is superb, quite and not as busy as oia...but you need a car...if i were to go to santorini again i'd definitely stay at the astra suites...   Room Tip: e.g choose a suite for privacy and great views See more room tips",0
"If you're looking for a place with unbelievable views of the caldera and sunset, along with amazing customer service, this is it! Our room (Junior Suite) was very spacious and the service was phenomenal. Nikos, the poolside bartender, wowed me with his fun drinks and personality. Because Astra is in Imerovigli instead of Oia, it was much less crowded and more peaceful. Our breakfast was delivered to our terrace each morning which meant we didn't have to get ready and walk to a restaurant but could still enjoy the views.",0
"We recently stayed in a Junior Suite at Astra Suites. We are a family of 4 2 adults aand 2 children aged 12 and 7 and the suite accommodated 4 persons comfortably. More than comfortably. It was huge. The master bedroom was upstairs in a loft and had very good privacy. The remainder of the beds were couches that turned i nto very comfortable beds - were at ground level - perfect for the kids. The daily servicing and turn down were meticulous. The room was spotless. We very much liked the location of the room close to reception and pool (minimal steps to road level and no steps to reception and pool) Privacy was not a major consideration for us. If it is a major consideration for you I suggest you get a room on a different level. Astra clearly disclosed to us where the room was so that was all good. The decor was unique and colourful. The furniture comfortable. The breakfast each morning was excellent. The best breakfast we had on our travels. A variety of delicious options which you could pre-order and have served at the time of your choice. We ate at the restaraunt one night and it was delicious. The best part of this hotel was the staff, the pool and the view. The staff were unbelievable. I loved each and every one of them. Their service was impeccable. Their friendliness was wonderful without being intrusive. They were extremely helpful with everything. The infinity pool was divine. Spectacular views of the caldera, pool bar, stunning! The view is the best I've ever seen. We stayed in Fira prior to going to Astra and the view from Astra in Imerovigli was far superior. You can see the entire caldera as you are basically in the middle of the caldera. The sunset was magical and as many have said no need to go to Oia for the sunset with the crowds. We enjoyed it from the pool most days. We were besotted with the view from Astra. We couldn't get enough. I can't imagine a better view. It was breathtaking and this is in large part to Astra's superb location. The location is near some very good restaraunts which Astra recommended and close to bus stop If you want endless choice of dining and shopping Imerovigli is not the place. It is however an oasis in the best part of the caldera for the best views and it is only a short trip to Fira or Oia for extensive dining and shopping. We enjoyed the calm and quiet of Imerovigli and the luxury and service of Astra after 3 busy days at Fira. We visited many beautiful countries and stayed in some wonderful hotels during our 6 week break but Astra stood out and was all of our favourite including the kids. We will never forget Astra. It was truly special and made magical Santorini even more enjoyable and beautiful. We will return one day. Thank you George and the team for your hospitality. The Spanos family.",0
"I stayed 3 nights at Astra Suites and I was really amazed by the wonderful view, the spacious rooms, the friendly people and the great food at the restaurant on top of the Hotel!I think that Astra Suites really deserve to be one of the best small luxury hotels in the world!",0
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful and lives up to the pictures you see online. Just as important, the staff was amazing. They are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and will help you make sure you have a perfect stay. Do not leave this place without having cocktails by the pool--the bartender is the best.   Room Tip: Many of the rooms are different so check the layout of the hotel online. See more room tips",0
"I really love Santorini. There are so many things i love about it. It's the sunsets, the white and blue colours, the several villages you can visit, the breathtaking view from so many spots, the wine, etc.Nevertheless, never did I have the opportunity to live so many experiences to the full and enjoy my stay in the island, until I visited Astra Suites.As a first point, Astra is rightfully listed amongst the most romantic places to visit. From your first minute in these suites, it's like falling in love again.The rooms are extremely clean and the decoration is one that truly matches to a Greek island in Cyclades. Rooms are spacious and privacy is well respected.Breakfast is magnificent and tailored to your own taste and preferences.The pool area is so romantic and from whichever seabed you select, the view cannot be described with words. Right next to the pool there is a bar, where Nikos shall assist you in every possible way to relax and he will prepare some special cocktails. All personnel (there is a big team) are more than just polite and with a continuous true smile in their faces. This is very important, cause they can make you feel relaxed and at home at once.Don't forget to book a table at the restaurant placed right next to the rooms, which is an experience on its own.We all have our specific tastes / preferences for what constitutes an amazing summer period. Nevertheless, I honestly think that Astra Suites can offer such an experience that we can carry during a long time.",0
This is an excellent place to stay. The staff were extremely friendly and hospitable. They went out of their way to make sure that we were well looked after. The view is second to none and the food is really nice. I would certainly recommend a visit.,0
"Complimentary breakfast served in front of your porch overlooking gorgeous views of the island. Hotel staff was also informative and helpful. Very clean and quiet location. We rented an ATV which was a 5 minute drive into Fira. Otherwise, walk was 20 minutes away. Would definitely recommend this place, especially for the breathtaking views.",0
"This is probably the best hotel in Santorini, and the only reason I'm saying probably because I haven't visited every single one of them but it would be very hard to beat Astra suites, with it's amazing suites, breath taking views and great staff (shout out to George the manager). The moment we stepped into the hotel we were welcomed like celebrities, shown around the property and then into our amazing suite. We were so transfixed by the hotel and the view that we did not vwnture out of the hotel for the duration of our stay.   Room Tip: The upscale senior suites offer a better view and privacy See more room tips",0
"I have never had a better experience with any company/resort in my life. The people were friendly and went over the top to make sure we had an amazing experience. We spoke about it on the way home and our next trip back, we would not consider staying anywhere else in Santorini. Breakfast was served at a specific time of our choosing every morning with an amazing view of the caldera. Oia can get extremely busy at night to view the sunset so our location and room was ideal for a quite romantic view of the entire island and sunset. The staff recommended the wine tour and Santorini sunset boat tour and took care of booking/travel arrangements for both. It is a mile walk to Fira which has amazing shops/food. We are foodies and went to eat at the top rated restaurants (based on tripadvisor and locals) and the dinner we had at the Astra hotel was by far one of the best (make sure you order the Moussaka). We missed both of our shuttles for our tours and a member of the staff personally drove us to were we needed to be. Thank you for the amazing experience and we will be back!!   Room Tip: If you are on a honeymoon I highly recommend the honeymoon suite. See more room tips",0
My husband and I stayed at Astra Suites to end our honeymoon in Europe. The hotel was absolutely perfect. The staff were all so kind and helped us plan what we wanted to do and where we wanted to eat dinner each night. The view of the sunset from either your balcony or from the pool area was really outstanding. The entire pool and bar area was also amazing to relax around during the day. This was by far the best hotel experience I have ever had!,0
"The views, the location, the rooms, and most of all the people. The reputation that this place has earned is SO deserved. We could not have been happier with our choice of stay.First, the people are so outstanding. From the personalized check-in, room service and housekeeping. It is a top-flight operation. Panos, Sylvie, Nikos... everyone who has been to the pool knows that Nikos is a treasure. You have to go for a drink. The service was simply perfect.The location is probably the best on the island. Privacy is a premium on the island because the pathways wind through the hotels and rooms. The rooms at Astra are fairly protected the pathways. Imerovigli is also much more peaceful than Oia and Fira. The location also provides a central view out with both tips of the island in sight. It also has a perfect view of the sunset, which you won't get at most Oia hotels. The food was great. We ate at the restaurant the first night and ordered room service a few times. Carbonara, burger, veal, pork, apple pie... all delicious. We will definitely stay here again.   Room Tip: 104 was a great Junior Suite right by the pool and bar See more room tips",0
"Santorini! Unique place and a destination dream for many!But where to stay?Everybody claim the ""best""Best rooms, best service, best breakfast and the list goes on. So where Astra suites fit?For those who crave pleasure and pampering, for those who traveled a lot around the world ,this is the place to stay. I will not start talking for all the small details but only for one. ""Torture"" the hotel staff about everything and you will be come up with a wide Greek smile!They are here to make your stay unforgettable and that's all I want!",0
"We stayed in Astra Suites for 4 nights during our honeymoon and couldn't be happier. We were treated like a king/queen. We had wine and fruit awaiting us when we arrived. The service was amazing. The restaurant here was excellent (my favorite fish dish in Greece). The pool and pool bar were absolutely lovely. The view and the sunset here are beyond belief. Our suite had so much privacy, we were stunned. Considering how Santorini is built, with hotels and rooms almost feeling on top of one another, we felt very secluded. It was absolutely perfect. We LOVED our breakfast every morning. It was the best we had in all of the islands we went to in Greece. Half a dozen types of egg dishes plus yogurt, fruit, pastry, coffee, fresh juice etc. delivered when we selected. We rarely ate lunch we had such good breakfasts! We were SO HAPPY we stayed in Imervigli and not Oia or Fira, which were both more crowded. Imervigli was the perfect balance of walkability (the walk to Fira is lovely and full of cafes, restaurants, and shops) and it has the best sunset view. Better, in our opinion than Oia, even before you consider the overcrowding with tourists at Oia. The staff there were just so incredibly helpful and nice. We can't wait to go back someday!!",2
"Astra Suites really does live up to all the reviews and certificates! The location is perfect for enjoying views of the Caldera and the staff were all amazing. We pinched pennies for the remainder of the trip in order to splurge on a room here, and it was worth it! I would go back in a heartbeat. We had our son with us this trip, and upgraded to a small suite with a separate bedroom. The staff made up a cute bed on the couch each evening and folded it up every morning, to keep the small room tidy. The room had a private balcony over the pool, with spectacular views. Breakfast was quite good, and delivered to the balcony each morning upon request (I also enjoyed sunset wine here)The negative edge pool makes for the coolest photos/views! You are a Baller when you have a cocktail in hand, in a pool, on top of a mountain, overlooking the ocean. Lunch and cocktails by the pool are an amazing value and really good too. Dinner is a much more formal affair, and pricey. My lamb chops were perfectly seasoned and grilled. Unfortunately the trophy husband didn't like the sides, and the chef wouldn't substitute something with cheese with the fish, so that didn't go over very well. Also got something of an eye roll when we ordered fries and an extra plate for our son (in our defense, the fries that came with lunch at the pool were killer)Otherwise, the hotel staff was amazing. Make sure you make specific arrangements for your arrival, as its hard to find from the top. The porters did a great job of finding us, hauling our bags up and down to our rooms. We rented a car, and there is some public parking at the top, but expect to get creative and spend some time looking for a spot. We liked going to Oji in the morning and getting back late afternoon to find parking, then enjoy the sunset from the hotel. The staff helped out with good dinner recommendations within walking distance.",0
"I love this hotel! I recently stayed with my adult family! The view was serene and breathtaking! The rooms are clean bright and comfortable with a balcony where breakfast was served every morning at the time we requested. Such a relaxing way to start the day. The pool was beautiful! With plenty of sun beds and a pool bar. Thank you Nikos for our delicious cocktails!! And the staff could not have been nicer! So warm and welcoming! Thank you George, Eleni, Panos and everyone for your hospitality! We will definitely return to Astra Suites! A truly relaxing haven!",1
"I had planned this holiday for well over a year, as I wanted our visit Santorini to be extra special.The first impression of The Astra Suites was WOW, even after all the pictures and research I had done prior to, this does not compare to the feeling you get when you see the views and indeed the suites.We had Pool Suite 306, highly recommended, and for seven nights we enjoyed the ambiance and serenity of the place so much we did not venture out in the evenings.We enjoyed the fabulous food delivered to our suite balcony each night along with quality wine, why would you want to move? and the Caldera sunsets viewed from the Astra, are second to none believe me.The whole first class experience is generated from the moment you meet George Karayiamis, the very much hands on director of the Astra Suites, his attention to detail and customer care is infectious so little wonder his staff follow his fine example.The housekeeping team work so hard, yes they do appear several times a day, but you only have to let reception know and they will come when it suites you, but either way the whole place is spotless and a credit to their hard work.Special praise to George & Aris from room service, who delivered our magnificent breakfast and evening meals each day, with a smile and their local knowledge. Yes ""The Astra Suites"" are on the expensive side, but if you want total relaxation, superb quality and exemplary customer service just book, I guarantee you will not be disappointed",0
We loved staying here while in Santorini. We had breakfast delivered to our room every morning on the balcony with the most breathtaking views of the sea. The bed was comfortable and our room was very nice. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The director even sent us complimentary dessert and champagne one evening which was very nice. I definitely recommend staying here while in Santorini.,0
"Astra Suites was a recommendation from a good friend in Athens supported by TripAdvisor endorsements and it was perfect for us. Central location on the island, breath taking views from the pool and our room, high quality service by everyone, spacious rooms, breakfast on our balcony and daily gorgeous weather made it an outstanding holiday destination. No need too long anywhere else. What differentiates Astra Suites is the personalized attention to detail before and during your stay. Thank you George, Penny, Nikos and many others for making us feel so welcome with your Greek hospitality.",1
"From the moment we arrived, Astra Suites employees treated us with genuine warmth and showed a sincere desire to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The food was excellent, as was the service. The location is perfect and Imerovigli is definitely the best place to stay on the caldera side of the island as Oia and Fira are far more hectic and touristy. The views are stunning and breakfast on our balcony every morning was a treat. The room was very cool and comfortable. Next time we would splurge on a suite with a plunge pool, however, since the pool can be crowded and it gets hot!",0
"Perfect in every way, the service here was sensational. We stayed at 2 hotels in Santorini and Astra suites was so much better in every way. The staff are so good, from the responsive, intelligent and quick email replies when we were making our original booking, to the wonderful arrival service and introduction, the airport transfers, everything ran like a Swiss watch. It has one of the best pools on Santorini and the rooms were very large for Santorini. The location was also great, for sensational views of the caldera and sunset. We are still reflecting on our trip and how wonderful it was. It is a real credit to the owner and management and their hard work and caring really shows. I would stay here again in a heart beat.Other good things- great internet, fast and easy connection in room and at pool- lovely breakfasts, delivered to the room- lovely toiletries- rooms very quiet",1
"Unbelievable vacation! Staff was so friendly, warm and accommodating for the duration of the trip. They helped us booking dinner each night, massages... even helped to arrange a transfer to our next stop. Breakfast is served each morning on the terrace -- the view is AMAZING. The hotel is located in the perfect spot -- close enough to amazing restaurants, but far enough off the beat that it's super relaxing. If you're thinking about going to Santorini.. book this place!",1
"After considerable research into our honeymoon accommodation, my now husband and I decided to splurge on a pool suite at the Astra.The hotel not only met our expectations, it exceeded them. All the staff, from the drivers, porters, reception staff, housekeeping to the room service waiters were friendly and professional. They made our stay even more memorable. It was my husbands birthday the day we arrived, and they organised for us a meal on our own balcony together with a complementary birthday cake. A memorable birthday.The food was second to none. Breakfast was generous and tasty, with the staff attending to our every needs. Dinner at the restaurant was fabulous, even better than some of the better known higher end restaurants that we went to.The location was to die for. Imerovigli is an excellent location with wonderful views and no hustle and bustle of the bigger towns.We are so happy to have stayed at the Astra, and hope to return one day",2
"Astra goes above and beyond to please their guests. By far the most friendly and attentive staff I've ever had at a hotel. The atmosphere is serene, tranquil, and gorgeous. Staying in Imerovigli was an excellent choice and we were able to get to activities and restaurants easily. Your breakfast is served at your room or your balcony so you can eat looking out at the water and the caldera. The sunsets are an event to watch every night and everyone stops to watch the show.   Room Tip: They're all beautiful! See more room tips",1
"great suites, fantastic view, perfect service, beautiful aesthetics, its magical. Kitchen and bar to please every need, a place which could be less expensive so that we could go again and again. you enjoy the experience with all your senses,relaxation and pleasure for body and mind!",1
"Great service from the all the staff, amazing view from our honeymoon suite and a lot of thoughtful attention to detail made us feel very welcome. Like most hotels in Santorini, the balcony in our suite was not as private as we would have like, but the hotel was amazing!",1
"This hotel improves their service, facilities and rooms every year and sometimes I wonder how can they improve this again. But they did it again! Thanks to George the general manager and the wonderful staff; Nikos for the great cocktails, Panayiotis for the service and his beautiful voice, Sylvie and Kostas for their hospitality, Avgerinos for his warmth and smile early in the morning at breakfast. Astra Suites is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and yes we have already booked for our fifth stay!   Room Tip: Choose the Studio Suites when visiting Astra with friends because the rooms are next to each other a... See more room tips",1
"Santorini has been at the top of my bucket list for many years. Of course, I wanted to stay in a hotel with infinity pool and a view of the famous sunset. We travel with our kids (teen & tween) and had a hard time finding a resort that caters to all my wishes and accepts kids. Found Astra Suites but they only accept kids in their family suite. I couldn't get availability last summer so planned early this year and booked family suite. The hotel did not disappoint. The views are wow moments throughout!! Staff is very helpful and catered to all our requests. It is expensive but in my opinion well worth it. I just kept wondering where will people with this view go for vacation because not many places in the world can beat it!Our family suite was very spacious including a huge closet room to put away all suitcases. The suite was right in front of Skaros rock and had the most amazing views of the caldera. The best place to view sunset is from the pool. We had dinner reservations at a caldera view restaurant one night, but cancelled it and viewed it from the pool all three nights we were there. We went to the hotels restaurant one night for dinner (has caldera view also and is very intimate and lovely with excellent service) and had room service one night which was served on our balcony. The sun beds are so comfy and I ended up falling asleep on them two nights while watching the moon, stars and caldera. It's a lovely place to be in the morning also when the island wakes up to another beautiful day. Breakfast is made to order and served on the balcony. The thoughtful staff member (sorry I forgot his name), didn't wake us up in the morning as we fell asleep on the sunbeds one morning (yes it is so peaceful, we ended up napping a lot) and waited to bring the breakfast in. We went on a tour of the island for half a day - visiting Oia, Akrotiri, Firostefani. Another day, we got a taxi and went to Domaine Sigalas winery for wine tasting and went out for dinner to Anogi restaurant that is walkable from the resort. Rest of the time, we just spent time at the property - didn't find a need to move as every beautiful view you imagine was right in front of us. And Nikos, the bartender took good care of us. He not only makes drinks based on what you like but also takes great pictures.However, if someone wants to be in the middle of action and at a walkable distance to a lot of bars and restaurants, this is not the right place. There are some restaurants in walkable distance and no crowds like Oia and Fira which suited us. If it's relaxation, peace & quiet you are after, then you will be happy. We were very sad to leave this place and we hope to return some other time.",4
"I can honestly say this is by far one of the best hotels I have ever been to and I was sad to go. Out of all the villages in Santorini I definitely recommend Imerovigli and next time we come we will be staying at Astra once again. It is walking distance to Fira and also next to the bus stop to Oia. This hotel has an AMAZING view with a pool that looks over the whole Caldera. Breakfasts were served every morning on your own terrace and made for a fabulous picture. The thing that impressed me the most about Astra was the service, from the luggage carriers, to the waiters, to the man at the pool bar to the receptionist everyone was extremely helpful, welcoming and super nice. The man at reception (unfortunately I don't remember his name) recommended all our dinner places - which were all delicious, and booked the best tables at them for us, he also arranged all of our transportation and a sailing trip, it was excellent service. The sweet freddo cappucino and mochaccino were delicious and so was the complementary sweet wine (I am too young to drink it but mum said it was delicious) and cranberry pineapple snacks. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, I cannot wait for our next visit!!Efkharisto",1
"Everything about Astra Suites was exceptional! The staff, the accommodations, the food (loved having breakfast brought to us every morning!), everything... We renewed our wedding vows for our 25th wedding anniversary and George was the BEST with all the planning and implementing of the ceremony. Everyone, especially Penny, made us feel very special! We would go back tomorrow if we could!",0
"Beautiful hotel with great location and stunning views. We enjoyed one of the best sunset views from the hotel room in Santorini. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It's been an amazing experience to stay at Astra Suites, we enjoyed our stay very much.",0
"Best option by far!! Extremely friendly and professional staff / best cocktails / unbeatable food , great location, everything perfect!!An incredible hotel which should be #1 among top hotels in the world!Heaven on earth; rename heaven to Astra!!Thank you very much",0
"I recently stayed at Astra Suites (June 2016) with 9 other family members. We had a wonderful time. The location is the best on the island. You can see Fira and Oia from the hotel. Walking distance to Fira and a short can ride to Oia. Sunsets are great! Every single person we came across at the hotel was helpful and friendly. The bartender at the pool made us this berry vodka drink that was AMAZING! Breakfast on your balcony every morning is such a great way to start your day. My favorite was the Greek yogurt and honey! If you are thinking about staying here, look no further and book!! You will not be disappointed. Thank you Astra Suites for an amazing few nights!",0
"Oh my goodness! What a truly outstanding place. Amazing location, amazing staff, wonderful facilities and the View!!!! Wow, that view! So very relaxing with such gorgeous surroundings. Everything is of superb quality without being pretentious. The breakfast on the terrace was lovely.   Room Tip: The pool view room we had was great. See more room tips",1
"Absolutely beautiful hotel, with one of the top 3 views of santorini. The room was immaculate, and I have never received better service from any business, anywhere in the world. George and his staff will leave you amazed.",0
"among the legendary Caldera top locations on Santorini, Astra enjoys the ideal blend, of views, privacy, proximity, superb design and joyful staff.We enjoyed some excursions - catamaran, Oia which were nice. But coming ""home"" to Astra was always the best part of the day. Honestly, the feeling was ""why leave this place for any more moments than necessary!""the property is so well designed and meticulously maintained. They must touch up the white paint while we sleep! Our room has two small balconies that felt so private and perfectly oriented toward the most beautiful seascape we have ever imagined.The staff feels like they all are ""owners"" and derive satisfaction through facilitating our happiness.I will return !",0
Superb service. Amazing hotel. I stayed with my wife during two days and regretted not having booked four days. Such relaxing time. Don't miss if you visit Santorini. Fast free wifi. Enjoy the romantic atmosphere   Room Tip: Ask for room 105 See more room tips,0
"We just arrived home from our trip to Santorini and can confirm that Astra Suites is worth every penny you spend to stay here. The location is central to the Island. It is quiet and clean. You are close enough to the other towns but far enough from the crowds. The view cannot be beat. The hotel staff is welcoming, extremely helpful and remembers your names! The made-to-order breakfast on your balcony was so convenient (we stayed in a Superior Suite) - especially as we were traveling with our twin 5-year-old sons. The room was like an apartment and we are still amazed at how they keep everything so white! We would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants the perfect memory of Santorini.Island Advice: Rent a SMALL car. Drive to the beaches. Drive to the other towns and start early in the mornings. All the recommendations from the hotel are fantastic. We tried to steer off their beaten path and quickly realized this. Find out what days are 'cruise' days and do not go shopping/eating in Oia or Fira these days as it's calm on other days. Bring good walking shoes. Drink lots of water. And be smart when you're taking pictures. :)   Room Tip: They are ALL good. The pictures on their website are true to reality. See more room tips",1
"We were traveling to Santorini for 4 days after a 10 day Med cruise. We had our 3 children (12-14) and wanted to end our vacation relaxing since the cruise was jam packed with 9 port stops. We chose Astra Suites from the previous reviews and the view of the Caldera. I'm truly convinced the there isn't a better place to stay on the island. The customer service is over the top accommodating. The views are the best on the island, if not the world. We did a 2 tank dive with Volcano Diving Center that Astra Suites arranged. We also rented a car that was arranged by the concierge. The entire trip was effortless.Although this isn't the best place to take 3 kids, we never felt like they weren't welcome. My husband and I are planning out next trip there without kids!   Room Tip: We saw 4 rooms, they were all different yet perfect! See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for 2 nights in June and it was heaven. The views are unreal, the rooms are spacious and cute (ours even had an adorable lofted bedroom), but the best part is the incredible service. The 2 people working the front desk helped us with EVERYTHING. Gave us great recommendations for things to do, helped us book a last-minute sailing excursion, helped us rent an ATV, etc. In addition to that they have people carry your luggage up and down all the stairs, and serve you an amazing breakfast every morning on your patio. I have never been treated so well or enjoyed a stay so much. It's pricey but a wonderful option for a splurge.",0
We arrived in Santorini after 9 days on a sailboat and the Astra Suites proved to be a wonderful place to enjoy for 3 nights before our return flights. We picked this property after extensive research on Trip Advisor and it totally lived up to the glowing reviews it received. The staff were extremely friendly and professional and the facilities were meticulously maintained. Santorini itself is a bucket list destination but Astra Suites adds that extra pizzazz to the experience. All staff were great but we particularly enjoyed Nikkos at the Pool Bar and Costas at the Restaurant (apologies for the spelling). One word of warning is that this is not an easy hotel for those with mobility issues but that is a common issue in Santorini.,0
"We stayed here for 4 nights of our honeymoon and it was our favorite HANDS DOWN of the 3 islands we stayed at.. Beautiful place, staffs are all friendly and helpful.. STUNNING views just to watch from our own balcony!! complimentary breakfast make to order right to our room every morning is a plus! LOVE it!!! Cant wait to go back again...",0
"Once we arrived, we were greeted by fresh sweet lemonade that made the hot walk forgettable.George, who's been there since the beginning asked if he could share a little about the island and his recommendations and was just the most pleasant person.Each morning Thanos would greet us with breakfast and a smile, Nikkos would be so nice to our kids at the pool every day, and everyone was just unbelievable.The rooms were very clean, pool is a little small but we never had any problems getting seats to lie out, and the view from our room and every place on Astra was just gorgeous. We could even see the sunset from our balcony, and you will see tonnes of people going to Oia to see this sunset.Can't wait to go back!",0
"I don't even know where to start... We stayed here for 3 nights of our honeymoon and it was our favorite HANDS DOWN of the 3 islands we stayed at. I don't need to say how amazing Santorini is - but the Astra Suites is really the perfect place to stay, and it's worth every penny.The staff - AMAZING. The reception staff is incredible - they are so helpful in giving you a rundown of the island when you first check in, and then they will help you with anything you need throughout your stay - making dinner reservations, arranging ATV rentals or any other excursion you want to go on (cruises, wine tours, etc), and answering any questions you have about anything. They are so awesome and it really makes the entire stay so much better. The cleaners will also clean your room twice a day when you are out doing things so you never see them, very quick.The location - The hotel is in Imerovigli which is in between the 2 ""big"" towns, Fira and Oia. There is a pedestrian path all along the island which you can walk to either town - Oia will take you 2+ hours but Fira is a scenic 15-20 minute walk. The view from the Astra Suites is amazing - no need to go to Oia for the sunset with a million tourists in your way - just watch it from your front balcony at Astra. There is a lot of going up and down steps - but that will be the case anywhere on this island, it's Santorini.The food - Each day you fill out a form of what you want for breakfast the next day, and they will deliver and set it up on your balcony at whatever tiem you request. As a breakfast lover this was one of my favorite parts of each day. The menu is somewhat limited but to have it delivered to each on your balcony with the amazing view - no complaints from me! The Astra restaurant is also very nice for dinner - our food was excellent and it wasn't overly expensive for a romantic dinner with a great sunset view. The wait staff here was also so fun and nice.Other - The pool area is also beautiful and there is a bar. Wifi works great throughout the whole hotel.We are so spoiled from being treated like royalty at the Astra Suites, and if we ever make it back to Santorini there is no chance we would stay anywhere else.",1
"Astra is incredible. Forget Oia sunsets, watch it here from the comfort of your balcony. We stayed in a honeymoon suite which had an outdoor hot tub. The room was huge, the balcony was huge and incredible. The breakfast was very good, served on time. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The pool bartender (hi Nikko!) made delicious, unique drinks. Provided tour info and restaurant recommendations, both of which we took them up on and were not disappointed. Wish I could go back right now!",0
"Having just got married on Crete, we had a 3 night honeymoon at Astra Suites, choosing a pool suite over the honeymoon suite. The suite (room 305) was exceptional, beautifully decorated, with decent sized private pool which you could access from both the terrace as well as the french windows of the bedroom. The staff and service couldn't have been better. Always helpful and friendly. The weather was not great when we stayed, but it didn't spoil our stay. The bed had been decorated and a bottle of wine supplied on arrival as well as a bottle of bubbly on the second night to sip as the sun went down. It is expensive but it is a stunning setting. Only extra that would be good is a couple of good sized mugs for tea for us Brits! The food was well presented and tasty, but not a huge choice and expensive for Greece, but I guess that is the difference between Santorini and other Greek islands. Would recommend if you want to unwind in a beautiful setting. The suite is particularly private (many hotels along the Caldera have footpaths that go directly past your room) so our suite was a huge bonus. Lots of steps - 100 from our room up to the pathway, but helps work off all that food and drink!   Room Tip: Breakfast made to order and delivered to your terrace at a time to suit you every morning See more room tips",0
My husband and I cannot say enough about the staff of this hotel. They catered to our every need. Any question was answered almost immediately or within minutes. The greetings at the drop off to the front desk staff were appreciated. The employees always had a smile on their face. Breakfast served at the room was a nice touch. The rooms were clean and the sunsets amazing. We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.,0
"Astra Suites is an incredible hotel. My husband and I planned our destination wedding in Santorini. After extensive research, we selected Astra Suites as the hotel for our wedding group (12 people total) and the venue for our reception. Our group had three junior suites, two studios and the family suite. They were all beautiful, unique suites with plenty of space, comfort and modern conveniences. The special touches of the hotel like the welcoming bottle of wine and complimentary water bottles were appreciated by all, and the morning breakfast that you enjoy on your terrace while gazing out at the caldera is incredible. The heated pool is perfect with its view and the pool bartender makes excellent cocktails. Communication with the hotel was smooth and always accommodating of our last-minute requests. We were treated by the staff like family and could not have felt more welcome. As we were celebrating our wedding at the hotel, we received a complimentary upgrade to eliminate our need to switch rooms after the first day, as well as complimentary use of the relaxation area, which we unfortunately didn't have time to enjoy. Regarding our wedding planning, the hotel was organized and executed our vision perfectly. The staff who served our wedding dinner was attentive and professional. Our guests thought the food and wine at our dinner was the best they had in Santorini. After the dinner, they went above and beyond by delivering all of our reception flowers to our guests rooms and coordinating the return of our reception items at our convenience. I highly recommend this hotel as a wedding venue or just a perfect hotel spot. Also suggest using the hotel's airport transfer service as renting a car and driving in Santorini is a bit stressful. Highlights of Santorini include this hotel, its view and pool, nearby Anogi tavern that serves delicious Greek food, and a sailing excursion. We hope to return to Santorini one day and we wouldn't stay anywhere else.",0
"We stayed in room 303 which is a pool suite. It was fairly private compared to the other rooms. It was well appointed, very comfortable bed and sheets, pillows were perfect ( my neck and shoulder pain went away). The service ( housekeeping and waitstaff) were nothing less than 5 star. Our private plunge pool was about 12x15 feet and approx. 5 feet deep. Perfect for an afternoon, early morning or after dinner swim under the Aegean stars. Imerovigli is a little quieter than Oia which with cruise boats and buses is a crush of people, you avoid that just fine here. Also just off the property is a small peninsula trail leading up a little moonlit called Skaros where the ruins of a Venetian castle lay. If you are a good hiker with a little dare for rock climbing (one small area- rest is trail hiking ) you have a nice small 2 hr excursion to get a work out from all the great Greek food and drink you'll be ingesting. George is the head honcho of this resort and he makes sure your time here is well looked after. Like I said, 5 star all the way. Nikon at the pool bar fixes wonderful cocktails(whatever you like).Breakfast is served at you personal patio each morning at your requested time. I recommend the scrambled eggs with tomato and feta blended in. The front deskis very helpful at getting you connected with local restaurant reservations and rental vehicles if desired. Their laundry service is great too. I have only kudos for this place and would hesitate to refer friends and family here. I hated to leave it. Also regarding the plunge pool, the water was about 90 degrees even though not heated. So forget Oia and Fira and make this your base. You won't regret it",1
"My husband and I recently stayed at Astra for four nights as part of our honeymoon. From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty. George and his staff were AMAZING. The minute we arrived we were greeted by George who gave us tons of information about Santorini. You could tell he really loved this island. Everyday breakfast is brought to your room / balcony which was great. Additionally, any questions we had ( and we had a lot) George and his staff answered and made our trip very pleasurable. Watching the sunset from the pool was one of my favorite parts of our entire honeymoon. Nikos the bar tender is AMAZING!!!!. Some of the best drinks I have ever had in my life. We booked this hotel through our travel agent and I am so happy we did. Santorini was our first stop on out honeymoon and I wish we never left. If you are looking for a superb hotel in Santorini with superb service look no further. Thanks again George, Nikos and the rest of the staff for helping us make life long memories. t and We started our trip with a stay at Astra Suites and I can gladly say its definitely amazing!",0
"Astra has a wonderful view of the sunset each night. It's truly a magical experience to watch. This hotel is nice but beware if you have a room with it's own pool, it's 158 stairs just to get to the street level. Yes, we counted as it took 20 minutes and needed a couple of breaks just to get up all of them. Cleanliness was okay, not great. We had ant problems in our kitchenette area every day from the time we arrived. We did tell them and they cleaned them up each time but no one wants to see that every day. We had to throw some food away as well. Also, our personal pool wasn't the best in cleanliness either even though they are supposed to come daily to clean. We only saw them once in 4 days. The breakfast on your balcony is a great treat. The menu is okay but it's so nice having it delivered to you. We did room service at night once and the food was good. We loved the look and spaciousness of our room. Beautiful aqua colors throughout and very roomy. Thankfully there were a couple of channels in English on the t.v. The people at reception and the waiters were great. The men who carry your luggage were amazing!! All very kind people.Location was okay but you had to take a cab to town especially on a hot day. It's probably best to stay in Fira or Oia so that you can walk all over.The only other negative we could say aside from the cleanliness and stairs is the price. We paid a ton for this room and honestly, it was more than we should have paid for it. The place was beautiful but compared to Mykonos, it's definitely second in our books.",0
We started our trip with a stay at Astra Suites and I can gladly say its definetly amazing! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful - especially with car hiring and itinerary suggestions.We booked this hotel based on reviews that claim it has the best views on the island and also for being voted travellers choice and there's defintely no regret at all. Breakfast was superb and served on the balcony to enjoy the stellar views!The only downside though is that I felt like the studio we stayed in could be decorated more nicely and the bathroom had a terrible stench (like sewage). That said though it still didn't ruin our stay and we felt the hotel was good value for money.,0
"Located on the side of cliff facing the beautiful Aegean across from ancient Scaros, Venetian castle and village from 13th century. The hospitality was beyond expectations. The friendly service in our room as well as information desk was exceptional. A daily Santorini newsletter brought with breakfast on our patio was a great way to start our day. With a lovely dining terrace you can watch a memorable sunset. A beautiful pool and bar keeps couples and families busy all day with views overlooking the sea and traveling ships. This is the best hotel to experience Santorini.",1
"We stayed here with our families for our destination wedding and the staff at the Astra truly are stellar. Best hotel service I have ever received! Our room was beautiful and we loved waking up every morning to have our breakfast brought to our balcony. Everyone at Astra is on top of their stuff and so willing to help! Penny, Kostas, Panos, and even the bartender Nikos were just so over the top lovely. We cannot wait to return one day! It's a slice of heaven.   Room Tip: Our family in different rooms all felt it was quiet and spacious. Every room has a view of the calde... See more room tips",0
My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of April in a Superior Suite huge room that had breathtaking views from the patio and outdoor hot tub area. Room was spacious with kitchenette. Bathroom was even bigger with large walk in shower. We used the laundry service and were very satisfied. Staff was very helpful. We enjoyed being brought room service breakfast everyday and eating while overlooking the views from the balcony. We did a wine tour on the first day and loved trying the wines we bought while watching sunsets.Be prepared for lots of steps and walking although the hotel will handle your bags. Hotel is a bit of a maze on the hillside. Wife and I are big hikers and one of our favorite things was the hike along the caldera to Oia. The trail runs right through the hotel.   Room Tip: Get a room with Hot tub or plunge pool. Be prepared for steps. See more room tips,0
"I booked our honeymoon hotel suite at Astra Suites based on a colleague's recommendation. Although pricey, this hotel was worth every penny. The service was to perfection. I want to commend Penny, Panos, Kostas, and George for the spectacular service we received. We ate at the hotel restaurant the first night even though I never do that. Even the hotel restaurant was first class, intimate and not too pricey comparatively speaking to restaurants in Fira. This hotel has it all: location, service, food, and views. Hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm paid by the hotel to write this but the hotel was just that good! It is completely worth spending the extra money to go here if you can. We will definitely be back. Thank you Astra for making our honeymoon even more memorable!!!",0
"We had the most wonderful time at Astra Suites. Our pool suite was incredible. We spent so much time just lounging on our lanai and swimming in the pristine pool. The service was outstanding and unobtrusive. They came early in the morning to clean the pool, we never saw or heard them. The room was extremely comfortable and immaculately clean. We had breakfast every morning staring out onto the most spectacular scenery I think I have ever seen. Would we go back, in a heartbeat.",1
"My husband and I were on our Honeymoon and stayed at Astra for 3 nights. The staff is excellent, extremely attentive and hospitable. The sunsets are absolutely stunning from the hotel room balconies; better than any other place on the island. Even better than a breakfast buffet, the hotel delivers breakfast of your choosing right to your room. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. If we ever go to Santorini again, we would definitely stay at Astra!   Room Tip: Caldera view with sunset views See more room tips",0
"Holy Cow this experience was amazing from the views to the breakfast to the service this Hotel is untouched. We really enjoyed our time here. The hotel feels very apartment style and the rooms are uniquely designed. No two rooms are alike!The staff was super friendly and helpful. They had great suggestions as we spent our trip touring the island, venturing to the different towns, shops and restaurants. Towels were available for the pool and were refreshed after every shower. We basically got our rooms cleaned 2 times daily which was awesome.I liked the idea that we had a full bathroom with vanity, tub and hand held shower head. Our living space included a comfy couch and our porch had a great view from which we took breakfast at.The hotel offers spa services and has an infinity pool with a great bar. I would come back in a heartbeat. Great job Astra!",1
"If we could give this hotel 10 stars, we would certainly rate it that highly. We stayed at Astra for 7 nights in May and had the most incredible experience ever. We booked the honeymoon suite with spa and were very impressed with the size of the room, the view, and the cleanliness of the room and balcony area. The service at the Astra is outstanding from the reception staff, the daily breakfast waiter(Vasilis), the housekeeping staff (cleaned 3 times daily), and the pool bar mixologist (Nikos). Everyone was so helpful, friendly and professional. Every recommendation on the information sheet provided at check in for restaurants and things to do were spot on perfect. We loved this hotel so much that we are booking a stay for our daughter and her new husband for their honeymoon. Astra Suites is incomparable and we will certainly return. FYI you will read that Oia sunsets are incredible but they do not compare to the Astra sunsets. Don't waste your time fighting the crowds in Oia for sunset. Make it back to Astra to enjoy the true beauty of this extraordinary place (with the complimentary bottle of wine provided or the sparkling wine and chocolates on your second night). Many thanks to George and his staff!   Room Tip: The lower rooms are more private See more room tips",1
The place is fabulous and the service is phenomenal! The entire staff anticipates our needs and things we do not even think we need.My husband and I were truly impressed.I sure will recommend Astra Suites to my friends and family.,1
"My husband and I have recently returned from 5 nights here, what an amazing place! We never stopped marvelling at the view. All the staff were friendly and helpful, our suite was kept pristine. Breakfast was served on our private balcony at a time to suit us every morning. Definitely climb Skaros Rock and walk to Oia on the cliff footpath for unforgettable views.",0
"There is no way to describe the beauty of the Astra Suites. Our suite was very spacious, had a private pool, and the most amazing views! The staff is top notch! Everyone went above and beyond to make sure our honeymoon was perfect. They are so accommodating and friendly. We had the best experience here and will definitely be back for another visit (hopefully soon)!",0
"I have given this hotel four stars and not five as it lacks some basics a discerning traveller may be looking for.To be honest we didn't think it was as good as some others on here have said.It is in a difficult to access location as are the other Imerovigli hotels. That's not such a problem as the ever ready porters are always willingly obliging.There is no lobby as such here. Just a small room with a desk and a few chairs as space is at a premium in these places. We were greeted warmly by the proprietor, George, who did a great job explaining what Santorini has to offer. We referred to his information sheet regularly during our visit.The remainder of the staff are professional and helpful. After coming from the fabulous Rocabella in Mykonos I suppose this staff were held to too high a standard. They are good but Rocabellas are sensational.The room was small but serviceable. The bedroom barely had enough room to access either side of the bed and the lounge furniture was uncomfortable. Like many hotels here breakfast was served in your room. It had a good range. Wifi is dodgy....not very quick and can cut in and out. And no matter what they say it doesn't work in their hospitality room.If you are looking for a quiet hotel this isn't your place. It's noisy. In a bid to keep the place spotless cleaners are mopping outside your room from 7.00am. Others are having breakfast and the noise echoes. People can be very loud. All up we enjoyed our stay. We have no complaints really. It's a lovely hotel but a few small issues means that it doesn't get five stars from me.",5
"My husband and young son (just under 2 yrs) spent an amazing 4 nights at Astra Suites. From arrival to departure, Astra's staff members were nothing but wonderful. We booked an express transfer to/from the airport through the hotel, which I highly recommend. It made the transfer process a breeze (the airport on arrival was very busy and it was nice to have transportation waiting instead of searching for a cab). Our room (a superior suite) was spacious and the view from the outdoor terrace was beyond amazing. Words and pictures can't do it justice, you have to go see it for yourself. :) The breakfast delivered to your room each day is delicious and such a nice touch. You get to select from a pretty diverse menu the night before and they always provide a basket of fresh rolls/sweet bread/croissants. Probably the best croissant I've ever had. I'll be craving those for a long time. Overall, Astra surpassed our expectations. We'll definitely be back the next time in Santorini!   Room Tip: All rooms have amazing views! If you want a somewhat more private patio, follow Astra's advice o... See more room tips",0
"The most magical place I have ever stayed. The views are more than amazing. The very friendly and knowledgeable staff is at your beck and call. Rooms are immaculate, cleaned twice a day. Food is scrumptious and waiters always have a smile. Everyone speaks English and could not be nicer. It is belter than any Four Seasons I have stayed at.There are really no words to describe how unreal this place is, I think it may be heaven... Thank you Astra Suites!!!! Saga po Poli :)   Room Tip: infinity pool room is private and spectacular See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for 5 amazing days and nights at the start of our honeymoon in Santorini and we were truly spoilt! The pick up from the airport, the welcome from George, the staff who showed us to our suite (room 308 - highly recommend - totally private!) and everyone else at Astra who we came across were superb. Breakfast was fabulous every morning, served with a smile and friendly conversation. All staff were wonderful. The suite was spotless - excellent facilities. Welcome gifts of champagne and chocolates from George were much appreciated. Would love to return!",0
"We stayed for 3 days at Astra, and it was the best hotel experience imaginable. The staff made the gorgeous accommodations and breathtaking scenery even more enjoyable. The location is quiet but convenient. Breakfast served in our balcony was fantastic, the pool is great. The beds and baths are so comfortable. It sure was hard to leave, we hope to return soon",0
"we really enjoyed our honeymoon after a terrible wedding incident in turkey. the people makes you feel very comfortable, the scenery is fantastic and we will be back in the future to stay little bit more",0
"Top-notch staff. Very resourceful and able to cater to all our needs, if only we realized that earlier we could have saved some time researching ourselves. The view from the room was impeccable and the best way to enjoy the sunset on the island is to be by the pool with some wine.",2
"I have travelled a lot in my life and this hotel is by far and away the best I have ever stayed in. The rooms are stunning. The staff are wonderful. The location is perfect.It is a world-class hotel but delightfully understated and not in any way pretentious.Most people head up to Oia to see the sunset - but it is so utterly swamped with tourists and their selfie-sticks, you don't stand much chance. But Imerovigli is actually on the highest point of the island and you will have the perfect view from your own balcony or at the pool bar where Nikos will look after you very well.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.TOP TIP - try one of Nikos' Bloody Mary cocktails. His special recipe will delight and surprise! :-)   Room Tip: Try and upgrade to one of the suites if you can. See more room tips",2
"The Astra Suite Hotel is a must stay when going to Imerovigli Santorini! The property and the pool suites are more spectacular than advertised. Special acknowledgement to Panos and Kostas for their passion, friendliness, and professionalism. These two people at Astra are great ambassadors for complete satisfaction while staying with them. They and others made every effort to coordinate all of our activities. Billy, in their wonderful restaurant made for a wonderful dining experience. We cannot give a higher rating than PERFECT!John and Diana Murray   Room Tip: The property is situated on a cliff so understanding where your room is located will make for less s...

The view from my suite was amazing !! From my point of view the image of imeroviglis sunset was magical ! Very professional service and clean room ! The daily breakfast was awesome and all my special requests were done with excellent quality ! The manager of Astra Mr Karagiannis is very helpful and polite ! The best choice for a suite coming out of your dreams ! I recommend it without second thoughts ! See you again next year for sure !!,1
"We don't know where to begin! We were so privileged to enjoy two weeks of an incredible view, IMPECCABLE service, the best food and the ultimate privacy in the Honeymoon Jacuzzi Suite! If we could give a 6 star we would. From arrival until departure, we were treated like royalty, making our honeymoon an absolute dream! This hotel is nothing short of perfect!",2
"Best hotel in Santorini. Everything about this place is truly unique and must experience yourself! The staff is superb! Above and beyond service so friendly, welcoming, knowledgable they run this place with passion. The hotel is just amazing it has the best views, the best sunsets, great food, amazing pool & the rooms are so spacious and comfortable. They provide you with your own balcony where they come and bring your breakfast to. It's 10 min. To Fira and 15 min to Oia. They have parking in front of the hotel if you decide to rent a car (40 Euros a day) or an atv. The bartender at the pool is so pretty great as well he makes the most amazing drinks and is a professional at taking photos for you as well he's always smiling always ready to make your stay more enjoyable one drink at a time haha this hotel is above a 5 star hotel! Thank you to all the staff that made our stay truly romantic and magical you guys are the best!!! Everyone must experience this place at least once!",1
"We stayed 3 nights at Astra Suites in the summer of 2015. Our room had stunning views of Santorini and the sunset. The infinity pool overlooks these views and has a lovely bar at the poolside. The bartender is really friendly and came up with some very innovative cocktails. The suites are very spacious and ours was cave like with a large living room, two separate bedrooms and beautiful artwork along the walls. There are some very lovely walks from the hotel to Oia and Fira that are definitely worth a try. Highly recommend the hotel for its impeccable service, stunning views and the infinity pool",0
"My husband and I came here for our honeymoon in mid-August 2015 and stayed at Astra for about 9 days. Our time here was nothing short of absolute luxury. Our suite overlooked the water and had a private dip pool. Compared to other hotels we passed while exploring, we realized Astra Suites provides the most privacy on the island. The staff is attentive, young and full of recommendations. We absolutely plan to visit Santorini again and we will be staying at Astra Suites. Highly recommend!!   Room Tip: The pool suites offer the most privacy See more room tips",0
"Wow, saying Astra Suites is the perfect hotel is an understatement. Our stay was amazing. The view from our room was perfect. The location was at the very top so the sunset was beautiful. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make sure every need was met. The staff met us in the parking area when we arrived to help us with our luggage. We even had a complementary bottle of champagne and wine! The breakfast was wonderful, filled with warm croissants, strong coffee and fresh orange juice. The rooms were nice and spacious. It even had a kitchenette. When we return to Santorini, we will make sure we stay at this hotel.",0
"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights the second weekend of September 2015, at the end of a 2-week trip around Greece (Athens, Naufpio, Olympia, Kefalonia, Ioanina/Zagori and Santorini). The hotel is located in Imerovigli, which many consider the quietest place to stay on the caldera-facing side of the island. The hotel itself straddles the main pedestrian path along the caldera side, with the majority of the hotel below the pedestrian path, facing the caldera and the rocky outcropping on which you can hike.The views from this part of the island are pretty unebeatable, you can see almost the entire caldera, and walking along the main pedestrian path, around every turn, a new view on Thira or Oia or the caldera opens. It's quite breathtaking. We stayed in a superior room, which was very spacios, immaculately clean and modern, with a separate bedroom and a roomy ktichen/dining/living area and a lovely caldera-facing terrace. The superior rooms are just above the main pedestrian path, which provides for great people watching, but also ample privacy (by Santorini standards, see below) because these rooms are elevated from the path. People are not walking in front of your terrace/balcony. The hotel is right next to the Tholos Suites and the Grace Santorini and offers the same views. Given what we saw of Tholos, Tholos is probably less well-kept and professional, and Grace is likely significantly more expensive. The service at the Astra is generous and very competent, and the staff is ready and willing to arrange anything for you (including early-morning airport transfers). The restaurant is also delicious and service kind and friendly. I would highly recommend staying at the Astra Suites for anyone visiting Santorini.The real question, however, is, do you really want to visit Santorini? It's not as slam-dunk of a yes as you might think. On the plus side, it is a unique and shocking place geologically, with magnificent views, incredibly varied beaches and geology and delicious wines and food. It was on my bucket list, and I am glad I went.But, there are a lot of potential minuses. Thira is one of the most touristy places I have ever visited, on par with Kuta beach in Bali and and Patong beach in Phuket. Overrun with cruise ship crowds, tourist buses, scooters, and scams of all kinds, I would stay out of Thira at all costs. Even driving through it was distasteful. Oia on the second Saturday of September was no better, and we never even got to see it, because there was a huge traffic jam and nowhere to park. If you are an off-the-beaten track/quiet solitude sort of traveler, set your expectations low, and go on a weekday and stay in Imerovigli at the Astra Suites.Secondly, be very careful how to pick your hotel. The caldera-facing hotels are clustered on top of each other, with rooms for different hotels interlocked/alternating along the same staircase. It's hard to imagine a 3D map of the cliffside, but it's important. You may get a caldera facing room that also faces directly onto the main pedestrian path (there are no rooms like this at the Astra Suites, mercifully), with people walking directly by your very special moment at all hours of day or night. As the sun started to set on Saturday night, every narcissist with a selfie stick emerged from their caves to watch the sunset from their terrace, and since there are very few walls permitted between balconies/terraces, you were pretty much right next to each other, overhearing each other's conversations, probably in each other's photos. We saw fireworks for numerous weddings taking place that night (and heard the clinking of glasses from a restaurant a few levels up from our terrace). Although I really do think the Astra provides one of the best set-ups, no place is going to give you real privacy. Some of the best rooms at the Grace face directly onto the hiking path down to the outcropping below Imerovigli with people walking by constantly. So make sure to keep your expectations in check and emotions running not too high, or you will set yourself up for disappointment -- the woman on the terrace next to us had an extended conversation about how her mother in law ruined her Santorini wedding (I was not trying to eavsdrop, she was right below me).Finally, sitting on your terrace looking at the caldera is wonderful, but there is more to Santorini, which has many great beaches (Red Beach, White Beach), fantastic wineries and boat tours and archaeological ruins to visit. But on the weekend, all of these places were mobbed. I was glad that we did not spend more than 2.5 days in Santorini (in fact, 1.5 would have been enough), although Sunday evening, as we were packing to leave, the crowds dissipated and it was clear that on the weekdays, the horde-like atmosphere abates and Imerovigli could truly be considered quiet/peaceful. If you can, I would strongly recommend visiting during the week in August/September. All in all, I am glad I went, and I am glad to have had Astra Suites as a relatively quiet and wonderfully-run haven to call home while in Santorini, but Santorini might not be ideal for everyone.",14
Perfection! The hotel is overlooking the water; close enough to the main town and yet far enough away from the action that you feel like you're in another world. Hotel staff were amazing ... extremely friendly and super helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel! Trip of a lifetime!,1
"We stayed in Athina's room in early August. It was faultless. The friendly, helpful and attentive staff made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The views are stunning, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast served on the balcony every morning was lovely, and we won't forget the great views of Oia from the room. From the research we did before booking, it is also good value compared to other nice hotels in Oia, and the location is nice and central - close to tavernas as well as a small super market. We can't recommend Atrina enough!   Room Tip: Treat yourself to a room with an outdoor jacuzzi (we wish we did) See more room tips",0
"Our family including myself, my husband and our teenage children, stayed this past week in both the Cavana Suite and Dimitri's House. We had originally booked the Alexander House for the two adults, but were upgraded to Dimitri's House which had a wonderful jacuzzi for nighttime relaxation under the Aegean stars. We have traveled all over the world, and have never stayed in such a magical place. The rooms were even more elegant than they look in the photos, and the additional touches were the icing on the cake. We were greeted with a bottle of local wine and unlimited water bottles at our disposal. The breakfast on the balcony was divine---greek yogurt with fresh fruit. or eggs made to order all served with fresh pastries baked on site. We had to leave at 5 am to catch our plane and Athena arranged for our breakfast to arrive at 4:30 am so we could enjoy one last meal before our long trip home to the US.My husband and I have vowed to return alone next time when our children are in college. Atrina Traditional Houses is truly a romantic getaway in one of the most beautiful spots in the world!!",0
Stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon and was blown away by the experience. Having breakfast delivered to you on your balcony and the staff was so friendly!!!! LOVED IT and would reccomend to anyone going to Santorini,0
"I stayed in the Dimitris. Fantastic experience, atmosphere, great view, nice and friendly staffs. For sure it is worth staying here. Maybe the only thing is that they don't have variety of breakfast, so if you stay for 3 days or more you might get bored.",0
"Staying at the cliffside was an important part of staying in Oia, Santorini. I can understand the prices in Oia are generally expensive for this type of accommodation, however, Atrina is the most affordable, but does not skimp on the facilities, location and service. The staff were always helpful with suggestions and service was very discrete. Staying in this type of accommodation will always be expensive, but in context, Atrina was good value for money.   Room Tip: The pictures on the website are an accurate guide as to the facilities and rooms See more room tips",0
"Thoroughly enjoyed a 5-night stay at Atrina. The staff is superb and the grounds are beautiful. I can't emphasize enough how on point the staff was in every aspect of caring for the rooms and customer experience. The facilities look brand new but are actually 10+ years old - just perfectly maintained. Once the room was paid for, most other things were included (bottles of water etc) and additional food/beverage/room service was affordable without lots of additional fees like you would experience with corporate chains. The pool area got a little busy and cramped (half families with kids and half couples) but that will be the case in most hotels on Oia unless you have a private pool for your room. Perfect location for exploring Oia. Great experience!   Room Tip: Most rooms have neighbors although still reasonably private. Check out a map with all of your option... See more room tips",0
"First impressions are the lasting ones they say and this is true of our experience from the moment we were greeted at the airport to the arrival at Atrina. We were warmly greeted whilst our baggage was taken down to our rooms. Once the formalities were dealt with we were shown to our accommodation in the most breathtaking position opposite the Caldera.We stayed in the Junior suite, which upon arrival was spotlessly clean with two bedrooms and one shared shower room. The main living space has an area for food prep and is well stocked with crockery, glasses and cutlery. The shower room was perhaps the only slight weakness of our accommodation as it is on the small side for 4 people sharing, however it is a minor thing and didn't detract at all from the overall experience.Breakfast is ordered each morning by a mobile phone provided to guests and is delivered directly your balcony, where a member of staff lays the table with linen and cutlery before setting down the lovely, freshly prepared breakfast. You are truly given a very personal experience and made to feel very special.The rooms are cleaned to a high standard and the lovely women also do a night service where they prepare your room leaving lovely chocolates and fresh towels.The staff we came in contact with all provide an excellent level of service, with plenty of smiles too; they were all excellent.The situation of the rooms lend themselves to magnificent views to the Caldera and the white washed surrounding buildings that tumble down to the sea, it is one of the most beautiful places we have visited and does simply take your breath away. In some ways its a bit of a surreal experience, Paradise has been said before and without wanting to appear too mawkish, it does appear to be the best adjective to use.The pool area is small but never too busy to find a lounger as people don't tend to hang out there all day and also the terrace areas outside the rooms have more seating and sun loungers, some also have hot tubs (ours didn't)Atrina is situated at the beginning of the 'Ohia main strip' which is a very sophisticated area which is pedestrianised, so you can leisurely stroll, taking in the scenery and browsing in the shops. It does have a sophisticated price tag too, but you can find reasonably priced places to eat as there are so many.We hired a car and visited a few other places, mainly Fira &The Red Beach. It would be wise to do this early in the day as the Islands road's do get very congested. We only stayed three nights in Santorini as it was part of a three Island trip, but it is without a doubt the Island that has left the most special impression and we will certainly return and would have no hesitation staying at Atrina. Thank you all for making our stay so wonderful !   Room Tip: All rooms face the Caldera so all have the same spectacular views. cv See more room tips",0
"Location is right at the entrance to Oia which is really nice for exploring the rest of the IslandBeautiful views from the roomsOur room was a big size, really comfortableThere's a pool downstairsStaff is very helpful though can be a bit short",0
"I'd seen the photos online and so had a good idea of what we were going to see, but even so, on arrival, the view at Atrina's literally took my breath away. The setting of Atrina is just magnificent, and is in the best part of Oia. I cannot say enough how happy we were with the location of the hotel. Oia can be busy, particularly in July, but you don't feel any of that since the hotel is just out of the main busy/restaurant area, while being only a few steps away from everything. Our room (Melanie) was just lovely and there are so many thoughtful little touches added. We had the best view, our own little balcony and a divine blue bathroom with a large shower. Having your own fridge and mini kitchen is great for making lunches (there are pots and two stove rings too but we ate dinner out each night). Our towels were changed twice a day (such a luxury) and having our breakfast delivered each morning to our own balcony was just delightful. The room was spacious with a couch and a coffee table plus we had our own little table to eat at indoors if it was midday and a bit hot outside.The pool is lovely, with a great shower (nice touch) and fresh towels always available. You can also have drinks and lunch there (I recommend the club sandwich), with the view always constant.The family is kind, professional and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. All the staff were friendly and kind. We spent 7 nights at the hotel and would love to go back. Atrina really deserves its top place on TripAdvisor!!   Room Tip: Melanie suited us as it was quiet and nobody has to pass the room to get to the pool. See more room tips",0
"From the moment we arrived at Atrina, we felt welcomed and relaxed.The staff were so attentive and friendly. Our room was outstanding with a great view. The bed was so comfortable with beautiful quality linen. The pool area and pool bar was fun- everywhere was very clean. The breakfast was superb. Atrina would be the best place that we have ever stayed in and would have to be one of the best places to stay in Santorini. We would love to return one day.",0
"A stay in beautiful Oia deserves to be the best and Atrina did not disappoint! The property itself is stunning, and well maintained. Our room was an oversized suite, for 3 ppl, and was more than enough space for us. The staff and the level of service was exceptional, their hospitality made us feel as if we were staying in someone's private home. Breakfast is delivered to your personal balcony each morning, and the menu selection is fantastic and fresh. We had 3 nights at Atrina but wishing we had stayed for more! Will definitely re-book Atrina for our next trip to Oia!",0
"Beyond our expectations! Great customer service!!Great location, right next to beginning of the pedestrian path in Oia. The room was fantastic, modern and updated. The small terrace felt very private. Breakfast was delivered every morning to your own terrace; what a perk! Some room terraces such as the ""junior"" or ""studio"" are not as private but these rooms are cheaper. We stayed in Mina's suite. It was a pleasant surprise to find out a small jacuzzi as part of the room terrace. They just built it so its not reflected in the website pictures yet. Highly recommended",0
"We stayed at Atrina for our honeymoon and could not have been happier! The staff are so friendly, accommodating, and helpful. The location is perfect to walk to all restaurants, Ammoudi Bay, and the cliff trail. Athina was so helpful in booking us some dinner reservations as well as a catamaran tour(highly recommend). The pool was perfect with outstanding views of the caldera. We woke up every morning and ate breakfast that was delivered to our balcony and could not get over the absolutely breathtaking views. We stayed in Marina house and loved our balcony, white cave house, and bathroom! If you are thinking about places to stay in Oia, come to Atrina! We could not think of a single thing we did not like about the hotel, it was perfect for our honeymoon! Thank you to all the staff who made it a perfect stay!",0
We had a wonderful stay in Santorini at Atrina Traditional Houses. Irene and her daughters were very wonderful and always went out of there way to make our stay feel as great as possible. The hotel is beautiful and close to all the shops in Oia. I will definitely be back!,0
"My wife and I just returned from Greece, making stops in Athens, Mykonos and Santorini for our honeymoon. Our stay at Atrina was incredibly special. The level of customer service and view from our suite made our stay even more enjoyable than initially anticipated! Athena, Costas and the rest of the staff went above and beyond with recommendations, travel arrangements and reservations, breakfast served on our balcony each morning, etc! Cannot thank everyone enough for making our honeymoon as special as it was and would certainly recommend to anyone visiting! If I had to find something to complain about, and not specific to Atrina necessarily, but water pressure was a little weak ;)",0
"We arrived at Atrina at night, having no idea of the view which awaited us the next morning. Absolutely breathtaking!! Our room, Caverna 1894 was rather special too, a huge cave with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a comfy sofa bed, it was perfect for our family of 5. Athena, Melanie and the staff were fabulous, arranging dinners, boats, rental cars and spoiling us with a huge spread of food in our room on our arrival in case we were hungry after our long flight delay. The hotel's location is perfect, right off of the main path in town, although you would never know it as the hotel is so quiet. The pool is a few steps away from all of the rooms, with a bar and waiter right there. There is a choice of 3 breakfasts which kept everyone in our family happy, all delivered to your private patio. Can't imagine there is anywhere better on the island, we all loved it.   Room Tip: Choose rooms at the outer edge of the property (such as Caverna 1894) if you don't want people w...

"You can tell that it's family owned and operated. The rooms are impeccable, the staff is excellent. We wanted to relax, mission accomplished.... The natural beauty is incredible, in the summer the days are hot but the evenings are cool. Follow their suggestions for dining out an excursions. If we ever return to Santorini and they still own this place this is where will stay... Delighted!!!!",0
This Hotel is complete heaven. We had an amazing time. The rooms are caved on the rock. The view i incredible. The memories i have of the breakfest on the balcony I'll cherish for the rest of my life. We were so well treated as well that we felt like home. Location is absolutely perfect. Nothing nothing could be more perfect :),1
This was our second visit to stunning Santorini and I spent a great deal of time choosing somewhere to stay in Oia that was away from the crowds but close enough to the centre of the village. So pleased we booked Atrina - our tradional cave room was lovely (Dimitris Suite) and we had a large balcony with outdoor hot tub. Location is excellent - just a short walk and you have access to everything Oia has to offer. Staff were all excellent and very friendly - and a big thank you to Athena for recommending and booking a couple of restaurants for us (Red Bicycle for romantic fine dining and Ochre for dinner with super sunset view). Would definitely recommend   Room Tip: Am sure all are fine but a one with an outdoor hot tub is best See more room tips,0
Everything was so fantastic! All staff members were incredibly helpful and welcoming. The views were excellent. It's perfect for couples and honeymooners. Breakfast was delicious. We will definitely be back.,0
"It was everything we wanted and needed. Being on our honeymoon and coming off a big few nights in Mykonos, Atrina Traditional Houses was perfect for our needs. From the stunning views to the beautiful selections of breakfast we where overwhelmed.Terrific tips on where to watch the sunset and eat too which was awesome!Hats off to the beautiful man who carried out bags.",0
"Wow! What an amazing place Santorini is! It is the little island filled with beautiful views and mostly beautiful people. We can honestly say that the service we got from Athena for helping us with any little (or big) thing we may have needed, and for the amazing staff who always had a smile on their faces. It was honestly the little things we will remember most. The breakfast on the balcony every morning with breathtaking views, laying at the pool and without asking, the servers bringing you water, the kindhearted workers, the cleanliness and thoughtfulness of the cleaning ladies, the ease of help from Athena to arrange anything we wanted (from dinner reservations, to wine tours, to sunset catamaran trips, to photoshoots, to simply recommending something for my sunburned shoulders). All we needed to do was ask, and they would go above and beyond for our happiness. We had no idea what day of the week was, what time it was, and that was the beauty of it all. On our departure, we wanted to tip Athena for her help and she said she wouldn't accept it but would give to the other staff members (cleaning, servers, etc). She also arranged for us to have breakfast (even though it was 4:30 in the morning - she didn't want us leaving hungry). She also saw us off at 5:15 am! Nothing but love for this place and for the people. Definitely coming back to stay here again. If you are looking for great food, great service and breathtaking views, stay here!",0
My wife and i have heard about the views in Oia but could not imagine it would be so nice. We were debating between a couple hotels here and the Atrina house had the availability we needed and had some of the best reviews. Little did we know this was no ordinary hotel. When we arrived to the hotel the owner was there waiting to greet us. She was very nice and very helpful with anything we needed. If you wanted to rent a ATV or go on a boat tour they would help you set it up that way you had nothing to worry about. Every morning they setup breakfast for you on your patio area which was very nice. At one point we had some problem with our hot water. We called the front desk and within 5 minutes someone was knocking on our door to fix it. They couldn't fix it right away which was understandable so they let us shower in another room so we wouldn't lose time. Anytime we needed help with bags or recommendations of tours restaurants basically anything they were very helpful. Our outgoing flight was very early in the morning but they still made sure to have breakfast for us before we left and the owner made sure she was there to say goodbye to use before we left. This was one of the nicest and friendliest hotels i have ever stayed in. I would recommend this to any of my friends and family that may be traveling there.,0
"We stayed three nights in Tholos, which was sincerely the prettiest room I/ve ever stayed in. The hotel is located perfectly close to the beginning of the strip, and the staff is so warm and welcoming that it/s hard to believe to be true! We arrived very early in the morning, and were offered a lovely breakfast at the pool, despite technically we were not entitled to it until the next morning. We got our room before the actual check-in time, and it was absolutely gorgeous! The view to Caldera from the balcony of Tholos is absolutely breathtaking. The breakfast was delicious, served to our balcony every morning, the rooms are cleaned to perfection daily and the staff at the hotel are extraordinary! We could not have been happier with our stay, despite the quite high expectations we had after reading the reviews here on Tripadvisor before our vacation. I give my warmest recommendations to Atrina and will definitely be returning! Thank you for making our stay unforgettable!",0
"We researched Oia accom thoroughly and this was one which had the best reviews. Atrina traditional houses did not disappoint! It well and truly exceeded our expectations. The views speak for them self (breathtaking - how cliche!) but the rooms were large and are virtually your own house but with the added bonus of the full hotel service. Breakfast served on your balcony at your desired time, pool was amazing and even though the all the rooms were fully booked, it felt like no one was there. Very relaxing and always space around the pool. The service was amazing, thanks to Athina and her mum for their wonderful service and recommendations. Also the bar tender by the pool thanks to him. Location was brilliant, close to everything, we stayed 6 nights and would love to come back again one day. 5 star experience for us.",0
"Beautiful rooms in a perfect location. We stayed in Athina House which doesn't have a hot tub but it's gorgeous! The views from the hotel balcony and pool are truly breathtaking. The staff were great and couldn't do enough for us. Athina and her mother (the owners) were brilliant and booked us taxis, arranged trips and nothing was too much to ask. They even dried our swim suits on our last day before we packed them in to our cases. Central location in Oia close to lots of restaurants and shops. We will be coming back!",0
"Wow, I stayed 3 nights at Atrina in the very private Xenonas suite and what an experience. First of all, Santorini is a very special wonderful place and Oia is a gem! Away but not too far from the crowds in the main town Fira. Secondly I was pleased to meet Athina and her lovely mother Irene who ensured we were looked after during our stay. Thirdly the hotel staff are very conscientious and hard working which is very much appreciated! I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone! Don't think just book and go!",0
"My husband and I finally arrived at Atrina Traditional Houses at 7 am after a grueling 33 hour trip marred by flight delays, missed connections and lost luggage. Athina graciously greeted us, showed us our to beautiful room and arranged to have breakfast delivered early. That level of service continued throughout our wonderful stay. Nothing we asked was too much for the accommodating staff. They made dinner reservations, arranged transportation and picked up our ferry tickets. They also sent a driver to retrieve our luggage when it finally arrived at the Santorini airport.We stayed in Mina's house which is beautiful and spacious. The huge terrace has a table, lounge chairs and a small hot tub along with an amazing view of the caldera. We also enjoyed cooling off and having a cocktail at the lovely pool.The property does have a lot of steps, so try to pick one of the higher houses if that is an issue.Oia is expensive, but it's stunning location is worth the splurge. We felt that the quality, service and location of Atrina offered good value compared to other options in Oia.   Room Tip: Mina's house is beautiful and spacious with a fantastic terrace. See more room tips",0
"I had very high expectations and this hotel exceeded them in every possible way. The views were unbelievably beautiful, the service was excellent, and the room was super comfortable and unique. I would love to visit Oia again and if I do, I'll definitely try to stay here again.",0
"My wife and I stayed at Atrina on our honeymoon. We stayed in the Dimitris suite and it was the most amazing view of Santorini and Oia. It is very conveniently placed close to the beginning of the Oia strip, and the view from the hotel was second to none. The maid service was excellent and they left chocolate and even put my wife's teddy bear in a different position every morning, which got a good chuckle. The hotel was so flexible and even gave us a cellphone that we could use to call the front desk even when we were out, so that we could put in requests to warm up our hot tub, place take out orders, etc. They had rose petals all over our hotel suite when we checked in with a bottle of Santorini wine. The service we had was probably the best service we've had anywhere. Highly recommend",0
"Breathtaking views of the Caldera, and very friendly hosts (Athina, and her mum). Thanks Melanie for taking care of our reservations and car transfer so efficiently. Thank you Athina for the recommendations on restaurants, where to go around the island, helping us with our car hire and getting taxis for us, etc. We stayed at Alexander House and we love just chilling out at the balcony for the beautiful unobstructed Caldera views. The hotel is so well located - makes it so easy to explore Oia by foot. Highly recommended!",0
"Our third visit to Santorini, our first here at Atrina Traditional Houses.We stayed here in May, spending a week loving every minute of our blissful holiday. From the moment of waking in the spotlessly clean rooms, with every comfort covered, to the time we turned the lights out, we were incredibly happy.Nothing was too much for the charming staff, (who made us so welcome and treated me to a beautiful cake on my birthday!!) light bulbs changed immediately, rooms cleaned to perfection daily, and who can argue with breakfast on one's own balcony, carried shoulder-high by a handsome Adonis with a huge grin, daily? The breakfasts were so tasty, all thoughts of refusing anything served quickly forgotten. I still dream of that amazing yoghurt with fresh fruit!!The pool was refreshingly cool and very clean, the poolside food very delicious!The beds were comfortable, (with lovely linen) the balcony loungers too!Atrina Traditional Houses are placed in the best part of Oia, within easy walking distance to the central areas with all the fabulous restaurants, but away from the main tourist drag, so not too busy!The views from the balcony were stunning; it was so difficult to turn our gaze away to the books we brought with us!We came home so relaxed, and so happy!Would we return? Already dreaming about it....!   Room Tip: Athena's House is where we stayed, it was very private xx See more room tips",0
"First and foremost, there is Athina, Melanie, their adorable mother and all the hotel staff who made our stay an exceptionally delightful experience. Then the hotel, perfectly located on the most sought after section of Oia’s pedestrian strip. Upon arrival we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of Santorini white wine and a fruit basket. Our rooms (we had two) were simply gorgeous, very spacious, well-appointed and with large terraces offering a stunning unobstructed view of the caldera. There can’t be a better viewpoint than that. Breakfast is excellent and served on your terrace every morning so you can indulge yourself while contemplating the lagoon. Wi-Fi was fast and worked perfectly. There is even a free parking close to the hotel - a rarity in Oia - should you decide to rent a car to explore the island (parking belongs to car rental company and only their cars can be parked on the premise).I highly recommend this flawless hotel ",0
"Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful and breathtaking views. Wonderful breakfast delivered to your veranda. A place for romance . Our first visit to Santorini, but when we return it will be to Atrina.",0
"I highly recommend Atrina Traditional Houses. Me and my husband spent 4 amazing days there. The hotel staff reserved tours, scooter and dinner for us, explaining all we needed to know about anything we asked. The room is amazing and gave us a true OIA experience. I also need to comment about an specific event: we had a scooter accident in Santorini and we had the best support anyone could give with the hotel staff. Athina arranged a car to take us to the hospital and accompanied us there the whole way, stood there with us all the time and assisted us in all the possible ways. So I can say that we had a lot more than we expected.",0
"Stayed four nights at impeccable traditional cave house villa. Separate kitchen, dinning room, living room and two bathrooms were a plus in Oia. Service was seamless and flawless. If they improve their breakfast to offer more variety and options, we would have no problem giving it a five star.",1
"The level of service is superb, everything done with a smile. Its in the center of Oia village, but very quiet as well. The staff is so nice, and the breakfast delivered to your terrace is extremely generous!This was the second time I stayed there and cannot imagine booking anywhere else ion the future!!",0
Everything from room to service was amazing. Made our trip in Santorni amazing. Location was even better than advertised. Would not stay anywhere else on the island if we visit again. Even surprised me with a birthday cake!,0
"We enjoyed our time at Atrina immensely! We stayed at Tholos house, which had a nice living room, bathroom and a sleeping area, all were very nice, clean and spacious. There is also a kitchenette which we barely used. The view from the balcony was amazing. Just incredible.The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating, including my need for a gluten-free breakfast.The only con I can think of was that water pressure in the shower wasn't very strong but it didn't really bother us.The pool, like all pools in the hotels around Oia is relatively small but has a great view. Also, note that like any other hotel around, there is very little privacy in the balconies etc, don't expect a secluded room with no one walking around or being able to see you. Oia just isn't built that way.Also - like any other place with the caldera view in Oia, you'll be looking south so no sunsets to be seen from the balcony. But the view, as I said, is to die for.Lastly, prices for drinks are rather expensive (as is all of Oia) but you can always buy things in the small supermarket very close by.I would stay here again and again!   Room Tip: They all seemed great. We enjoyed Tholos. See more room tips",0
"We had lovely stay! Service like you had a housekeeper.Gorgeous view and perfect location. If you go with kids, definitely recommend you book a room with Jacuzzi.Kids enjoy the water and you enjoy the view.If you go couple, I think there is a wonderful and romantic place to stay",0
"We were very pleased with our recent vacation in Oia at Atrina. Our family of 4 stayed in the Cavana 1894 suite and were very comfortable. I investigated other properties but the next level up was almost double the $ and I am not sure what they offered that Atrina didn’t have. The location is excellent at the beginning of the Caudera and the view is spectacular from the pool, your balcony, etc. High end amenities and wonderful service, including making reservations at local restaurants. In particular I wanted to mention a situation that I had with my booking and how graciously it was handled. The challenge with planning a vacation in Greece is logistics-many different hotels, ferry schedules, etc. I had made an error and wanted to extend my time in Crete and shorten my stay in Santorini. I was informed that there was a 3 night minimum and I was liable for 3 nights. They listed the extra night as available but it did not rent. So I paid for 3 nights and only used 2. When we arrived I told them that I would appreciate a late check out as we had an 11:15 PM flight. They agreed that they would try their best. On our last day they told us to stay in our room until 2:00 PM, when another family was checking in, but that if we packed our bags they would move us to the empty suite next door (which they had cleaned that day after a family left) and we could stay, take showers, enjoy the pool, go to dinner. This was HUGE for us, as it allowed us to have a full last day before we left Santorini. I was very appreciative of the fact that they recognized that I had paid for a room I didn’t use and that they tried to make it fair. To me that is great, memorable service.   Room Tip: I think every room has great view. Ours was the lowest so required more steps but not a problem for... See more room tips",0
"This place isn't cheap and the rooms are very traditional, the view is amazing and the staff are both friendly and helpful. It is well located near to shops and restaurants but retains enough distance that you feel secluded. It's quiet and peaceful and very relaxed. Recommended to take a katamaran out on the 5 hour trip, well worth 140 euros of anyone's money",0
"Atrina Canava is where you want to be if you are coming to Santorini! We were staying as a family in the Junior Suite (which is their largest villa) for 4 days in May 2016. LOCATIONIn the heart of Oia! You are in the best part of the island AND you have privacy as well. Oia is the gem of Santorini, this is where you want to be! There's a supermarket 1 min away and the bus stop is 2 mins away and you are in the heart of the shopping area.THE SUITESAs I said we were in the Junior Suite. 2 bedrooms, a spacious living room, a bathroom, a well-equipped kitchen and a patio. See the pictures, it looks exactly the same, maybe even better in-person. The villa was clean which white starched linen replaced everyday and very good quality of toiletries were provided every day.The kitchen was very well-equipped.The pool was one level below.Amazing view!Breakfast has a great spread :)STAFFNow this factor makes Atrina Canava unforgettable. The Staff is so courteous, hard-working and every ready to help! Kudos to Athena (Owner) for finding such lovely and happy people who make her place lively. Athena herself was wonderful, ever-smiling and gave us our orientation tour and made us feel comfortable in general.Costa is the muscular guy you'll see during your stay around lifting 2/3 and sometimes 6 bags by himself, great stamina! X-FACTORThese are little things which go a long way.... They provide you with mobile phones with a local number so you can call the reception/housekeeping or your friends in the other room. A complimentary bottle of very nice wine.A map and a magazine with things to do in Santorini.They allow nearby restaurants to deliver meals in case you'd like one.I will definitely be back!   Room Tip: All the suites/rooms/villas have a view of the Caldera.. See more room tips",1
We had a wonderful stay. The Studio was spacious and very comfortable. Incredible view of the Caldera. Athena and the staff made us feel very welcome. The pool was practically empty every day so it felt like it was totally private. It was very quiet. The breakfasts were great. Athena made all our travel/rent-a-car and dinner reservations as well as great suggestions for where to go. There was a slight issue with the water pressure in the shower. We told the management about the problem that they were not aware of. The problem was addressed and fixed as soon as it was brought up. Sometimes there are issues with the town water supply apparently. It wasn't the fault of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and it's well worth the price. it made our stay in Santorini magical.,0
"I can only summarize our experience in Atrina Villa as follows:E X C E P T I O N A L hospitality...O U T S T A N D I N G hotel…F A B U L O U S location...S P E C T A C U L A R views…S U P E R B breakfast...U N R I V A L E D service…B R I L L I A N T recommendations…S E C O N D T O N O N E.Note: Our family of five arrived June 21, 2015 and left June 26, 2015 (not July.) I apologize to the beautiful Atrina family... Athina, 'Mom' Melanie and everyone for an unforgettable experience, for testing your patience, and for a late review.   Room Tip: I believe all have a wonderful view.. See more room tips",0
"My husband and i stayed in the Alexander room for 4 nights on the 4 of june. This was a last minute booking and at the time i think i got the last room for that week. It did not let us down at all!!! The hotels loction is perfect, close to all the shops and resturants, the food at the pool bar was really well prieced and tasted great as did breakfast. The rooms where large and really clean and the view every morning was amazing! Couldnt recommend this hotel enough! It was worth every penny, staff where always smiling and at hand to help with anything you may need. Brilliant work Atrina, thanks for a wonderful stay in Oia.",1
"Best way to sum up our experience at Atrina Houses. We started our vacation in Greece with three nights here. After a long flight with a couple stops it was great to have their pre-arranged car service meet us at the airport. The driver was very friendly, our first of many encounters with the super friendly Greeks. Our room with patio overlooking the cauldron was tastefully decorated and the arrival bottle of wine was a nice surprise. Breakfast every morning on the patio with the amazing views was the perfect start to the day. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The location near the start of the main street in Oia was convenient as it is very easy to walk around. As my wife said, we could have just moved in and lived there. Only drawback to some might be the location of the TV (which we never turned on the whole week in Greece). If we return to Santorini we will return here without a doubt.",0
"Atrina Traditional Houses is exactly that! Lovely cave houses restored and run by the familyThe hotel has an excellent location at Oia - just at the start of the boulevard and away from the crowds that come on the cruises yet close to all the action Very well kept, very helpful staff and excellent views of the Aegean Sea Athina was very helpful with all activities - sunset cruise, car bookings and restaurants We do hope to come back someday!   Room Tip: Canava is a great room with kids See more room tips",0
"We cannot say enough good things about the great people at Atrina. Clearly the setting is spectacular (and Atrina has some of the best views), but honestly our experience with the Atrina family is what made the trip so special. Everyone who works at the hotel is so, so friendly and eager to help. They will recommend the best places to eat, see the sunset, wine tours, etc. They will even call and make reservations and set up a car for you.One of the coolest aspects is that they provide you with a phone that will work anywhere on the island in case you need to call for help, transportation, restaurant advice, etc. You also use this phone to order breakfast each morning (complimentary and unbelievably good) and room service anytime you want.We stayed for a week, and on day 3 we were already trying to figure out when we could return to Oia and to Atrina. Best trip ever. Do it now, stay here, you won't regret it.",0
"I can't say enough about this place. It was heaven. Leave you 5 star, high riser hotels and come here. This hotel shows you how its done and what really matters. Firstly, it was just like the pictures. Secondly, room in a white painted cave, modern and yet just so exotic. Thirdly, breakfast on the balcony with the beautiful blue sea view. Fourthly, ok...i know it was vacation time but the wifi was great. Finally, just walk up the white stairs and you're at the shopping street. You have the pool as well among the cave structure walk/stairs. The reception was amazing, it was another small cave that was so cute and chic. Bottom line, colour anything white and blue, you get a clean, bright and modern concept even if it's a cave structure. So do you need a fancy hotel, reception and poolside? Go to Oia and stay here, you'll be amazed! Just small recommendations to the hotel, why not have a small cosy restaurant as well (some do) and just curious, since Oia plumbing doesn't dissolve toilet paper, why not fix tabs. Apart from that, kuddos!   Room Tip: Every room is facing the sea. So its heaven. See more room tips",0
"We decided on santorini for our honeymoon break. Due to us having a small child we chose to only go for 4 nights. We booked atrina traditional houses following reviews from other users and we are so glad we did. We stopped in Xenonas honeymoon suite and had a private balcony/terrace and jacuzzi, directly overlooking the caldera. The views were amazing and photos do not do it justice. All the staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast every morning on our terrace which was amazing and we couldn't finish it! The food from the pool bar was of an equal high standard and of the same portion size.We booked a catamaran cruise and a restaurant through the reception and all were well organised. We didn't have to lift a finger for the whole time. The place was spotlessly clean. Only slight fault was the shower was not all that powerful. However we are really nit picking here. If you chose to go to santorini this place should be at the top of your list. Relaxing, friendly, informal and at the same time exceptionally high standards.",0
"This was a wonderful, wonderful stay. We stayed in Marina's Suite for four nights last week. The room had a spacious seating area, comfortable bed, and large bathroom. The view from the room was absolutely breathtaking, and there was a patio area with two lounge chairs and a table with two chairs for breakfast. The property is wonderfully designed and immaculately maintained. The pool isn't huge (none in Santorini seem to be) - but it had an amazing view and was well attended.The staff couldn't have been lovelier or more helpful. They arranged for a seamless transfer from the airport, and had staff meet us to help with our luggage (it is a short walk from the main road down the main pedestrian walkway in Oia to the hotel). Every morning a lovely breakfast was served overlooking the most beautiful sites of Santorini on our patio under the shade of our umbrella (heaven!)! There was a choice of three breakfasts - I preferred continental breakfast (greek yogurt with sage honey, fresh fruit, coffee or tea, and a wonderful bread basket). The front desk was extremely helpful in printing and scanning some business documents I needed to have signed and scanned, and I didn't have any issues with wifi access. The property also helped us arrange a rental car for a day that was extremely easy and cheaper than any rates we were looking at online. I will note in particular that the staff was wonderful in accommodating and arranging our last day in Santorini - we had a later flight out - and they were able to extend our checkout a bit, hold our luggage, and arrange transfers for us to/from the local Sigalas winery. Truly 5-star service! The location for Atrina Traditional Houses was the best you could ask for. Oia is by far the nicest part of Santorini (when you see pictures of Santorini - you're really seeing pictures of Oia). The hotel is right off of the main pedestrian walkway in town (our room was two flights of stairs down from the main road - which seemed quite reasonable compared to some other hotels that seemed to be located much further down than the Atrina Traditional Houses). In addition, I would say that the privacy was good for Oia (you are still in a village, so it's not like you are miles away from your closest neighbor - but it appeared very private compared to some of the other properties in town).Bottom Line: Santorini is amazing - Oia is the best part of Santorini - and I can't imagine a better hotel than Atrina Traditional Houses in Oia!",2
A brilliant hotel located in a great spot in Oia. It is close to many good restaurants but manage to be quiet at all time. Room may not be luxurious but are very cosy. Service is top notch and staffs are very friendly. Nice breakfast at the balcony with a view to die for.I will definitely come back to this hotel!,0
"Forgot to say Rena and all the staff make your stay, breakfast is always special, so love this island and the people, special place, as is the history, you have to see it, a must see,My name is Ron t, from EnglandWill be back very soon, to enjoy breakfast, sun and friendly service.",0
"The hotel (we booked Tholos room) is marvelous, tall, nice, splendid view, extremely calm althoug the hotel is situated in the pedestrian zone. No bar, nor restaurant within 100m which means that you are not disturbed by tourists, party noise, etc.And yet so close to a bunch of excellent restaurants.The hotel is situated in the pedestrian of the most pittoresque town (Oia) of Santorini.With sun on our calm private terrasse from breakfast to 1 hour before sunset.The terrasse cannot be seen from the street and you get the impression the island is all yours.We enjoyed the classical greek salad (excellent ingredients, big portion, bottle of water for free) every day at the poolbar or at our private terrasse.   Room Tip: Tholos room See more room tips",0
"This was our first stop on our honeymoon in Greece and it was absolutely picture perfect. The location is drop-dead gorgeous and from the moment we arrived we felt completely relaxed. Highly, highly recommend staying here!",0
These Traditional Houses are in a great location in Oia. The views are splendid. The Cave rooms are all beautifully decorated with quality furnishings. The bedding and towels are pure white and smell wonderfully fresh. All the staff are friendly and helpful which contributed in making our first visit to Santorini a everything we could have dreamed for. We will be back,2
Excellent in every way! One of the nicest stays we've ever had. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left - had not a thing to complain about. The owner as well as all the staff were enormously helpful and extremely warm. This is one of those places that surpasses even the highest expectations!,0
"We love Greece and for 2016 Easter we decided to come back to Santorini. We stayed in Atrina house and the experience was outstanding. Just four things to mention: gorgeous views, extremely clean, comfy breakfast and friendly people.I would definitely choose Atrina for our next trip to Santorini (I would bet on our return in 2018).On the negative side: I cannot thing to anything<",0
Hotel location is fantastic as are the staff. The houses are comfortable and well thought out. Breakfast on your balcony is on demand but very swift service and the food is tasty and plentiful. Cannot recommend the staff enough though they really made our stay special,0
"Great hotel killer view, good food and the beat service in oia. The breakfast in the room terrace was amazing. Our trip got delayed duento weather and they let us checkin early on thenext day. Also the concierge helped us book a catamaran to see the sunset it was incredible",0
"I don't think I could have dreamed up a more incredible experience in Santorini! My husband and I came here for part of our honey moon and we could not have left more in love with the island. Athina was AMAZING- so helpful, gave great recommendations, and basically took care of everything for us. Roger was waiting for us to bring our bags to our room even though our flight didn't land until after midnight, and he was waiting by our door to lug our suitcases back up to our car when we checked out. The breakfast on the balcony every morning is a perfect way to start your day and the chocolates they leave on the pillows are TO DIE FOR! Fantastic location in Oia right on the strip but out of the busier streets of Oia. Everything was very clean as well (rooms, pool area, lobby, balconies). We could not be more pleased that we chose to stay here! I cried when we had to leave (really). Thank you Atrina houses for being such a huge part of such a wonderful memory!",1
"Amazing hotel, beautifully decorated rooms and very helpful staff. Loved the breakfast on the terrace which was definitely the best part. We will come back again. The hotel is also suitable located for a short walk to the Oia high street and the castle.",0
"Are you sure???How many times have you wondered if you plan correctly? Starting my vacation to a unknown hotel I was anxious to see if I chose wisely. Thankfully Greek Gods favored me. A delightful value for money deal was expecting me. Nice rooms( don't get crazy) wonderful view, and a cozy staff looking forward to attend to your needs. Minus... Stairs, stairs and stairs",0
"This hotel and its location cannot be beat! The view of the caldera is wonderful and you're within walking distance to everything in Oia. The rooms I can't even describe they are so beautiful. I was upgraded from the studio to the Irene suite (probably because it was the off season, but still nice of them to do). All of the little details in the room are amazing. I had a bottle of Santorini wine waiting for me in the room on arrival. The balconies have spectacular views for breakfast. Even whatever they wash the laundry in smells like heaven! They're pretty helpful once you're there with setting up sightseeing (weren't so helpful over the phone, but good once I got there). I'd recommend renting a car to get around the island and taking the sunset catamaran trip with the Santorini yacht club. Both were very reasonably priced ($45/ day for the car, $150 for a 4 hr cruise with car transfer, an amazing dinner, and snorkeling). The staff helped me set up both the car rental and the sailing trip from their front office. They also let me stay in the room a little longer when I wasn't feeling well, but I wasn't scheduled to leave Santorini until 4pm that day. My only complaints would be that room service takes forever (my ice cream was soup by the time it got to me) and they really need to upgrade their poolside furniture, it's pretty worn down. The living room furniture is also designed to be more decorative than comfortable, but the bed is very comfortable and for me that is what was important. Overall, an amazing place to stay!! I wish I would have stayed there longer!",2
"We stayed at Atrina Traditional Houses five years ago, but my memories have not dimmed. I have always wanted to write this review because it was such an exceptional experience, but time intervened. So finally....The beauty cannot be captured in the photos. Although located on the busy tourist street in Santorini, it is at the beginning of the road, and tucked away from all the commotion. The rooms are magnificently simple and elegant at the same time. They are situated in such a way that a sense of total privacy is created. The views, of course, are legendary.But equally special were the owners. Their warmth and charm were as delightful as the scenery we feasted upon. Our visit to Santorini was memorable as much due to them, as to their uniquely beautiful place. We would love to visit again one day.",0
"We stayed for a week and didn't want to leave. We were even treated to an overnight thunderstorm - watching lightning in the caldera was fascinating. The rooms are big and spotlessly clean. The outside area is something of a suntrap, so don't expect to be able to find any shade would be my only comment. Breakfast was huge and freshly made to order, served outdoors where the view could be suitably marvelled at. The pedestrian area of Oia is a few steps away with a wealth of restaurants to choose from. As with all of Oia, there are many steps, so it's not for anyone with mobility problems (or severe vertigo....) but just about flawless in every way.   Room Tip: Review the website as the rooms do differ. Some have access across the patio for other guests to rea... See more room tips",3
"I don't think I had experienced such beauty until staying at Atrina Traditional Houses in Oia, wow! It was amazing. The location is simply stunning with an amazing view of the Caldera.Breakfast is served on your balcony, and while the breakfast is fairly basic, its just an amazing experience to sit there in relaxation in that environment.The pool is nice (if not a bit cold), and thats really it for the hotel grounds apart from the small reception room at the top. As the area is quite steep on the side of the Caldera, there are some stairs, but all part of the experience. Staff were friendly and helped us with some questions, and they have a cute dog in the reception too! It's in a perfect location as well, with Oia needing to be seen to be believed. It's also down the quieter end of town, so there's not too many people loitering around which is good.Can't say much more really, just do yourself a favour and book it in as soon as you can!   Room Tip: We stayed in Alexander's room which I believe is the most basic room, but it was beautiful and t... See more room tips",4
No words can fully describe this truly amazing place. We stayed early May and had an unforgettable time. Not one complaint..fabulous memories and wonderful staff. Breakfast just isn't the same anymore and the view from the jacuzzi is forever etched in my mind :) One day hopefully we can get back,2
"We stayed here for our honeymoon and were just stunned by the incredible views of the caldera and Oia from our suite. Between the great breakfast and our time at the pool, we easily spent more than half of each day at the property and the staff was wonderful and attentive throughout our stay. Atrina is also perfectly located in Oia so that it is very accessible to the shopping and restaurants but still has a degree of serenity. Highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Oia!",3
"Everything was amazing.The place,the room,the place,the room service,the breakfast,the staff and the reception staff especially Athina..5 stars for this paradise.If you planning vacations in Oia try first of all to have a room at Atrina.Best experience in my life.",2
"First, if you are going to Santorini, the best location to stay at is Oia. It is at the farthest end of the island where people from everywhere come to watch the sunset. It has a pedestrian walkway full of restaurants, shop, groceries, coffee shops...Don't get turned off by the airport. Don't even get nervous of the towns outside the airport. Second, if you are staying in Oia, stay at one of the hotels on the pedestrian walkway and you will never need a car or venture outside for foods. Lastly, if you are looking at hotels on pedestrian walkway then Atrina Traditional Houses is your best choice. Here is why:LOCATION: The best. Near the beginning of the pedestrian walkway so you don't have to walk far from the street. At the wider part of pedestrian walkway so not as crowded and loud. There is a small grocery store next door. Atrina is off the cliff with some caved houses (at the bottom) that are extremely unique. The view is to die for. As mentioned, you can walk the pedestrian walkway for many restaurants, shop to include SOHO and many Greek designers shops, bakeries...HOTEL/ROOM: It is a family owned boutique hotel with about 16 units from studio to villas. Most accommodate 2 with the exception of 2 that can accommodate up to 4. The check area is small but there is always someone there to help. We got handed a cell phone with buttons to connect to front desk and room service. We were told to take it with us when leaving the room in case we need to be connected to them. There is a nice size pool in the middle of the property with lounge chairs around and pool services.We stayed in Atrina Villa , the largest unit they have. the room was amazing and unique with large kitchen and dinning area along with an additional bedroom and 2 full bath, the living room was large and comfortable. We never watched TV our entire stay but did use the CD player to play the beautiful musics they had in the room. The complimentary internet was okay, better signal in some rooms and not others (we were in the cave, people, so totally expected it) the Jacuzzi outside was a bonus but the best of all was the lounge chairs/umbrella, dinning tables and chairs on the patio (just for our villa) overlooking the magnificent caldera. We had the most delicious breakfast prepared, delivered and set up on our patio dinning table every morning. The housekeeping ladies did a superb job. They swept, mopped our patio everyday and replenished towels that were left on the lounge chairs. Please note that room humidity can be high due to the fact that it was a caved house.SERVICE: Could easily be one of the highlights at Atrina. They arranged bellman to meet us on the street where we got dropped off and carried all of our luggage in. After checking in, the bellman carried our luggage down those steep steps and delivered them to our room. No sweat on our part. The bellman I mentioned (mad for not getting his name) was also the gentleman who delivered breakfast every morning. He was always prompt and polite and helpful. I should mention that they had a very nice and expensive bottle of wince in the room waiting for us (not your typically free champagne). When we called to inform them of our checking out time, they sent bellman to bring our luggage up. Superb service.FOOD/BREAKFAST: 3 breakfast choices came with the room rate. The were Greek (with Greek yogurt, salami and different cold cuts including cheese), American and English. All came with coffee, tea or milk (for kids) and fresh squeeze juices, along with eggs (your choice of preparation) pastries and meat choices (depending on the package you pick). They also had a light room service menu for snacks, coffee, mixed drinks, liquor and beer (the same served at the pool). OVERALL: In my opinion, this was one of the best places to stay in Santorini for location, view and service.",10
"We had an amazing week-long stay at Atrina earlier this month for our 30th anniversary, and we are still talking about it! Athena and the staff here are friendly, warm, and at your service any time of the day or night. We stayed in Canava 1894, which is situated at the very bottom of the property just above the pool. This particular ""house"" is built into the cave and features a huge lava rock in the middle of the living room. The beds and furnishings were comfortable, and the kitchenette with fridge and stovetop came in espcecially handy. There were unobstructed views for 180 degrees, and the sunsets were breathtaking almost every night. Breakfast is included with your room,and is brought to your patio table each morning and was always fresh and delicious. From the fresh fruit to the French press coffee, we enjoyed having our meal overlooking the Caldera and sharing time with the local cats who visit every day. Athena and the others who work here guided us to dinner, made boat reservations for us, and provided us with the bus schedule and taxis at a moment's notice. I cannot say enough good things about this place! It was like staying at heaven on earth. I hope to return some day! My only caution is there are MANY stairs, no handrails, and uneven steps. If you are at all limited in your mobility, I suggest you request a room at the top of the property.   Room Tip: Canava 1894 is private, but down 5 flights of stairs. Perfect for two couples. If mobility is an is... See more room tips",1
"Atrina is a great choice in Santorini. No doubts about it. #1: The location, overlooking the caldera (superb views!) and right at the beginning of the pedestrian walkway in Oia. Very close to shops and where you have to pick up the local buses for going anywhere else in the island.#2: The service was impeccable. Right from reservation time, Melanie was most responsive and helpful. Our car for the pickup and drop to the airport was on time with courteous and friendly drivers. Athina at the reception was tremendously efficient kind and helpful. We were upgraded to a larger room (a suite called Athinas) even though we had only booked a studio. Athina gave us a lot of tips on things to see and do. Made it very easy for us to enjoy Santorini. The breakfast was excellent and served in our room. They took the trouble to pack us a breakfast for our early morning departure as well, which was so great.There were lots of other small touches which made the stay special...too numerous to mention.You cannot do better in Santorini. Don't think twice before booking your stay at Atrina.",1
"The service, room, amenities and staff were all second to none, topped off by the most stunning view of the caldera. Breakfast was amazing, on the balcony every morning, service always with a smile. Great service from the reception staff when coordinating restaurant reservations and recommending hotspots for our day trip out in the hire car, this was also arranged by the hotel staff.The only negative I can think of was the annoyingly small iron and ironing board, pretty useless to be fair.I would definitely recommend Alexander's house, the amazing view could even be seen from my bed! I would recommend this house due to the fact that it has a private entry and stairs shared only with its neighbour Mealainie's, this mean a lot less foot traffic and other residents passing by, a private balcony for sunbathing was ideal. I will be choosing this room again for my next visit.   Room Tip: Alexander's house. See more room tips",1
"After nearly four weeks on the road, Atrina is the perfect retreat for us to relax and recuperate. Great location and easy access. First class and authentic room deco. We didn't need to leave the hotel to view the best sunrise and sunset. Moreover, the staff were very warm and attentive. The manager even took trouble to get up very early(4am) in the morning and make breakfast box for us. Eventhough it is a bit pricey, but it worth every penny. I would recommend to anyone who wishes to travel to Santorini.   Room Tip: each room is different. you can use the photos from the hotel website as a reference. See more room tips",1
"I absolutely love this hotel and it's the best place to stay especially if travelling with children. So many of the cliffside hotels in Oia do not allow children under 16, so our options were limited. At the same time, the property is intimate with a small number of rooms, so it's not like there are kids running all over. The pool is amazing, great views, drinks, food. The customer service at this hotel cannot be beat. Every single staff member is helpful and ready to assist with anything you need. We stayed in the Xenonas Suite and I highly recommend that room for the private patio/balcony alone. Breakfast is served on your patio each morning. They will arrange car service for you if needed to/from the port or airport. They arranged a private driver for us to go see some sites and beaches... and also arranged a table reservation for us to have a sunset view dinner. We felt like family at this place and I will definitely be back. The location is also perfect, at the beginning of the busy strip of Oia vs. being in the middle of the crowds. Love, love, love Atrina Traditional Houses.   Room Tip: Xenonas Suite is the best, very private See more room tips",1
The staff and accommodations at Atrina can't be beat. They were very attentive and helpful on coordinating all of our reservations and activities in Santorini. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa - simply lovely. Spacious and well done. They served a delicious breakfast on our terrace every morning. We would definitely stay at Atrina again here and give it the highest rating. Don't bother looking anywhere else.,0
"Hard to believe a CAVE can be so beautiful! Staff is wonderful. Pool refreshing. Oia a dream. One caution... stairs, stairs, stairs! It was 56 steps down to our magnificent suite and 36 more to the gorgeous pool! It's worth every step, but just be aware. The view is magnificent!",0
"We chose the Atrina villas because of the great reviews we read on TripAdviser. The praise could not be more accurate. Unbelievable view, wonderful hospitality. They went above and beyond including serving breakfast on our balcony at 5:30 am because we had to catch an early flight back to Athens! Also a generally great location -- easy to get to taxis or tour pick ups.",0
"We came for our honeymoon. Fantastic hotel all around, one of the best we have experienced.Location, food, view, service and pool is perfect. Would definitely stay again, and recommend anyone coming to Santorini to come. Also, a lovely and delicious bottle of wine was gifted to us on arrival. A great welcome.",0
Thoroughly enjoyed our time at Pezoules. All the staff were excellent - Niko was super friendly and helpful. Dimitri was a great help - showing us things to do and places to go and recommended great things. We loved pezoules.,0
"We stayed for one week last summer and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. The cave rooms are gorgeous, breakfasts sublime and the staff amazing. We would definitely stay there again. The only downside is that there wasn't a beach close by but a small pool (shared with three other rooms) compensated.",0
"This please is absolute heaven on earth. We stayed in the valeriana room for 1 night and never wanted to leave. Breakfast was brought to our terrace where we could eat and look out at the view. The pool was magnificent, views just picture perfect.Staff were lovely! Air con and wifi were fantastic.One very special mention to the gentleman who carries both our bags at once down and up the stairs in arrival and checkout he was so strong and very very kind!! Perfect stay!",0
"My stay at Pezoules was wonderful. The hospitality, the room, the food, the view everything was all could have dreamed. D'Mitri and his staff are the best. Especially Nick at the pool bar. His wife also prepared a delicious 5 course meal that is worth the extra Euro.",0
"The staff and owner treated like we were royalty! The morning breakfasts served on our terrace were absolutely perfect! The owners wife made us the best Greek pizza we have ever tasted! The pool was and view was stunning! If I ever go back to Oia, Pezoules will be were we stay, as they take care of what ever you need with ANY request! Thank you!!",0
"Stunning views, beautiful rooms, excellent service plus the personal touch of Dimitri, Mirella and staff made for a special vacation. In addition to seeing Santorini, we wanted to chill and relax for a few days and it was so easy not to leave. I chose Pezoules based on its Trip Advisor reviews and would advise the reader to well consider it as well. One of the clearest 5 rating I have ever reviewed",0
"We had a lovely time at Perzoules, the most perfect balance of attentive service and ultimate privacy. The staff were always on hand to help us with reccomendations as well as book transfers and the BEST restaurants. The view was breathtaking especially from sunrise, to sunset and the clearest stars in the sky. Undeniably romatic and an incredible atmosphere. If you want the best stay in santorini then you have found it! We'll for sure be back soon. Thankyou team Perzoules!",0
"My husband and I stayed in the Mantzourana house whilst staying at Pezoules and we could not fault it. It was spacious, clean, decorated beautifully and simply and so comfortable. Everything is of good quality. The bathroom is lovely and spacious but my only issue is that the shower head is hand held and it is very hard to wash your hair (this is more so with ladies with young hair). Bed is very comfortable too.We really loved the fresh and amazingly presented breakfast each morning. Everything tastes so good. The greek yoghurt was delightful. One of the best breakfasts' I've had and I've stayed at some beautiful hotels. We like sunbaking out the front of our terrace, we found it very private even though it was a shared terrace. Walking down to the pool was very close and not inconvenient. The pool is small but lovely and its an infinity pool looking over the sea, so stunning.What makes this hotel a super stand out is the service. The staff are so friendly and helpful. They gave us lots of information on what to do in Santorini and really looked after us as if we were guests in their own home and not the generic hotel feel. We were given a bottle of wine for our honeymoon which was very thoughtful. Your room is also cleaned twice a day. Location of the hotel is perfect, lots of good restaurants close by.Yes, its an expensive stay but it is really worth it. Everywhere in Oia is expensive if you want a bit of luxury - be sure to treat yourself!",1
"I never imagined a hotel of such perfection could exist until my stay at Pezoules. From my very first step into the hotel, I was greeted with such happy, welcoming faces. I felt as if I was home. Every staff member went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and enjoying my holiday. They were attentive to details and very accommodating. Waking up every morning to the breath taking views from our gorgeous cave house was a treat all its own. Enjoying a deliciously prepared breakfast on our private terrace was such an added experience. My favorite aspects were the cleanliness of the entire hotel and of course, the infinity pools. The pools literally sit above ocean.. its something you would think to only exist in a dream! If you want to enjoy Oia at its absolute best, Pezoules will provide that and so much more for you. Pezoules is flawless and charming. I will definitely be back and I would definitely recommend Pezoules to everyone, everywhere looking to travel to Oia.",0
"We honeymooned at Pezoules for two whole weeks! Getting an airport transfer is a must, that way you can get to the hotel easily and they take all your luggage down to your room. Now there are some stairs from the main walking street down to the hotel. The hotel itself also consists of stairs. I liked that aspect however because at least we were getting some exercise!We stayed in the Levanta room, which is the lowest room and the most private. No other guests walk past your room. It also has a jacuzzi which we used every day. The decor is simple and clean, as it's a proper cave room. Bed was comfortable and the shower and bathroom were very nice. The breakfast every morning was one of our favorite things! It's so delicious and just the fact that you can call and have it delivered to your terrace every day and eat it in front of the caldera view is so special. It's very filling and we were never hungry again until dinner time. The staff were so nice and very helpful. I didn't plan anything to do on the island as I was all planned out from the wedding. We were able to book everything we wanted to do through the staff. We did a wine tour, sunset sail, and car rental. They also helped book us reservations for restaurants and all their recommendations were amazing. We didn't eat one bad meal the entire time we were there. They provide you with a great map and information about the island to help you plan what you would want to do, to make the most of your trip to Santorini. I also loved the location of the hotel. It's right in the middle of Oia, but far enough away from the crowded streets. The view of the caldera is so amazing, and although you're not facing the sunset, you'll still go see it about every day, either just watching in the streets, on an excursion, or while eating dinner at the restaurants they book for you. It was a trip of a lifetime and a wonderful start to our marriage. Thank you to all the staff of Pezoules for making our honeymoon so special!",0
I really don't know where to begin with. It was an amazing experience! The guesthouses where very clean and accommodating. The view was nothing but breathtaking. Such a treat to wake up to every morning alongside the deliciously prepared breakfast! The staff was hospitable and friendly always willing to assist in any possible way!! i would definitely return and recommend this hotel.,0
"Pezoules is the loving creation of Dimitri and Mirella and their family. It's not only a spectacular architectural wonder built on the side of the 'caldera' with sweeping curves and eight immaculate appartments. The real difference is that they offer the kind of guest experience which other hotel and hospitality businesses have much to learn from. From the proactive email asking about our arrival in Santorini, to the pick up and collection at Oia by the luggage carrying staff, to the sumptuous breakfast on your private terrace, to the engaging chats and caring recommendations by all the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. Need a set of weighing sales to ensure you are within the weight restrictions of the airline? 5 mins later one arrives in the room. My wife has an intolerance to cow's milk so an entire basin of creamy sheep's yoghurt arrives with breakfast and a careful explanation of everything containing milk. Everything about Pezoules is perfect: location (quiet because lower down from the main high street, but entirely central), the restrained simplicity of the rooms with a few carefully chosen items, the stunning infinity pool, the discrete but thoroughly 'human' moments of contact with all the staff. It really seems they actually care about your well being - their passion for what they do shines through in every chance encounter. We have never spent so long in and around a hotel room in our lives. Great views, jacuzzi on your private terrace always on and warm 24/7, silent air conditioning (in the cave houses you don't really need it even in full summer) great free internet connection (best from any hotel visited so far)...and a welcome back from your trips out like coming back into a family. Santorini is a beautiful place to visit. Staying at Pezoules turns the visit into a magical holiday full of warmth, luxury, attentiveness and stylish surroundings. Thanks Dimitri and Co! And congratulations on creating an experience which is luxurious AND touchingly human. This combination is very rare.",1
"Our stay at Pezoules was perfect from start to end. We stayed for 7 nights from 7th July 16 for our Honeymoon, and we could not have wished for more. We were greeted by Ismail who carried our bags down the steps, which was a talent in itself. Dimitri welcomed us, and gave us some really useful information on the trips we could do whilst in Santorini. The staff were so hardworking and attentive.We opened our room door each morning and looked out at the breathtaking view. Breakfast was amazing, it was such a unique experience to have it brought down to our own private terrace at a time that suited us, and to enjoy it whilst looking out at the caldera. The cave room was gorgeous, and added to the experience. Pezoules had such simplicity, yet it had such a quality feel.Pezoules exceeded our expectation. Yes the steps are steep, yet they are worth it and only add the character and charm. The staff made us feel so welcome, and we loved chatting to them each day. We felt so valued as guests, and we cannot recommend Pezoules highly enough. We hope to return one day, as Santorini is a beautiful island, and Pezoules is a place that dreams are made of.",1
"Staff was very courteous attended very well to all of us.Breakfast menu is to be more spread. It was very little to offer. Jacuzzi is missing WI-Fi connectivity if fine.... Overall Experience is very delightful .....   Room Tip: room was very well placed it was like heaven on the earth, Size of the room is also fine... See more room tips",0
"We just got back from our vacation at Oia and Pezoules. We stayed 6 nights, and have the following pros and cons to entail about the hotell: PROS+ the absolutely best thing about the hotell = the owners/managing couple of the hotell. Their commitment to the guest and dedication to their hotel is unique. It can not be bought, makes all the difference. + the hotel itself; the hotel has only 8 rooms, and all of them have premium Caldera (volcano) view. Our room was one of them with a private jacuzzi, and it was such an exclusive experience to sink in to it at the late sun-hours, and watch the Caldera with a drink. + the location of the hotell; you can not have a better location i Oia. Close to bus/taxi station, close to most well-reviewed restaurangs, close to shopping, close to the best sun-set points. But! at the same time you are totally secluded from all the tourist herds watching down from the pedestrian road. that’s why the location is 5 stars in every aspect. + the staff; I don’t need do drop names, but the staff ware professional and very warm hearted. Social but not to intrusive. Every morning we were served with excellent breakfast; very difficult to cary down so many steps. But never a single complaint, quite the contrary, always asking kindly if we needed something else. + Best breakfast experience; we’ve had so many hotel breakfasts, all over the world, but this one probably beats them all. Of course, having your private breakfast every morning with that great caldera is contributing to such statement. So many things can be said about the particulars of the breakfast, but I’m not going to reveal to much, except that one of the managing couple is personally overseeing each and every breakfast to the guest; never seen or heard such excellent service. + The room; our room was one of 3 with own jacuzzi. But all the rooms come with balcony/varenda with the same breathtaking view of the caldera. The interior of our room was just as beautiful and super fresh as the homepage pictures. The care for details and perfection in our room was very satisfying; and I’m pretty sure it is like that with the rest of the rooms. + The drink and food; the meny is not a very large one, but both the food and the beverages were excellent. Especially the local wines of Santorini were great. Also the prices of the hotel were very low considering the level of perfection of this boutique hotel. You could for instance get a great glas of white/red wine for only 8 € (9 USD).+ The service; not that we had any special requests, but the managing couple were very kind. One example is that we were offered to stay at the pool after check out until transfer was ready around 4 pm. We were offered drinks (on the house) and other assistance to get ready for our departure. + Embodiment of OIA; so much more that can be said of the hotels details, but obviously some of the major pros mentioned above summarizes what Pezoules is all about. It is basically what you expect to have in OIA, harmony and relaxation with excellent service. There are other luxurious hotels nearby, yes, but from what we could se from our balcony, the people who paid twice our rates, at one of the neighboring hotels, were fighting over sun-chairs at the pool. Not very much relaxing and/or classy. CONS- The stairs; to be able to get up to the main (pedestrian) road upstairs, one has to walk about a 50 meters of un-even rocky-stairs. It was not a big deal for us, but older couples or families-with-kids may find it very difficult to walk up-end-down to the hotel.   Room Tip: 3 of the rooms have jacuzzi See more room tips",0
We have just stayed 1 week in a cave house at pezoules which has stunning views of the caldera.it's run by a wonderful man called Dimitri and his family who make you extremely welcome.the service was excellent forget 5/5 I would give 11/10.We stayed in one of only 6 apartments which had a large terrace and hot tub.The room was spacious and comfortable and also cool which is what you want when the temp hits the 30c mark.there is also an infinity pool for keeping you cool overlooking the sea.We could not fault this hotel so much so that we are already looking at going back next year which is not something we do as a rule.give it a try you won't be disappointed.,1
"I feel compelled to write a review here because my husband and I are still absolutely GLOWING from our stay at Pezoules. We were treated with such genuine warmth and caring, like we were the only guests! They contacted us before our stay to ask if there was anything they could assist in coordinating i.e. transfers, restaurant recommendations, tours of the island, etc. They did not push us to do anything and always provided a few recommendations to answer any questions about food or activities according to our tastes and preferences. We told the lovely Loli that we didn't like crowds or organized tours and preferred to explore on our own and have more private experiences. She was able to coordinate a romantic dinner on our terrace (complete with live music playing from the restaurant above!) which was cooked lovingly by Dmitri's (the owner) wife. Each course was served skilfully by Nick, who was an absolute pleasure to talk to and such a gentle and sweet spirit! It was our 6th wedding anniversary and they offered us a much larger cave room (Louisa) with a private terrace overlooking the pool for the first few nights. We could not stop pinching ourselves and staring in disbelief at the views from our terrace while sipping on frappes in the morning. After a few nights, we moved into our original booking, the Ligaria cave room, which was every bit as beautiful and also had a beautiful terrace overlooking the caldera. Every day, several times a day actually, my husband and I would take advantage of the gorgeous infinity pool. We daydream about that pool!!! The hotel is small (only 7 rooms), so it always felt like our own personal pool. One day, Nick surprised us with a bottle of local white wine and congratulated us on 6 years of marriage. I was truly blown away by how much they wanted every moment to feel so special for us! The last evening after dinner, we started conversing with Nick. We asked him so many questions and he indulged us with such a sweet conversation. After some time, we glanced at our phones to realize that we had kept him well past when his shift was over. We apologized and he gently told us not to worry...he was well aware of the time and was happy to continue speaking with us for as long as we did. Honestly...that genuine interest just warmed my heart!!! I usually don't like staying in the same place twice, but I am counting down the days till I can be at Pezoules again with the lovely people that care for it.",0
"We booked this as a 50th birthday treat and it was spectacular. Just remembering it makes you want to go back. The owner, Dimitri, his daughter Ioli and Maro at the reception were all great. Ismail’s baggage carrying skills were phenomenal and you have to see it to understand as was ever-attentive Niko at the pool bar. After talking to Dimitri when making the booking, we decided to pay the extra for a cave room and it was so so worth it!!! What a special experience!! Large, spacious, beautifully decorated – we didn’t want to put our things down to spoil the serenity! The terrace was large – 2 sun beds, 2 chairs, a table and a bench. An amazing cold breakfast is serves there and we looked forward to the special Greek surprise every morning – even the beard and croissants were of a very high quality. One of the best memories was lying on our terrace at night, watching the stars and listening to the live music from the restaurant next door!!The infinity pool, hanging over the sea just below our room was perfect!Great location, right in the centre of Oia –easy walk to anywhere in Oia and Finistri. Bus stop to the rest of the island was also very close and convenient with regular and frequent buses!The team at Pezoules were ever ready with recommendation s to match your interest and budget….making this a really special and memorable trip….   Room Tip: The cave room with terrace was well worth the extra!!! See more room tips",0
"When looking where to book our week in Santorini, we came across this right before booking elsewhere - most booking sites don't include it because you must book through Pezoules' own website, but we were rather curious after reading amazing review after amazing review. We decided to go with Pezoules, and....It truly was amazing! I can honestly say this was the best vacation I have ever had and possibly ever will have (unless I go back!). Everything you read is true - the staff are so kind and helpful, the food is delicious, the location and views are unbeatable. It's the full package at Pezoules!It all starts with Ishmael meeting you at the drop-off point and quite literally carrying all our bags on his back down the steps to the villas. These steps can get rather steep and are uneven, so bless him - we had quite a lot of stuff as this was the end of a month-long trip. The pool bartender, Nick, brings you a delicious welcome drink after settling in. Every morning you get an incredible fresh breakfast on your terrace looking out onto the Caldera (amazing views). The infinity pool is beautiful. The staff catered to every single thing we asked of them - anything you want, they will make it happen. I was truly amazed at how great our stay at Pezoules was. If we ever go back to Santorini, we will certainly be staying here. I fully recommend it.",2
Unbelievable view. Great breakfast. Terrific service levels by all staff. Proactive and organised with transfers and awesome cave room. Couldn't fault a thing. Would recommend pezoulas to anyone in a heartbeat.,0
"We traveled in Greece for a couple of weeks but our memories from Pezoules will last a lifetime. It is located in Oia, which is the best place to stay on the island. Oia is known for its restaurants, shops and optimal sunset views. It gets very crowded, but you can always experience peace and tranquility when staying at Pezoules. Our rooms were great; the pool (view) is spectacular (I never wanted to get out); the breakfasts are delicious and plentiful served on your own terrace; and the owners are wonderful. I highly recommend staying at Pezoules!",0
"Pezoules is pretty much perfect. This boutique hotel in the heart of Oia is elegant without pretension. After sailing the islands around Athens, my fiance and I flew to Santorini to stay with the owner Dimitri and his excellent staff for a week. We had booked the Althea room, which is undoubtedly the most unique accommodation in which we have had the pleasure of staying. The room is a luxurious cave, built into the side of the Caldera. Its private balcony and hot tub provide a stunning view of the entire bay. Aside from the hot tub, our favorite feature: opposite the spacious shower is a window that opens to the bay so you can view the water as the sun sets.The hotel is blissfully set a flight of stairs down (and world away) from the center of the main pedestrian walk in Oia. It is quiet and shields you from the noise. The infinity pool is, frankly, a film location managers dream. Add to this a very attentive bartender serving us Mojitos and, well, heaven. They have breakfast service every morning, which was delivered to our balcony. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cheese, bread, pastries, meat, jams, fresh squeezed juice and coffee, and, each day, a new tasty surprise, which we eagerly anticipated.The staff at Pezoules is, without exception, excellent. They are professional and accommodating, warm and never aloof. When we asked for recommendations they provided excellent advice and suggestions. We were discreetly steered away from certain tourist restaurants (and regretted it when we went anyway) and given great advice when we wanted something local, casual with great food (Roka). Whenever they made reservations for us, we realized that we were given the finest table in the house. If they did not have information handy, the would immediately get it.To illustrate the level of service by way of example, there was one day when I carelessly left my iPhone in the pocket of my swimsuit. With Mojito in hand, I entered the infinity pool and stood chatting with my fiance for 5 minutes or so before I realized what I had done. I jumped out of the pool and when one of the staff saw what happened immediately asked what he could do to help. I asked for a bag of uncooked rice. Within a minute he appeared with a bag of uncooked rice. One of the front of house staff, Ioli, was notified and she came right away. She offered to take the device for me, nearly an hour away, to the other end of the island where she knew of a repair shop. In the intervening period during the repair, she provided updates and acted as the intermediary. Then she travelled back to retrieve the fixed phone and brought it back to me. Dimitri checked in with me several times to ask if there was anything further they could do to help.Dimitri, Mora, Ioli, Tio, Ishmael, Sorin and everyone at Pezoules were warm, genuine, great hosts. We highly recommend Pezoules and would like to provide a few tips:• Pezoules is a boutique hotel and you will receive personal service. Take advantage for the best experience.• If you are looking for a private experience, Pezoules is perfect. If you imagine yourself sitting by a large pool with a swim up bar and dozens of other guests, look elsewhere.• This is not a commercial chain operation with a restaurant and large front-of-house staff. While there is no gym, we got great workouts running the donkey steps down and up from Amoudi bay and doing yoga on the balcony. The 6 mile hike to Fira isn’t bad either. • Speaking of which, Oia is built on the cliffs of the Caldera. It is laced with steep stairs. Pezoules is set into the cliffs and one must use the stairs to get to and from the hotel. If you have trouble getting up and down stairs, Oia in general may not be for you.• Pezoules will arrange a masseuse to come to the room for a single or couple’s massage.• One must go fight the crowds to see the direct sunset at least once over Amoudi Bay, but from then on, enjoy the end of day from your balcony. It is not a direct view of the setting sun, but it is quiet, private and the sky is just as beautiful from the hot tub with a cocktail in your hand.   Room Tip: The Althea room is beautiful, has its own private hot tub and the balcony is fairly private See more room tips",0
"I honestly can't stress enough about how absolutely outstanding this Hotel was. My stay at the Pezoules was by far the most beautiful place I've ever been, The views, the breakfast, the service, the wait staff, all incredible! They deserve more than just 5 stars if i could give them a 100 i would. The Location is in the center or Oia with access to all restaurants and shops which makes staying here very ideal. On our first day of Arrival one of our suit cases didn't make it to the Island so when we arrived to the hotel Ioli the receptionist told us to enjoy our first day and not to worry about it because they would handle it for us, and the very next day the suitcase was waiting for us in our room. Im not sure how they did it, but they did. If your looking for world class service,friendly smiles, amazing location, and heavenly views, then the Pezoules is the choice for you!! - Ernest (ernie) and Christian",0
"There are not enough superlatives to review this wonderful hotel! We came for the first time in 2014 and have been back every year since!The family running this lovely location are all incredible! They take such pride in their beautiful hotel and this love shows in everything they do to make your stay here perfect.Dimitri and his wife are your hosts along with their daughter. All the food is homemade by Dimitris wife who will also do special romantic dinners on your private terrace if requested in advance. The breakfast comes to your terrace as well and is just a call to reception to be delivered at the time you desire.The rooms are immaculate and all have fabulous views of the caldera. The infinity pool is gorgeous and a great place to be with friends or quietly meditate on the beauty that is all around you.With only seven rooms there is a feeling of being in a private home and yet so very close to the walking street and restaurants of Oia only steps away. Our family will definitely be back to Pezoules again and again! It is one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed and we thank Dimitri and his family, as well as an incredible staff, for the wonderful time they showed us. Your kindness andfantastic hospitality is not often found in the world",0
"I would not under any circumstances stay anywhere else. This is a very small property and the personal attention you get from the staff is unrivaled. They went out of their way to accommodate us every step of the way. All of their restaurant recommendations were fantastic and was it a coincidence that when they made the reservations, we ALWAYS got the best seat in the house?? The property was immaculately clean. The breakfast was huge and tasty, with a daily special treat that would make your eyes roll to the back of your head in ecstasy. We stayed in the Althaea suite and used the hot tub daily, at sunset with a glass of the bartender's refreshing Mojitos. The location is fantastic too. It's off the main pedestrian street and incredibly close to everything, but very far removed from the noise and throngs of people. You won't have anyone traipsing through your balcony with a selfie stick (really people, enough with those). A lot of the properties we saw in our walks did not have the same level of privacy or security. There is only one way in, through a gate that passes the front desk, and someone is always there seeing who comes in. The beds were very comfortable, the AC worked perfectly and quietly and we slept deeply every night. If you want a well appointed, romantic, serene property with superbly efficient and friendly staff in a fabulous location overlooking the caldera on the edge of a cliff close to a multitude of restaurants, then stay here!!!   Room Tip: Althaea is very private with it's own hot tub, and just steps from the pool. See more room tips",0
"We traveled as a couple and just completed a 3 night stay last week. I can safely say without hyperbole that this was the most pleasant and welcoming hotel stay we’ve had together or individually. And to give some perspective, I’m a Platinum Starwood Member, which simply implies that I travel more than I would like to admit, mostly for work, but also for pleasure on some very nice properties. Pezoules tops them all, and I’ve stayed at some Category 7+ properties, which is Starwood lingo for really nice places, courtesy of points from work. So, if nothing else, I have some experience traveling for both work and pleasure.I want this to be an informative review and not simply one that shouts, “Greatest Vacation Ever” with little detail, so here goes. I’m going to apologize beforehand as I’m trying to think of some negatives aspects to at least give the perception of balance, but in the end, I may struggle to not sound promotional, but I’ll try to catch myself.Lets first put aside the natural beauty of Santorini and specifically, Oia, as it has a tendency to blind you to the faults that may or may not surround you. It really is that magnificent. There is a reason people simply stop what they are doing to admire the sunset. I can’t say I’ve been to too many places that have that as a daily practice. So, I’m hoping to continue this review pretending that Oia isn’t nearly as beautiful as it is.People: I think the thing that struck me the most about Pezoules isn’t necessarily the very practical elements of the hotel, but what I perceive to be a wonderful culture of accommodation and genuine interest in your experience. There was a refinement without what is usually the associated stuffiness that comes with the pursuit. In other words, everyone we interacted with, be it Dimitri, Ismail, Nick, Sorin (apologize for what is probably a mangling of names), were extremely friendly and engaging but also very, very good at their respective roles. To me, that is the most important factor in your experience while traveling. If you can strike that balance of being extremely good without the formality and stuffiness that sometimes infects it, I think you see the big picture.Hotel Rooms: As they self-describe them, they are “cave rooms” which are sparely decorated. I’m 6’4”, so some of the entrance ways require a small dip of the head, but in the end, they are really cool stylistically and we enjoyed them without question. More importantly, they are also a nice counter balance to environment. During the morning and throughout the day, the sunshine, for good and bad, can feel incredibly intense, but with rooms as they are, its very easy to retreat to a cool, dark place. If you haven’t stayed in a “cave” room, you might connote that with sleeping on rocks and drawing animals on the walls, well let me tell you, its the exact opposite, its a very welcome experience. Its definitely the Ying to the Yang of the intensity of the sun outside. Food: Dimitri’s wife, who’s name I forget (yes, I’m a horrible person), is also the cook, or more appropriately the chef who creates all the creations for breakfast as well as the room and bar menu. She is very, very talented, and unlike the usual breakfast you get at most hotels where you look at it as a source of energy and not pleasure. Her breakfast does both magnificently. There was not a morning where we did not enjoy it thoroughly or finish what was given us. In fact, I think I could have hidden a small person in my suitcase and we could have fed them. Additionally, on two occasions we ordered her pizza, which she makes the dough for, and it was exceptional just as the breakfast was. With regard to drinks, both Sorin and Nick make excellent cocktails and I can certify that through extensive experience drinking them over the 3 days. Overall, food and drink are such that you might actually leave the hotel and return for them, which is contrary to many situations where you want to leave the property to eat and drink. Always a good test for quality.Pool: The one last thing I’m going to comment on is the pool. Its an infinity pool that looks out at the caldera. I dare you to go to the edge and not want to rest your head and just stare out at the scenery for tens of minutes. Its the coolest pool I’ve ever experienced, without question.I hope this was helpful.",2
"We stayed three nights at this wonderful hotel and loved the novelty of being in a cave house. The service, view and daily breakfast were spectacular. The room was clean and comfortable. My only critique would be to add a mounted shower head; it was unpleasant having to lay the handheld attachment down while washing.",0
"We had the pleasure of staying at this memorable boutique hotel for 5 nights in June 2016. We stayed in the Levanta cave room. In all my travels, I have never experienced the level of impeccable service and attention to detail as at the Pezoules. From the moment of arrival you are greeted with staff who literally carry your bags on their shoulders up the hill and down to your room. The entire establishment is impeccably cleaned and maintained. The owners and staff were consistently attentive and took care of our every need ensuring a perfect stay. Could not have imagined or dreamed of a more idyllic location......from the crystal clear infinity pool to the full moon rising over the caldera. It was an experience unmatched by any other. I would be neglectful to not mention the delicious fresh breakfast that is served daily to your private terrace. If you are planning a stay in Oia, there is no need to look any further than the Pezoules.",0
"Our stay at Pezoules was impeccable. The owner and staff have made this place a true hidden gem. It is sophisticated and serene. You really can't beat the value for how wonderful this place is. I wish I could move in! The daily breakfast is amazing. Overall, it was pure luxury!",1
"We (sadly) only had one nights stay at this place, but it was probably our best experience on the island. First of all, the location is simply incredible. It is right where you want to be in Oia, trust me. Second, the cave flats are all completely new, and each one is different. Beautifully carved into the Caldera, and best of all, completely secluded on the very first row, so no one can see you from the paved main street above. This is not a given - we noted when walking around Oia that most of the first-row suites were in fact plainly visible from above. At Pezoules, you are completely left alone which is a nice touch. The suites themselves have everything you could possibly wish for, great bed, beautiful bathroom, small kitchen, beautiful balcony and even a small private jacuzzi. The shared pool is built straight out to the waterfront, which is great for relaxing and pictures. Of course, the view is unbeatable. In general, this is a top top top place to stay, a real gem among what seems to be a lot of similar offerings in Oia. The flight of stairs from the main road of Oia down to Pezoules are quite steep and long. We would recommend arranging for a luggage pickup, this worked like a charm for us. In general the staff is beyond great, incredibly polite and helpful and made every effort to make our stay perfect. The location itself is as said a 10/10 too - as soon as you hit the main street above the suites, you’ll be minutes walk from the windmill, restaurants, Ammoudi Bay and anything else you could wish for. In short, this is a truly superb stay, and likely one of the very best places one can find in Oia, hands down. A couple of things to note: 1) Breakfast is included and is very good. You will have to pay for any coffee that isn’t filter coffee, but this is standard in all hotels on the island. The staff can bring you anything you’d like to top off on the breakfast. It says you”ll have to order eggs extra, but we had two hard boiled eggs at no cost. 2) Ask the staff anything! They’re super friendly! 3) You can’t catch the famous sunset straight from the flats. But you’re minutes away from the best spots on the island. Just walk up the stairs, follow the street a couple of minutes left, and you’ll be on the western side of town, which is where the magic happens. Go early to catch a spot!   Room Tip: Our room was the Levanta cave house which is the most secluded of them all. That's just perfect... See more room tips",0
"Words will fall short in adequately describing this exquisitely unique and absolutely breathtaking accomodation. Nestled in the cliffs of Oia you'll step down and into an otherworldly experience. Everything from the service, the cave/room, the view (the view!) will make you feel like you've reached the pinnacle of vacation stays. We couldn't have dreamt something this special even existed and was a perfect place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.",0
"Unique is the only way to describe Pezoules ,its like staying in a private villa with excellent staff rather than a five star boutique hotel which it certainly is . The owner Dimitri and his family and team become more like friends in a very short period of time and nothing is too much trouble . The owners wife Mirella who is an excellent chef provides a fantastic breakfast which is served every morning on your patio/balcony with the best views of the island . The hotel which only has seven rooms was built four years ago to the highest quality into the side of the caldera , which form a series of caves as the rooms . The rooms are very well appointed and cool even at 40 degrees . The views and the location are the best on the island and close to all amenities . This place is pure quality and we've stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels around the world . When we left we felt we were leaving our friends home , but there is also privacy should you prefer . I can see how they have won the tripadvisor award for the last three years .",0
"Had an amazing experience at Pezoules. Beautiful room and view. The service was impeccable and everyone was very nice and helpful. It's location is perfect, in the middle of oia. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone that's going to santorini. Best hotel I've ever stayed at.   Room Tip: All of the rooms looked fantastic. See more room tips",1
"Ideal honeymoon location. Very private yet so incredibly close to everything that Oia has to offer. We spent three nights here. View is insanely good. The memory of our breakfasts on our terrace will last a lifetime. Terraces give you complete privacy from the tourist Mecca of Oia - for us, you are buying the view, the privacy, the service and the access - you're right in the heart of Oia. Ligaria was a beautiful room set right beside the pool. It felt like the pool was privately ours. Staff are first class; very respectful and attentive. Highly recommend.",0
"My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel. It's clean and well-maintained. The staff was also VERY nice and helpful. We really enjoyed the pool and breakfast on our own veranda with the most amazing view. Also, we had a nice sleep coz the bed was great!",0
My husband and I had an awesome time in Pezoules!!! Extremely nice and helpful staff. I would love to go back in the future for sure. The downside is there are quite a few steep stairs before reaching Pezoules. If you have large suitcase remember to have transfer from airport/ port to the hotel.,0
"If you want to experience a small slice of heaven on earth, go to Pezoules and bring the nicest camera you can get your hands on. It was the most beautiful, breathtaking views I have ever seen or experienced. Regarding the view, to be clear, they face the Caldera (which is south, not west/facing the sunset). However, I would argue the view of the Caldera is WAY better than the westward facing view. To see the sunset is only a 5-10 minute walk away anyway.Pezoules is family owned and operated, and they were all extremely nice, friendly, and hospitable. A special shout-out to ioli...thanks for everything! My wife and I enjoyed talking to and getting to know her, and she also provided some great recommendations for things to do/see and places to eat.The breakfast spread they bring you each morning will make you skip lunch (because of the quantity and quality)! Also, you MUST get one of their homemade pizzas for dinner. Absolutely mouthwatering. We only wish we stayed longer to eat another one!All-in-all, this is my new favorite place on planet earth...I just hope to go back again sometime, and sometime soon!",0
Lovely cave room with view awesome over the caldera Fantastic breakfast served on the balcony with the views The private dinner cooked by the owners wife is superb recommended Do book a transfer from the airport as the hotel is down some steps and the porter from the hotel meets the taxi and carries the bags great service Dimitri the owner and his staff are very hospitable and will advise and book restaurants and toursPhoto tour by Konstantina of k yellow photo was good Dimitri can arrange,0
"I have been fortunate to visit incredible places around the world - Pezoules and Santorini is now at the top of the list. It is a magical place, perfectly located in Oi - you will never forget this place.The very friendly hotel staff take care of you from the moment you arrive, and the high level of care never ends. The small hotel is perched on the side of a spectacular cliff overlooking the caldera with views you will never forget. Just a short walk back up to the main street puts you in the middle of all the action - fantastic restaurants, stores, small bars and more.We stayed in room 3 - I recommend that room. I believe there are even more private rooms with spas but they were not available when we booked. Our room was a sculpted cave; spacious, luxurious and very cool.There is just not enough I could say about Pezoules and Santorini! My wife and I will be back for sure!   Room Tip: Room 3 is more private than some others, but I believe there are some that are even better See more room tips",1
"Words can hardly do justice to the magic of Pezoules and the wonderful people who make it so special. My wife and I enjoyed six nights in this unforgettable place and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It was recommended by my brother and sister-in-law who had been talking fondly about their stay here for two years. WE'RE SO GLAD WE LISTENED! It's beauty, charm and authenticity is outmatched only by the friendly demeanor that underscored the entire experience. The fantastic family who owns and operates the hotel as well as the attentive and engaging staff made us feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. They were incredibly helpful in setting us up with numerous activities on the island and amazing dinners nearby. Even more amazing was the personal touches throughout our stay. Every morning to woke up a thoughtful, delicious private breakfast on our terrace overlooking the water. We sat by a small private bar & pool in the afternoon and slept in a cave each night. It could not have been a cooler experience. We even had a romantic private dinner one evening which was cooked by the owner (an absolute 'must-do' - her cooking is out-of-this-world AMAZING!!). If you're planning on traveling to Santorini, please do yourselves a favor and check out Pezoules. They have our ultimate endorsement. Our sincerest thanks to everyone at Pezoules for all the hard work, hospitality, smiles, laughs & memories and for helping to make our honeymoon unforgettable.Looking forward to seeing all of you again one day!-Mara and Paul   Room Tip: Private suites vary but are all awesome!

"We loved Pezoules! From the time the transfer dropped us off to the time we left everything was just fabulous. Our room was comfortable charming and delightful! The breakfast served was absolutely traditional and fantastic. All of the food that we ordered was delicious and homemade. The pool was every bit as magnificent as I had imagined. I would highly recommend a stay at the zoo l I would highly recommend a stay Pezoules. On a side note I needed to find a dentist for Friday we arrived into Santorini, I spoke with the shuttle driver and by the time I got to the hotel they had organized an appointment for me for that afternoon. In my opinion that is going above and beyond!",0
"Lovely small hotel right on the water. Location is amazing - right on the main pedestrian walk in Oia, but since the rooms are set off the Main Street a bit along the water, they are very peaceful. Be prepared to climb some steps to get to the hotel. There are only 8 rooms here, so the service is excellent. Pezoules gets the little touches right: for example, they greet you with a glass of desert wine when you check in, and a man will help you carry your bags up and down the cobblestone stairs in an amazing feat of strength. He even carried our bags all the way to the bus stop on our last day! Breakfast is served on your patio in the morning and is a delicious spread of Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, breads, and a rotating tray of the day (we had amazing baklava!).   Room Tip: We loved our room, Methos, - the rooms closer to the water are more secluded because others don'... See more room tips",0
"I cannot say enough great things about Pezoules of Oia! My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights earlier this month for our honeymoon and it was amazing! I researched hotels in Santorini for 2 months before our trip and was nervous about picking a hotel based on pictures online, etc. I was so relieved when we arrived, it was even better than the pictures! The owner Dimitri was very pleasant to work with over email before we got there and happily answered all of my questions. He even emailed me a week before our trip and asked what our flight details were for arrival at Santorini airport (we paid for transportation to/from the hotel ahead of time) - this courtesy reminder was helpful as I had forgotten to send and I thought it was very professional of the hotel to ask. Of course when we landed in Santorini, there was a gentleman already there waiting for us to take us to the hotel. We enjoyed meeting Dimitri and his wife in person - they were so lovely to talk to, very nice and accommodating and do a fantastic job running the hotel!The concierge ladies were wonderful throughout our entire stay. Check in was a breeze! We got there earlier than their standard check-in time, however they had our room already ready for us! An attendant met us on the main street and carried our bags all the way down all the stairs to our room for us. Everyone was so friendly, attentive and helpful, from delivering our breakfast each morning to our terrace, coordinating same day laundry service for us and booking our sunset cruise - they were awesome! We enjoyed how they would place a lit lantern on our terrace each night when the sun was going down which added to the already incredible ambiance! They even brought us a complimentary bottle of wine when we checked in as a celebratory welcome for our honeymoon! Needless to say, the service was most impressive! We booked the Althaea suite and it was amazing! We really felt like we had the best room because our terrace was so large! The views were amazing and it was really dreamy to be inside the room and look out at the Caldera from the large open doors and windows! Our terrace was incredible with our own private hot tub! This was our biggest selling point in picking this hotel and we were not disappointed with it! It was spacious and always had a great temperature. At night, the hot tub would be lit up with the most mesmerizing blue light that was so inviting. My husband and I really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub each evening after our eventful days exploring Santorini - an added bonus was listening to the live music play from the adjacent hotel each night! Breakfast each morning on the terrace was very enjoyable with traditional Greek foods - I loved the feta cheese, breads, and greek yogurt!The room itself was really cool and is traditional cave style! It was naturally cooler, so it was very pleasant to sleep. The closet area in the back was sufficient space for us to keep our luggage so it didn't clutter the room. The bed, pillows, and linens were very comfortable and we made use of the lush robes that were provided when we used our hot tub. The shower in the bathroom was great with good hot water pressure and overall the design of the room was not only interesting but added to the specialty of our stay. Everything was first class!Pezoules is centrally located, near the bus station, parking lots and main roads. It's situated between the two big churches and a number of nice restaurants are right around it. During the day, it was fun to see the donkeys carrying passengers up the path from the port which is below the hotel. As with most of the hotels in Oia, Pezoules is built down on the cliff, so there are a number of steep stairs to get to it. However, we found that because it wasn't right off the main street, our stay was much more peaceful and quiet! The stairs are just part of reality when you visit Santorini, so we had no problem with them, however if you're not able to climb stairs easily, then you may want to look for a hotel who's entrance is right off the main street. Lastly, I'll add that we really enjoyed the small size of Pezoules. While I know there were several other guests staying in other rooms, the way the hotel is laid out allows for a lot of privacy. Everything was very quiet and private and we felt like we were the only ones there!So if you're still looking for a hotel in Santorini, stop your search and just book at Pezoules! We would LOVE to come back to this hotel again and will be telling our friends and family to choose Pezoules if their travels ever take them to Santorini!

"We had a hard time choosing among the beautiful hotels over at OIA, but in the end, i went ahead with Pezoules as i thought the design, architecture and location to be more unique and i was blown away at how beautiful it was upon reaching the hotel!. The hotel's location is very private and one that you would enjoy if you value privacy. When we first arrived, we were in awe at how epic and magnificent the view was during our stay there. It's one of the most interesting hotel i stayed at, i guess most of us are more use to living in boutique or the usual 4-5 star hotel and Pezoules is on a total different league and i would say worth every cent that i paid for during my stay there.Breakfastwe weren't expecting a huge spread of Greek breakfast and the Hotel staff were very thoughtful to also prepare us 2 sandwich on the morning of our flight out of Santorini. The location is very centralise to where all the tourist attractions are. finding it might be a problem to some, especially if it is your first time at OIA. Direction to the hotel! Here's some tip to help you guys! go trip adviser and find out where the famous Pitogyros (OIA) is located- there is a carpark and yes you should drop off there, walk up and you should see the Andronis hotel, now walk right until you see the SKALA restaurant. there is a path down with another Excellent restaurant(FLOGA) below. its below FLOGA.",1
"We stayed recently for 4 nights at Pezoules and absolutely loved it! The staff were so friendly & helpful from the moment we arrived! Someone was waiting at the drop off point to carry our case and show us to the hotel ( not sure we would have found the hidden gem otherwise). Our room was simple but beautiful, a very unique cave room! We had a lovely private terrace with a hot tub which was great to relax in after all the walking we did! Also great for watching the boats and seeing the donkeys go up and down. Breakfast every morning was delicious and there was always a surprise element to it too.... A homemade treat! The location of the hotel was just perfect..... Within reach of everything but still tranquil. We were even spoilt with a lovely bottle of wine to help celebrate my birthday which was a nice touch! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Pezoules and hope to return in the future. Forgot to mention the amazing scenery & sunsets at Oia too!",0
"What can i say about Pezoules. We visited this place early of the season and it was really great as it wasn't crowed. Santorini by itself is an island that you should really visit and stay at Pezoules. The view from over there is amazing, breathtaking and you do not want to leave from the hotel. The staff and Ioli were super helpful and the homemade breakfast was one of a kind . Wishing to have the opportunity to come back again",0
"We went here for our honeymoon but honestly did not receive any different treatment than any other regular hotel stays. There was nothing memorable from the hotel service, but the views from the place are great. I think it was a bit overpriced for what we got.",0
"Our first time to Oia, and we chose Pezoules because of the extraordinary architecture and privacy. We chose Cave House Louisa because of the private deck/veranda with spectacular views of the caldera. The owners were on site, as was their artist daughter Ioli, and that made this feel warm and welcoming. Every detail was tended to with a personal touch, never overbearing. The breakfasts were always spectacular and generous, memorable with the homemade special pastries and espresso/capuccino, as well as eggs, fruit salads, local cheeses, the most magnificent cherry tomatoes, olives (need I go on...?). The pool was small but strikingly beautiful. We were there as season was starting, so not too crowded. Some of the rooms have shared terraces, so if you wish compete privacy, ask about that. All details in the rooms are luxuriously appointed. 5+ stars for every aspect - well worth the price, which is somewhat in the ""very special event"" category. But this is so perfectly situated, and yet so private, it is worth every euro. I wish this family-owned and operated resort all best success and we thank them for making our memories so beautiful.   Room Tip: Shared terrace would be great for a family taking out 2 rooms, have breakfast together on veranda wi... See more room tips",0
"If I could, I would rate Pezoules and their staff, much, much higher.From the outset when I was first looking online and had questions, Dimitri, Mina and Ioli were very responsive. After arriving there, they were always so helpful, but in a truly discreet and professional way. My wife and I don't need our hands held as travelers, but when we ask for a great restaurant or in the case of a sailing excursion, we want the best. In every instant, their advice and their help was fabulous. When we started looking at places to stay in Oia, we had certain criteria that had to be met. We wanted a small boutique hotel. We wanted a room that was private and of course we wanted something with a stunning view. Decor and style of the room and hotel were important as well. My wife is an interior designer and has very exacting tastes. When I showed her Pezoules website, she was completely taken with what we would come to think as being a very Santorini style. She liked the fact that the walls were immaculate and uncluttered with art. She loved the subtle use of color, primarily white, grey and blue. It made your eyes go out of the room and absorb the view. As to the view - it was absolutely stunning! Hour by hour it would change with the light and the clouds and each day was visually unique. Every morning we would have breakfast delivered to our patio and soak up the sun and the view while eating the wonderful pastries, eggs, fruit and yogurt that were brought to us. On our last night, we had a romantic dinner that they offer, served to us on our patio. It was exquisite and the best meal of our week long stay in Santorini. It was also one of the most memorable of the entire three plus weeks of our trip.Other notable things:The bed was incredibly comfortable and the sheets were custom made and very soft. If it wasn't for the view, we would have stayed in bed all day. Room lighting and decor were perfect. The infinite edge pool was refreshing in early May and worth plunging in when the air temps were warm enough.I could rave on and on about our experience both at Pezoules and Oia, but perhaps it's best suited for another review. One thing to mention about Pezoules website, it does in fact look exactly like how it is in person. We loved the website and we both feel that it showcases the hotel perfectly. There are still some pleasant surprises to discover when you arrive though...If heaven exists, then I hope it looks just like Pezoules. We never wanted to leave.   Room Tip: The Louisa room was our choice. Fabulous view and private. There are two suites beneath the pool tha... See more room tips",1
"My wife and I spent the better part of a week (6 days 5 nights) in the Levantes Cave Dwelling. I can't express in words the breathtaking view we woke up to each day. Oia is truly paradise on Earth. The view (see attached pictures from our balcony) however beautiful, was overshadowed by the generous hospitality and warm service provided us by the owner, his wife, and daughter who run Pezoules in addition to each and every member of the staff. If I could give more stars I would. Free breakfast every morning consisted of a feast with hand made breads (made every day by the owners wife) fresh fruit with Greek yogurt with sliced turkey and local cheeses. The jacuzzi was cleaned and maintained daily. Every request for our room was met without hesitation. In addition the owner and his family helped us by getting reservations at local restaurants, booking tours, and making general recommendations. I have traveled a lot and have never had people be as helpful or go as far out of their way to create an amazing experience.",1

"This was the third time we stayed at Pezoules of Oia. Once again we found that everything about the hotel is exceptional: from the beautifully decorated rooms and the breathtaking views to the incredible food and the exceptional staff. It is worth noting that the service at Pezoules is impeccable, making our stay there comfortable and special. As mentioned, the food is just great. Mirella prepares the most amazing, fresh dishes, using locally sourced ingredients. For a truly memorable experience we highly recommend the 'romantic dinner for two'. We will definitely visit Pezoules again next year!",0
"Rooms - 10/10, aesthetically perfect and pristine. Cleanliness A+ Food - 10/10, sitting on your deck eating breakfast is a postcard setting with fresh juice, fresh fruit, eggs - probably best inclusive breakfast I've ever had Location - 10/10, ideal central location. NB: As to be expected in Santorini it is a climb up and down to Pezoules Service - 10/10, discreet and personalised! With a homely welcoming feel. My partner and I stayed at Pezoules in August 2014 - I didn't realise I hadn't got around to leaving a review, but had popped on the tripadvisor page to see how Pezoules was going and had to acknowledge this amazing stay!   Room Tip: Any! all amazing we stayed in the highest room directly in front of the reception See more room tips",0
"This hotel was perfect, the crew are perfect and they'll give you all attention you need!About the rooms i have nothing to say, always clean and confortable. The view could not be better, perfect to a romantic couple.If you pretend to go to oia consider take a tim in this hotel.",0
"this place is OMG,, the water, the water and more water. Ok it is only greece but it is an awesome place, and anyone who is thinking of coming then just pack your bags and get here, it is amaxing, good for honeymoon and making babies.   Room Tip: ask for honeymood suite See more room tips",1
"I can't even start describing how unique my experience at Pezoules has been. The owners and staff are extremely friendly and discreet, while I enjoyed some of the best breakfast I've had in any hotel. The cleanliness of the rooms is honestly unbeatable. The aesthetics of the buildings and the breathtaking location made me feel that I got myself lost somewhere in paradise for the duration of my stay. I can only feel grateful for such an opportunity. If I could give 6 stars to this hotel I would have definitely done so.",0
You can feel the difference the moment you stepped in Pezoules. Everything is spot on. Staffs are extremely helpful and I think it is one of the most memorable thing about staying in Pezoules. They made some really good recommendations during our stay and helped us to make reservations. Room is not exactly very spacious but very comfortable to stay in. The balcony is top notch. You feel relaxed and can stay there for the whole afternoon with the amazing view and not get bored.Breakfast is served at our own balcony. Choices are plentiful and quality is fair enough. The only thing to note is the difficult stair to reach Penzoles. But I guess that is what you need to bear for the amazingly view in Santorini. I would highly recommend Pezoules to everyone I know.   Room Tip: Our room is Ligaria which is great. But any rooms are. See more room tips,2
"Pezoules is second to none as far as hotels go. The staff were ever so friendly & hospitable. Breakfast was devine, not to mention the views of the Caldera from the jacuzzi! We stayed 2 nights for our wedding/honeymoon & would stay at Pezoules again without a doubt. The Lavenda cave house was so private & the pictures tell the REAL story. Thank you to ALL the wonderful staff for making our stay so wonderful & creating memories that will last a lifetime. Kimberley & Matthew (from Australia)",3
"The view from Pezoules is breathtaking, the infinity pool is awesome and the hotel host and the staff are so welcoming. The location of Pezoules is superior not just because of the view, but since the hotel jets out further in the hill location, there are no other hotels blocking, obstructing or making your feel to closely surrounded. Yet as you sit on your patio you can look back into the hill and along side of you to see the white washed beauty of all the buildings in Oia. The traditional cave house design of our room adds to the expected Greek experience. The breakfast served on our balcony every morning was delicious and substantial. Thank you Dimitri and your whole team, we have a memory of a lifetime! Hope to return someday and stay with you again!",1
"There's no place like it!We stayed in Pezoules for our honeymoon. We stayed in Oia for 6 nights and since we weren't sure how Pezoules will be, we booked only 3 nights in advance. We got absolutely ""addicted"": best service, best facilities, best breakfast, best view of the caldera, peace and quiet ;) so we stayed there 3 more nights. They offer 7 rooms, different facilities but most have outdoor jacuzzi. We walked quite a lot in Oia and the surrounding villages and we can say with certainty that if you look for privacy, beauty, top service and great staff- Pezoules is the place to be. Even though it was end of season, the owner was kind enough to let us stay (we stayed after he suppose to close the place for winter) and we enjoyed even in the rainy days, using the outdoor jacuzzi with the caldera view. We defiantly would like to come back and recommend Pezoules to you all ;)",0
"We stayed at Pezoules for two nights. Oh, how I wish we could have stayed longer! This place is magical. The view of the caldera is unbelievable - exactly what is advertised. Every picture could be a postcard. And the service is impeccable. We stayed in the Louisa cave house, which is comfortable, specious and clean. Breakfast is delivered each morning to the room - you can eat on the terrace or in the room. We do think that a hotel of this caliber should charge extra for a homemade egg - a small (not sure what kind) of hard boiled egg comes on the breakfast tray - but otherwise, the breakfast is truly lovely.The service here cannot be surpassed. All staff treated us like special guests: Valentino, who carried our luggage up and down those steep steps and delivered our morning breakfast tray; Hercules, who made great drinks at the bar with a smile and comfortable conversation. and who remembered our names after our first meeting; Ioli, who offered restaurant suggestions and gave excellent advice on how and where to see Santorini's famous sunsets; and owner Dimitri, who demonstrated his desire for every guest to feel special.We will always remember our stay at Pezoules as something special!",0
"My review is a bit overdue, as I stayed five nights at Pezoules a year ago now (last October). However, I could not let the opportunity pass to write a review. This property is second to none. I have traveled extensively and Pezoules stands-out in my mind as truly my most relaxing stay... ever... anywhere. There is a magical quality to this lovely property. It is very special, impeccably maintained, absolutely gorgeous, and spotlessly clean. The service is attentive, while not being intrusive. The views are spectacularly breathtaking. Pezoules is very centrally located in one of the best parts of Oia, with plenty to do and see in close walking distance. I stayed in the Levanta Cave House, which is furthest down the cliff and most private. I loved it - simply loved it! One word of caution, there are a lot of stairs to reach this property, but every step is worth it! Pezoules is second to none! An amazing and incredibly special place. I definitely plan to return and would stay nowhere else on Santorini. Many thanks to the Pezoules team for a wonderful stay!   Room Tip: Levanta is very private and absolutely lovely. See more room tips",0
"My wife and I just returned from an absolutely wonderful stay at Pezoules. The views from our room out to the Caledera/Harbor were spectacular. We opted for the room on the lowest level which gave us total privacy - but beware, 100 sometimes steep steps from the Oia walkway down to the room. The quality of the accommodations and the breakfast were top notch. Even in mid-October, we used both the infinity pool and the outdoor jacuzzi. Finally, the entire staff, as well as the owner who was onsite and hands on - couldn't have been more helpful and thoughtful. Pezoules easily earned 5 stars from us.",0
"Due to the popular demand of peak season, we were only at Pezoules for one night but it was absolutely mesmerizing! The spanning panoramic view of the ocean and islands from the hotel was utterly breathtaking. The staff were so helpful and attentive - special compliments to Valentino the hercules who helped us with our ridiculous sized luggage at ease up and down the steep Santorini stairs to and from the parking lot - and carried our massive tray of breakfast! Such a dedicated and hard worker in hospitality is rarely seen.The room was very clean and well kept, and it felt so homely. The view from the room was worth a million dollars and I couldn't have had a more relaxing afternoon lazing on the balcony/room. The hotel was also very close to the main strip of santorini, and despite its highly convenient location, it was away from the noisy hustle and bustle and we slept comfortably that night.The breakfast and food at the hotel was of a decent variety and tasted great, and the drinks were like droplets from a heavenly oasis on a scorching summer day. I'll let the pictures do the rest of my compliments for this hotel, but I'd like to thank the establishment for a wonderful (despite brief) stay and we would absolutely return if we are back in Santorini.",0
"My wife and I staid at Pezoules for our honeymoon and can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay. The rooms were excellent, the view superb and the staff incredibly accommodating and attentive to our needs. The recommendations they made for us (from dinner reservations to daily activities) were spot on and helped to make our time in Santorini truly unforgettable! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Santorini.",0
We stayed at this lovely small hotel at the end of June 2015 for 3 nights. We had the Valeriana room which was a spacious room with a shared large balcony with the best view imaginable of the Caldera. The breakfasts which were served on your balcony were delicious. The staff were all very helpful booking us reservations at some great restaurants- Roka- causal but very good and Feredini- more formal and very romantic. Our only complaint was the shared taxi from the ferry. Both coming and going we had trouble. When we arrived we had to wait over a half an hour for the slow ferry to arrive and returning to the airport no taxi came and we were put on a bus with 30 other people.,1
"We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. My husband had a knee injury and they got him a knee brace, ice. And a foot stool and checked on him all day. The food was all fresh, home made rolls and bread, all served on our own terrace. They fixed us dinner under the stars for our anniversary. Our cave room was lovely and unique, the view breathtaking. The staff are available 24/7. We will miss our Pezoules family and hope to return. Please go, you will not be sorry. We had the Alathea room with a hot tub, but they all look lovely!",0
"Traveling to Santorini was an amazing experience, many thanks to the amazing staff & accommodations at Pezoules. Traditional & genuine Greek hospitality is truly represented at this hotel, further enhancing our vacation. Located in the heart of Oia, Pezoules offers breathtaking views, picturesque rooms, as well as delicious & authentic Greek food (prepared by the family owners), for a truly unforgettable experience. The staff even carried our suitcases from the main road down the steps to the hotel, which was a very nice touch. This family-owned hotel embodies Greek culture at its finest, you will not regret staying here!",0
"Pezoules gives us helpful information in advance and double check the meet point. Staff was too amazing for us to take our luggages down to our room, the lowest place, where no one will bother us. Staff also introduced the well place to observe sunset, instead of the famous place, and actively booked the restaurant for us, which is not on our schedule, but we liked the food very much. The jacuzzi outside was warm all day, and very suitable for the cool day in Oct at night and in the morning( to see the sunrise). The pool was amazing and very beautiful with surrounding lots of blue and white houses. We can eat breakfast in front of our room without noise. I think I can not enjoy the quiet if I lived near the main street. The staff is sweat heart and perceptive, and we both have most fantastic experience in our life there.",1
"A fabulous place. With even better staff. Stunning views of the Caldera with smashing rooms. Not just a friendly place, we were looked after as if we were genuine friends. One evening we were discussing a local fava bean dish with the owner's wife. The next day a fabulous version was sent to our room with her compliments. It's the little things that make a Pezoules such a special destination.",1
"We spent a lot of effort looking for a hotel for our 4-day adventure to Santorini and our hard work paid off: Pezoules was the perfect hotel for us. Situated in the center of Oia, ground zero for shopping, dining and strolling, Pezoules is discreetly tucked away just steps (yes, there are LOTS of steps everywhere in Oia) from this tourist thoroughfare. Pezoules is where you want to be to feel close to the energy of the town, yet the hotel is so completely private that we felt miles away from all of that the minute we passed through the hotel's entrance. Built just three years ago (read: fresh paint, upholstery, furnishings and lovely linens), there are only 7 rooms in this family owned and operated hotel. Our room was spacious and modern yet totally in keeping with the indigenous architectural style of the Island. With an airy room, modern and well appointed bathroom and enormous terrace overlooking the famed Caldera, Pezoules was the embodiment of low-key elegance. Mornings began with a delicious breakfast delivered to our private terrace. We then headed out to explore Oia (it is a tourist mecca, so we dodged the crowds arriving from cruise ships and tour buses) before realizing that the nicest, most delicious lunch could be had back on our own terrace, at our own private retreat. A swim in the pool, a drink in hand, and we found ourselves attached to the chaises, admiring the panoramic view of the Aegean and the Caldera. From Pezoules' perfect location we watched the sunny mountainside fall into shadows and the twinkling lights of Oia come to life. The breeze on the patio was divine. The owners of Pezoules have created an oasis of calmness and understated elegance. The staff is small and personable and from front office to housekeeping, every employee had a part in making our stay seem like we were visiting a friend's home. Nothing was too much to ask and everything was done in a way that seemed effortless and personal. There arent enough words of praise for this little gem of a hotel. We'll certainly be return visitors!",1
"One of (if not the) best place I have ever stayed. We stayed in the Athaea Cave House and our favorite aspect was the private terrace which looked over the caldera. It had its own large hot tub, chairs umbrellas, table (where we had lots of our meals) & sunbathed. We travelled all over the island but almost never beat the view we had from that private patio. I am very picky when it comes to travel, hotels, food, etc. and I cannot pick one thing to complain about but instead feel compelled to praise Dimitri and his team. They were so attentive (without being too attentive like many upscale hotels) and provided just the right amount of service. The infinity pool was awesome. The food was incredible, and the breakfast each morning was something we looked forward to each time we woke up. I could not have asked for a better way to spend our honeymoon than at Pezoules. Just incredible. I will recommend staying there to you and everyone else i talk to as they far exceeded my wildest expectations. I have never written a trip advisors review before but was so blown away that I felt compelled to do so, so that more people go and enjoy Pezoules and its wonderful amenities.   Room Tip: Athaea Cave house was so awesome and had its own private terrace and hot tub, some of the other room... See more room tips",0
"Staying at Santorini for our honeymoon has always been my wife's dream, and I am happy that Pezoules delivered on her high expectations. We were glad that we got the transfer from the airport as the hotel could be a bit hard to find if Valentino wasn't there to welcome us at the Oia parking lot and carry our luggage. Once we arrived, we were greeted with a flawlessly maintained property with magnificent views, privacy from the crazy crowds, charming cave-like rooms, and friendly polite staff. The best features of our Mentha Cave house was the private Jacuzzi which enjoyed frequently along with waking up to a rich breakfast with unobstructed views of the sea. Words can't really do it justice so just look at the photos. Thank you Pezoules for a dream come true, we shall return and see you again!",0
"Amazingly beautiful place with a touch of fairyland,Oia!Far the best hotel of our trip,super cozy,clean,perfect t views to the caldera and waters,absolutely breath taking...I have spend a week with my family in Pezoules and dream to come back.A lot of hotels provide great service but the people at this property seemed so sincere about it,we all just loved it!!! Loved it!!!We recommend this accommodation and hope to get back!",0
"My husband and I just got back from two weeks in Greece, and the best part of our trip was our stay in this hotel.The location is perfect. Close to restaurants and shops, but far enough down the steps that you feel like you're on your own private part of the island. I did not mind the steps at all, though I would discourage very high heels.The cave rooms (we stayed in the Mentha) are adorably decorated all with stunning views. While we filled our time on Santorini with memorable outings (hiking, wine tastings, cooking classes, and sailing) I wish we had spent more time relaxing by the beautiful pool and enjoying the breathtaking views from our balcony.The breakfast is absolutely perfect and scrumptious.The staff is definitely part of what makes this place so wonderful. Everyone is friendly, accommodating and full of suggestions for the city of Oia. In particular, we have Hercules to thank for the amazing photographs he took of my husband and I (thank you!!!), suggestions for food and drink and general congeniality! And to Ioli for everything else (not to mention her beautiful artwork)!I would highly suggest having a private dinner prepared by Mirella and served on your balcony. This was easily one of the most delicious, romantic and memorable meals I can remember in my life. The staff did a lovely job of prepping our table with a white tablecloth, flower and candle. With the backdrop of the sunset colors and a bottle of local white wine, it was heaven.I cannot WAIT to go back",1
"We just completed a very enjoyable 4 night stay in Oia, Santorini at Pezoules. this small, boutique hotel has an excellent location in the heart of Oia and an exceptional, unobstructed view of the Caldera and Aegean Sea below. Beautiful property, well maintained, with excellent staff......very courteous, responsive, and friendly. Family run, so the service is personal, and the owner is directly involved in the operation of this delightful resort. Very little to improve upon.....softer towels, better lighting in the shower, and perhaps pads for the chaise lounges are the only things we can think of that could be improved, all of which were overshadowed by the more important, positive attributes above.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Zorzis Hotel for 10 nights during July this year - we were so happy with our choice. The hotel looks lovely from the outside and is equally as lovely inside. Both the hotel and the pool area are spotlessly clean and so well looked after. Hiroco, Spiros and Maria do an amazing job keeping the hotel looking so well and always seem to be working. Santorini was lovely and should we return in the future we would definitely stay at Hotel Zorzis again. Hiroco and Spiros made us feel so welcome and are a lovely couple. We felt very at home and were not ready to leave after the 10 nights! The whole hotel smells so clean and the rooms are immaculate. I have never noticed another hotel take such care over cleanliness, the pool area and sunloungers were cleaned on a daily basis. We could not fault the hotel and will definitely be recommending it to family and friends. Thank you Hiroco and Spiros for a wonderful stay.",0
We stayed 4 nights to Hiroko and Spiro's place. It has been a great pleasure to meet this couple who has been very welcoming and nice. They give you many advices on what to do. Great swimming pool in the garden and they care about property. 5min walk to the rock beach and 15min walk to the closed supermarket. We recommend you to rent a car. They have a single but good breakfast each morning.,0
"My partner and I stayed in Santorini for a friends wedding and were initially struck with how expensive the hotels on the island were. We had done a couple of trips earlier in the year so were looking for a more reasonably priced place. With this in mind my partner came across Zorzis and we booked in for a week. The couple that run the hotel do a fantastic job. They work super hard to make sure all aspects of the hotel are as good as they can be. Each room has its own wifi meaning the signal and speed are as quick as I have ever experienced. The rooms are clean and have all the mod cons including a high end air conditioning unit, fridge (for the endless waters that you need in the Santorini heat!), wardrobe with plenty of hangers (not often found in hotels) and a very comfy bed. I believe each room as a lovely outside space which either faces the pool area or their beautiful gardens that they work so hard to ensure are fabulously colourful. There are only 10 rooms so the hotel and in particular the pool is extremely quiet. Breakfast is a greek style affair with greek yogurt, fruit, pastries, cake, bread and juice. The hotel is located about 50 metres from the beach where all the Perissa activities are. There are a few hotels down there but no doubt you pay a significant premium to save yourself a 50 metre walk.I cannot speak highly enough for the professionalism, service and warm welcome we received at Zorzis. We had a fantastic week and couldn't have been looked after any better. I would stay again and again and again.",3
"After just a couple of hours at Zorzis hotel I realized why they have so many 5* reviews. Clean and cozy hotel, with owners very friendly and welcoming. Amazing breakfast with fresh fruit and Greek yoghurt every morning. If you are looking for a clean and comfortable hotel in Perissa Zorzis is the right place.",1
"The hotel is small but really nice, it has a beautiful garden, private swimming pool and it is only 3 minutes walking to the black beach of Perissa. Spiros and Hiroko are wonderful hosts, kind and always helpful. In our opinion, Breakfast could be improved and should offer a wider range of food and beverages. Anyway, we highly recommend this place if you are staying in Perissa!",1
"The title of this review speaks volumes, this is our second stay at this gem of a hotel, and we really did struggle to leave on our final day. The hotel is immaculately maintained, tranquil and spotlessly clean, and is very conveniently positioned, within a short distance to the beach and amenities, but without being too close. The hosts (the fabulous Spiros and wonderful Hiroko) raise the bar even higher, we were made to feel welcome from the minute we arrived, until the minute we left. Both Spiros and Hiroko made sure we were very well looked after, so that we could relax and enjoy our holiday at ease. The only disappointment we have, is that we have to wait another year before we can return!!!!!",2
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Zorzis, Spiros and Hiroko are wonderful hosts and their hotel is a real credit to them. The hotel is spotlessly clean, furnished to a very high standard and the gardens and pool area is maintained again to a very high standard. If I visit Santorini again I would not think of staying anywhere else - totally loved the peaceful, relaxing ambience. Perissa is a fairly small village and everything is close at hand, bars, restaurants and beach.",1
"Our 4th trip to Santorini since 2013, our 4th stay at The Zorzis hotel, we wouldn't stay anywhere else, even after a couple of years ago, spending 3 nights in Imerovigli, our first choice is always Zorzis.The hotel is beautifully clean and always smells really lovely, Maria, the cleaner works very hard.Breakfast is lovely and fresh and is served from 08.30-10amWe love the pool at the back of the hotel, again always extremely clean and quiet.This hotel is adult only and only has 10 rooms. Wifi is very fast is your room and also around the pool.The owners, Spiros & Hiroko will do everything they can to ensure that you have everything you want to have a wonderful relaxing holiday. They offer recommendations on restaurants, tours and anything else you may need.This year we did a sunset cruise, which Spiros booked for us. He also booked us a table at Metaxi Mas restaurant, both excellent recommendations.We are very sad that we wont be returning to Santorini next year, but definitely will be back in the very near future.I totally recommend this lovely little hotel in Perissa, so much so that a friend of mine is going next year with her friends for their silver wedding anniversary.Thank you once again Spiros & Hiroko and of course Maria.Val & Adrian",2
"What an incredible stay in the beautiful Zorzis Hotel. We were very sad to say goodbye today to the owners of Zorzis and our new friends Spiros and Hiroko. Both such warm and generous hosts, they genuinely care about their guests and give excellent service. Our flight arrived at 3am to Santorini, luckily though Spiros had already emailed me to ask arrival time and was able to provide a taxi to collect us. Our flight was delayed, but even at 4am Spiros was there to warmly greet us and take us to our room. There was no fuss about check in due to the late hr, instead we were led to our room with a large bottle of complimentary water (you can't drink tap water in santorini) and shown the amenities of the room. The room was spacious, the bed huge and comfortable , lovely bathroom with stone floor shower. Just like having a reflexology massage whilst you showered! We also had a gorgeous balcony with a great view of the pool. There was the much appreciated aircon and fan and safe for valuables. Wifi access was excellent and fast as new Fibre optic cables have recently been added to the area. Well rested we made sure to get up for breakfast, included in the cost of accomadation. It was a lovely Greek style feast of fresh fruit, yummy thick Greek yoghurt, bread, cheese, honey, jam, juice, cake and savoury pastries. And for the coffee lovers some excellent drip coffee. Breakfast is served by Spiros' wife Hiroko. A lovely lady, she happily gave us tips on things to do and see on the island. Being our 3rd visit we were really pleased with the excellent tips on sightseeing and restaurants, even where to hire an ATV/ quad bike. (Mikes) Every day Spiros and Hiroko asked about our plans, how we were etc, ensuring we were happy. we had lovely chats with them both, relaxing on the front terrace enjoying complimentary white wine. This is a small 10 room boutique hotel with excellent personalised service. The pool out back is clean, lovely, spacious and there are always plenty of sun beds. Spiros will also happily provide sun umbrellas if needed. The gardens are lovely and beautifully looked after by Hiroko with lots of pretty flowers, even a fig tree out back, figs which are served with breakfast. The hotel is centrally located on the main rd of perissa but was still very quiet. There is a bus stop a short walk away and perissa beach is only a few hundred meters away. Restaurants, bars and shops are all only metres away. Do yourself a favour and you won't regret the excellent real hospitality of this lovely couple! We can't wait to go back. Ps did I mention the gift of a bottle of wine we received on check out to enjoy on the next leg of our holiday? So very sweet and generous! A holiday to remember!",1
"We visited Santorini two years ago and walked past this beautiful Boutique Hotel. The gardens where so colourful and immaculate it was apparent a lot of time and effort had been spent making them so beautiful. We read reviews and deiced to book a vacation there. I can honestly say this we were not disappointed. This hotel is a gem. Immaculate throughout both inside and outside. The hosts Spiros and Hiroko made our stay welcoming and thanks to Maria for keeping our room so spotless. Hiroko picked fresh figs from a tree and invited us to try as we relaxes around the pool. Spiros waited up at night and invited us to join him for a glass of wine. We have booked again, next year cannot come quick enough. Thank you Spiros and Hiroko.",1
"Have travelled to many places all over the world but this hotel beats them all hands down. The decor is immaculate, clean linens and towels daily, quiet clean pretty pool area and the most wonderful hosts Sprios and Hiroko who couldn't be more helpful.Situated in the centre of Perissa with easy access to bars restaurants and the beach within easy walking distance, the local busses stop just next door which go to Thira regularly.Breakfast is served by Hiroko and Maria in a light beautifully appointed room or outside on the terrace( providing it's not to windy!) consisting of yoghurt, fresh pastries, bread,jams, honey, fresh fruit, juices and tea/coffee which sets you up for the day ahead.This is a very special place and will be visiting here for many years to come. THANKYOU Spiros and Hiroko for another fabulous stay and miss you both ( and the cats!) Look forward to seeing you next year.K & A.x",1
"I have made it a point never to visit the same place twice, until I stayed at Zorzis last year. It is no wonder they have so many repeat guests, myself now being one of them, as Spiros and Hiroko have created something very special in this gorgeous boutique hotel. The situation is great, close to the beach, and lots of bars and restaurants. The hotel sparkles with cleanliness, and is very tastefully decorated. I loved breakfast, clean towels every day, beautiful pool and garden, in fact everything about Zorzis . I cannot recommend highly enough.   Room Tip: Balcony rooms are lovely See more room tips",3
"First time in Santorini, what a fabulous place and a beautiful hotel. My friend stayed here 3 years ago and had said what a gorgeous place it was but it was more than I expected. Spiros and Hiroko are the perfect hosts and such lovely people. Avaible to help and advise on places to go etc. The hotel is spotlessly clean which is high up on my list of musts. Beautiful pool area which again is very well kept.About a 5 minute walk from the beach front where there are many bars and restaurants (more than I was expecting). There are also places to eat and drink near the hotel, dorians for cocktails is a must and grandma's kitchen for a gyros OWe hired a quad of for the week which is a great way to see the island and would recommend this. I will definitely be returning to Santorini and will certainly be staying at Zorzis. Thank you for a wonderful week",3
Me and my wife returned to santorini hoping no one else new about it and was still unspoilt. No need to worry it was still amazing. we went in the last week in June and it was just right hot enough to soak up the sun and could get into the many and mostly excellent restaurants. we stayed at the zorzis 3 years ago and was never going anywhere else . Smaller rooms than we would normally go for but spotlessly clean the pool earia has got plenty of beds and spiross was always there to get you a brolly for some shade. What a gentleman always there to help or have a conversation about the world you couldn't get in at night without having at least a glass or three of wine from thre local winerie or he would often just leave a bottle in the room . As for hiroko his lovely wife who as well as serving breakfast of tea fruit yoghurt pastries and beautiful bread was always around to help whilst finding time to prune the amazing flowers surrounding the hotel . All in all a perfect location a 5 minute stroll to the bars and restaurants at the beach front or over the road from several bars and restaurant especially dorians a great place always buzzing . Santorini still unspoilt and zorzis still the best   Room Tip: Upper rooms are bigger See more room tips,1
"We found this hotel trough TripAdvisor rated as no.1 in Perissa and we weren't disappointed. We were greeted on arrival by the owners Hiroko and Spiros, a lovely touch. And it just got better from there.The hotel is only 10 rooms and is immaculately kept. Such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. It has a private pool, bars and restaurants within easy walking distance and the beech is only 300m away. But what makes the place are the owners. Always on hand for a chat and advice about where to go and how to get there or even a chat over a glass of wine in the evening.If you want a quiet and relaxing place to stay within easy reach of all amenities and the rest of the island I would totally recommend. We will be returning.",2
"This is our 12th time to Santorini and our 6th time to Zorzis.From the moment you arrive till the moment you leave nothing is too much for hiroko and spires.Attention to detail and the comfort of all those that stay is top of their priorities.Cleanliness and a amazing relaxed atmosphere, the gardens are lovingly attended to by the lady of the manor.And Maria in attendance to ensure your rooms etc are spotless, our home away from home.",1
"been to spiros & hiroko before,seem to improve year on year,easy going & chatty owners,always clean/well maintained to a very high standard,would recommend this hotel to anyone,very good value for money,best in the area,beautiful gardens & peaceful around the pool,we will be back.   Room Tip: been in several rooms all very nice. See more room tips",2
"Recently returned from another stay at the beautiful Hotel Zorsis. We thought this small friendly hotel was perfect after our first visit but upon our return found that Spiros and Hiroko have been working hard with yet more improvements, new doors and windows etc.The hotel is immaculate, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated in the traditional colours of Santorini. The pool area and surrounding gardens are also beautifully kept. Hiroko spends much time attending to the stunning gardens, full of colourful flowers, one of the many reasons Hotel Zorsis stands out from others.The location is excellent close to shops, bars, restaurants, bakery and just a short walk to the beach. Spiros and Hiroko have managed a perfect balance of being excellent hosts. They are always there to help and really can’t do enough to ensure you have the perfect stay but at the same they are not at all invasive, leaving you to relax in the calming atmosphere of their small friendly hotel.We try hard to always visit and stay at new places but this is one hotel we hope we will be lucky enough to return to yet again in the future.",3
"Just returned from having a week staying at Zorzis Hotel. I could not fault a thing even if I tried. The host were so welcoming and thoughtful. The grounds were immaculate. The pool was immaculate Spiros was always cleaning it and cleaning the filters etc. Hiro was always gardening..the grounds were beautiful. The hotel was spotless, the beds were comfy , the breakfast was good & the host lovely. All you could want in a hotel. We got a little briefing about the island and places to go. They have a ferry timetable so you know when the likes of Fira & Oia won't be packed with thousands of ferry tourists. This made our stay. Going to these places with ferrys in I think would of ruined it. Also had bus time table and shown where to catch it. (minutes down the road) when we went to Oia we used a recommended transfer by the host. It was excellent and great value compared to the taxis. So again they helped when we had days out with recommendations. Spiros told us of the wine tasting in santorini wines. Tuesday and Friday live music. We went was amazing and a great spot to watch the sunset..also reasonable prices. Our rooms were always made up and lovely and clean to return to each day..breakfast was lovely and filling. A great start to the day. Spiros would make any reservations or transfer bookings we needed ..both so helpful and welcoming. Great at what they do..they are truly lovely people and welcome you to thier lovely hotel. The location is also spot on. Was slightly confused where to stay in santorini when doing research before booking. Having stayed in Perrissa I think it's ideal. A beach on your door step a lovely pool at Zorzis, great transfers into other villages or popular sights. Found the local bars and restaurants were more reasonable then Fira & Oia. Got most things you need walking distance. Loved Perissa and loved Zorzis would 110% recommend staying here. Beautiful hotel and really lovely host. Do book it you won't regret it. We had an amazing holiday sure you will too!",4
"We have just spent another wonderful week with spiros and Hiroko . This was our 2nd visit with them at their beautiful hotel.The hospitality and genuine friendliness goes beyond anything we have experienced before. Nothing is too much trouble . The hotel is ideally situated close to the beach, restaurants, bus stop, supermarket and a 24 hour bakery .The hotel is immaculate , gardens so beautiful .The pool absolutely gorgeous . We stayed one night in Fira and came back to Zorzis and it felt like we was back at Home! We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! We are planning another visit with them for next year .Christine and David",3
Zorzis never fails to deliver a truly great holiday experience. Spiros and Hiroko are best hosts we have met in all our years traveling. They offer a warm welcome and are on hand if ever you need anything but not intrusive purely lovely and friendly.Spiros works hard in the winter months adding new features to make their guests stay forever the more comfortable. Hiroko works extremely hard taking care of guests with just Maria to help and her down time is tending to the beautiful gardens.Rooms are beautifully Greek in keeping with the landscape with ensuite in each room and air con plus ceiling fan.Each room now has speedy individual WiFi connection and beautiful balcony.A quiet location minutes from bars restaurants and the beach.We had a lovely relaxing stay and hope to visit again soon,2
"As others mention, Sprio and Heroko make this place happen. She provides menus, insight and tour choices. He is there to help you get your stuff to your room and move around the cars so that you have a place to park. They provide a healthy Greek breakfast to start off your day. The hotel is on the main street only a short walk to the beach. There are restaurants across the street, down the block etc. We walked to the beach and ate at several beach front tavernas when we visited.The rooms have individually controlled thermostats, a plus for us. There was no smoking also a plus for us.The rooms have outlets for your electronics and sufficient light to see.But most importantly Spiros and Heroko are there to make your staff special and they do...It felt like we were family. I could go on and on...Only downside - the shower is a closed off corner of the restroom with curtain walls with out a hook to hang up the shower handle. Some folks might have to learn how to shower this way. Don't let it stop you from coming.One last thing, it was very reassuring to come back to at the end of each day of touring or visiting. It really felt like a place to unwind with people who cared about you and your visit. I met a guest who was planning to stay for two weeks, he comes to unwind and relax. This is definitely the place to do it!!   Room Tip: Our room was great. Upstairs on the second floor with a small balcony. See more room tips",1
lovely and reasonable hotel run by a charming couple spiros and heroko for whom nothing is too much trouble and who make one feel relaxed and at home.hotel is spotlessly clean and surrounded together with pool by flowers against a bondesque backdrop of santorinis highest mountain with a monastery hanging from the top!All this with 80 megabyte net access if you really need to contact the outside world!   Room Tip: rear near pool top floor rooms are best See more room tips,1
"Wow! A Honeymoon to remember. Having booked the hotel after reading the rave reviews, my Husband and I were dubious it would live up to the hype. To say it exceeded our expectations is an understatement. We have been lucky enough to stay in hotels across the world, and trust me when I say, this is one experience that will not disappoint. Firstly, the hotel is immaculate. Immaculate. The rooms, pool, breakfast room are all spotless (will continue to be during your stay) and the flowers surrounding the hotel, so carefully tended to every day, are truly beautiful! It's in close proximity to the beach, shops, bars and restaurants and ideally located to explore the island by car or bus. Okay....now on to the hosts, Spiros and Hiroko. I'm not sure I can remember ever staying anywhere where I felt such genuine affection for the proprietors! They really are 'the cherry on top'. Top class customer service. Both Spiros and Hiroko have superb knowledge of the island and nothing is too much trouble. If you're looking to book a hotel in Perissa or indeed Santorini, look no further. In my opinion, Zorzis Hotel really is the 'jewel in the crown'. Exceptional.",2
"We recently stayed in early May and had a fantastic time. We chose the place because of the great reviews here, and hotel Zorzis exceeded our expectations. The owner’s Spiros and Hiroko are incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive. Their local expert knowledge was invaluable to help us plan our activities. The location is a short walk to the beach and the bus stop is just outside which connects to all the main tourist destinations. Hopefully we will visit again sometime!<U+6BCE><U+6669><U+306E><U+304A><U+558B><U+308A><U+3082><U+672C><U+5F53><U+306B><U+697D><U+3057><U+304B><U+3063><U+305F><U+3067><U+3059><U+3002><U+307E><U+305F><U+3044><U+3064><U+304B><U+304A><U+4F1A><U+3044><U+3057><U+307E><U+3057><U+3087><U+3046>!",1
"Just got back from this charming hotel, I booked this holiday purely based on the comments on trip adviser and it really did not disappoint. As others have said nothing is to much trouble for the lovely hosts Spiros and Hiroko they really do look after you from the moment you arrive until you leave. Everything is so clean and comfortable, lovely comfy bed, air conditioning and so many thoughtful touches eg beach/pool towels, kettle in your room, slippers, fridge and safe. Wonderful views from our room of the mountain, lovely breakfast every morning always served with a smile by Hiroko with advice on where to visit in Santorini and weather updates. We hired a car from the airport but to be honest you don't really need one there is a local bus service and cars can be hired locally. The pool area and flowers are stunning, so peaceful and relaxing. You are a stones throw away from bars and restaurants all of which offer good quality food. We went all over the island and I can honestly say we definitely picked the right area and hotel to stay in. We loved our holiday and will definitely return to this charming hotel and will recommend to our family and friends.",1
We booked the hotel direct with Spiros as a get away after a tough year; we wanted some rest and relaxation and boy do you get it here in the bucket loadLocated in Perissa it's easy to find and an oasis of calm. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the attention to making your stay relaxing is amazing; all rooms have a local wifi extender meaning excellent continuous access to wifi even by the pool; as well as crisp clean linen and they even supply beach towels! Our hosts Spiros and Hiroko are obsessional about detail from the immaculate breakfast provided by Hiroko of fresh fruit and geek yoghurt as well as pasties and fresh bread; to Spiros' happy welcoming style 24/7 when you arrive back after your days and evenings out; and nothing is too much trouble eg a wine glass to sip santorini wine by the pool!. Hiroko looks to see when cruise ships are coming in to make sure your time in Oia /Fira isn't spoiled by too many tourists and their local knowledge of where to go and what to do is essential to planning your weekThe pool area is delightful on a hot Greek day; private and comfortable with lovely loungers and beautiful planting (Hiroko!) means chilling out is all part of their planQuite rightly this hotel is no1 on trip advisorA haven of peace and calm and devil to the detail Certainly the best booking you will make; I'm sorry we only have 4 more days to stay in this gorgeous hotel!,1
"Trust me when I tell you that I’ve stayed in more Greek rooms that you’ve had hot dinners. Before I retired I used to inspect and report on tourist accommodation all over the Greek islands. So when I tell you that it just doesn’t get any better than Zorzis, you can believe it. The secret to the ambience and charm of this little boutique hotel, is pride of ownership. Spiros and Hiroko have created a little oasis of comfort on the scenic island of Santorini. This is an unusual pairing, that has combined Spiros who personifies the Greece of yesteryear, with Japanese obsession to detail that is the ever smiling Hiroko.At the start of every season the whole building is freshly painted white. The garden is repaired from the ravages of winter under the expert ministrations of diminutive Hiroko. Broken flower pots are combined with succulents and pieces of gnarled olive wood and vine trimmings, to produce unexpected little architectural touches amongst the brilliant flowers. We’ve actually observed Hiroko gardening using nail scissers for precision work. And when she wanted to create a little stream with Koi Carp Japanese style, she was faced with the reality of the dry heat of a Santorini summer and the scarcity of water. Result? A ‘stream’ in the garden consisting of little stones, overlaid with carefully selected bigger stones. On these with the sure hand of the artist that she is, Hiroko has hand painted lifelike Koi, complete with shadows. As you walk past on your way to the pristine swimming pool, the illusion of a swimming shoal of fish in a stream is complete.This kind of attention to detail is evident all over this little hotel. The beds are large and comfortable with crisp white linen. The rooms have air conditioning and hot water systems that just works. Repeating modems are strategically placed, so that 10 M/b of fibre optic broadband is available not just in every room, but around the pool as well. There is a bus stop almost outside the door. Ask the time of a bus to Thira, the most photographed town in Greece and Hiroko will not only supply that information, but also the docking times of expected cruise ships, so that your visit to the island capital is not spoilt by hordes of tourists milling around.Opposite the bus stop is Dorian's Bar which is open from morning ‘proper’ coffee to very late cocktails and plays the soft music of yesteryear. The beach and tavernas are a five minute walk; but few people prefer a sunbed on the beach compared to a sunbed around the tranquil pool at Zorzis.This is not a rock-n-roll holiday and there is a no children policy. It is a truly peaceful and relaxed sojourn in the sun at a very reasonable price. This was a hard review to pen. For while I wish Hiroko and Spiros every commercial success, I really don’t want too many people discovering ‘my’ Greek secret escape. It really is that good.",5
"First time here but suspect we'll be back. Wonderful hotel, lovely room and spotless. Spiros and Hiroko made us most welcome and provided lots of information on places to visit. They arranged transport for us and booked restaurants. Pool area is quiet and relaxing. Lovely breakfast each morning set us up for the day. Plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars near by. Bus stop to Fira a few steps away. Old town of Emporio worth a visit.",4
"We saw great reviews of this boutique hotel in Perissa & they were all TRUE! :D Greece was the last leg of our honeymoon and we had a great time meeting Hiroko and Spiros. Location of the hotel was along the main road.We didn't have a hard time riding the public bus cos the bus stop was only a stone throw away from the hotel. We'd ride the bus to go to Fira or Oia.The hotel & rooms were pristine clean. No wonder they have all the accolades from Tripadvisor, for years and years!!! There are also dining places and convenience stores just within the area so it's easy to get food if you're hungry.We'd definitely stay here again if ever we visit Greece on our anniversary!   Room Tip: The one facing the mountain vs the road See more room tips",3
We really enjoyed our time at Hotel Zorzis. Hiroko made us a lovely breakfast everyday and gave us some great trips about things to do and see in the area. The hotel was very beautiful and an easy walk to the beach. The bus stop was a one minute walk so easy to get around the rest of the island from there. I would very much recommend this hotel.,2
"After a 3 night stay at Zorzis my friend and I could find only two faults. 1) Location (only a relative fault if you expect to be in the middle of the action- i.e. Fira or Oia) and 2) the shower head makes a mess in the bathroom. Honestly, aside from these two very small issues this hotel makes for a flawless stay. Hiroko and Spiros are incredibly welcoming and helpful with any question you might have. Hiroko serves a beautiful and delicious breakfast each morning. The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. The pool and grounds are absolutely gorgeous. Though Zorzis is not in the center of what seems to be the stereotypical Santorini action, it is literally in front of the bus to Fira/Firostefani/Imerovigli/Oia, is a 5 minute walk from Perissa beach, and it is also very easy to get to Kamari. All in all, Zorzis was one of the most wonderful hotel experiences I have had and our stay was a highlight of our trip to Greece.",1
"This has by far been the most welcoming hotel I've ever been to. The hotel is perfect for anyone who appreciates outstanding service, caring hosts and local recommendation for any activity on the island. They truly care about their guests and solutions are generally found before any problem could ever even come up. There has not been a single day that we haven't been overwhelmed by their kindness.The hotel itself is neatly furnitured and taken care of in that same loving way. Couldn't ask for more if traveling on a budget.Only downside: location. We stayed here in October and hadn't been aware that October would already be considered low season. Therefore, lots of restaurants around the area in perissa had already been closed. If you're looking for great accommodation right in Perissa, this is definitely the place to go, though!",4
"Just returned from a lovey holiday in Santorini, stayed at the Zorzis Hotel in Perissa one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in, perfect in every way, it's spotless, the rooms are cleaned every day, bedding and towels changed every day, you are also provided with towels for round the pool, it's so relaxing. Spiros and his wife Hiroko are the perfect hosts nothing is too much trouble, breakfast is lovely especially the mini homemade cheese pasties and cake. I would recommend this hotel to anyone it's a little gem and I would definitely return.",3
"Holiday was booked for us as Golden Wedding trip by son & partner ,who had been before .Spiros & Hiroko were so welcoming & couldn't do enough for us. Hotel was spotless, as was the pool area. Room 9 was very comfortable, with view to die for....Thoroughly enjoyable holiday. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: Rooms at the back (9, 10) are quieter, with views over pool & mountains See more room tips",1
"The hotel is just a 5 minute stroll to the beach and is near a couple of bars, a mini market and close to a bus stop - which was very handy. The hotel is clean, simple and secure and has a great pool. The rooms have TVs, a fridge, air-conditioning and free WIFI. But most of all, its the warm welcome and hospitality from Spiros and Hiroko that makes all the difference. They were very kind and helpful, gave advice on sightseeing, bus routes etc. and Spiros even phoned round the bus operators to help track down my missing camera! We'd highly recommend this hotel and if we come back to Santorini would definitely stay here again!",1
"Returned a couple of weeks ago from our fifth stay at Zorzis. Yet again, and just to reiterate what I’ve said in previous reviews, Spiros and Hiroko (not forgetting Maria!) work extremely hard in maintaining the high standards and beauty of this place. The comfort of their guests is of paramount importance and their attention to detail is second to none. Since spending our honeymoon here 5 years ago, Zorzis is, and very much remains a very special place for us, and we can’t imagine staying anywhere else and receiving the same warmth and hospitality as we do here. Like ourselves, many guests return, and therefore with only 10 rooms, booking in advance is recommended. Thank you Spiros and Hiroko for another lovely holiday and we hope to see you again soon.",1
"Our 2nd stay with Spiros and Hiroko, whose hospitality and warmth welcomes you the moment you arrive and remains with you long after you leave - as friends not just guests : true Greek 'Xenia'. Nothing is too much trouble, but not intrusive, or pretentious, and this little hotel and its proud hosts are just the tonic for a stress free holiday, we were sad to leave but will return. We found being in Perissa at the end of the season better for us as it was much quieter, but still nice weather and everywhere open. Anyway lots of repeaters and the reviews speak for themselves.......just go.",1
"This was our second visit, first was in May, and it's always a risk going back to the same place twice. No problem here. The owners Spiros and Hiroko treat you like part of the family ensuring your every need is met be it organising taxis to giving recommendations of where to go. I find this hotel really relaxing and accommodating and I will surely be back in the near future.",0
"Our third visit to this beautiful Hotel,Spiros and Hiroko were there to welcome us,(home)it is a little gem so tranquil nothing is ever too much for them to make your stay so enjoyable .Bedding and towels changed daily, pool towels provided,there just are not any down sides to this Hotel which is spotlessly clean,Spiros cleans his pool daily,gorgeous sunbeds and umbrellas .Across from the Hotel is Dorrians Bar another gem worth a visit (cocktails 3 or 4 euros)plenty of good tavernas Hellas being one of them located again just across from Zorzis We are returning next year .",0
"We stayed at this lovely boutique hotel on the beautiful island of Santorini in May and could not fault it in any way. It is meticulously clean (the smell of fresh linen hits you every time you enter your room) Spiros and Hiroko are fantastic hosts and nothing is too much trouble. It has an instantly relaxing atmosphere and at times we felt like the only guests with our own private pool. The wifi is excellent, we have never stayed anywhere else where the reception is so good wherever you are in the hotel. Can't wait to return.",0
"The Zorzis hotel is such a lovely hotel. This was our 3rd stay in 3 years, we weren't the only repeat guests either, most guests had been there several times.We like that there are only 10 rooms and that it is adult only.The hosts, Spiros and Hiroko are fantastic and want to ensure that you have a wonderful holiday, checking with you that everything is ok. Recommending days out and restaurants to try.Maria, keeps the rooms so very clean and leaves fresh towels every day.The whole hotel smells so nice and fresh and clean.The pool at the back of the hotel is refreshing and the loungers are comfortable. Spiros has a new robot to clean the pool, which he is very proud of.The gardens at the front and the back of the hotel are lovingly tendered to by Hiroko and the flowers smell divine. Lots of passers by stop to take photos of the flowers and even ask if they can look at the flowers in the back garden.Breakfast of Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, jam, honey, cakes, chees pie, spinach pie and lovely fresh bread with cream cheese, is served every day.There is not a bar in the hotel, but Spiros will share his wine with you at lunchtime and on your return from a night out - which is a great way to get to know fellow guests.The hotel is on the main road but noise is not an issue. There are lots of great restaurants and bars very close by and 2 wonderful bakeries, selling delicious cakes, breads and pastries. The Santa Irini bakery is our favourite.There is a bus stop to Fira right outside Bob's Bar which is next to the hotel.Free wifi is available all around the hotel, in your room and by the pool.We love this hotel and will be back.Thank you Spiros and Hiroko for yet another fabulously relaxing 2 week holiday in your delightful hotel.Val and Adrian",0
"This was our second visit to this beautiful hotel and we are not normally the type of couple to return to places as there is so much to see in the world. On this occasion we decided to make an exception as we had such a wonderful time when we spent our honeymoon here in 2012. We were a little concerned that it would not be the same the second time round but as soon as we arrived and walked up the steps to be met by the lovely Spiros we knew we were right to come back. It is such an oasis of calm and tranquility, Spiros and Hiroko are so caring and go out of there way to make sure that all of their guests have all that they require. The hotel is for adults only with ten rooms which are beautifully maintained as is the garden and pool area. Many guests return here and we can see why, we have ourselves booked to come again next September which says it all really. Thank you again Spiros, Hiroko and the lovely Maria who helps with the breakfasts and cleans the Rooms. We look forward to seeing you again next year. Karen and Gregg x",0
"We have just returned from our fourth visit to Hotel Zorzis and as before we had an excellent holiday. Spiros and Hiroko are fantastic hosts and do everything to make sure your stay is perfect. They are both so attentive to their guests needs and requirements. The Hotel is immaculately clean, as is the swimming pool. The gardens are beautiful with so many flowers and shrubs. It is so peaceful and relaxing in and around the Hotel, but only a short walk to the beach and the many lovely tavernas. We will certainly be back.",1
The hosts were amazingly friendly as soon as we arrived at the hotel. They couldn't do enough for us during our stay and even provided us with a couple of bottles of wine whilst we were there to drink on the balcony!Rooms were spotlessly clean as well as the pool area. Hotel is on the Main Street and only a 5 min walk to the beach. Huge Thanks to Spyros and his wife for looking after us! Will be back again.,0
Fantastic meticulous boutique hotel with wonderful hosts. Incredible pool and property that has been written up in magazines for good reason. We came here because friends of ours recommended it and we highly recommend this to you. Will be coming back!,0
"This is a beautiful and top notch B&B hotel, well worthy of all the nice things that people have written about it.The attention from the hosts is outstanding, they are friendly, helpful and caring. it felt like we were part of the family by the time we left.The hotel is on a busy road, but the pool area is to the rear so it is very quiet and relaxing. the whole place is dazzling clean, and the gardens are to die for, lovingly cared for like the rest of the property.Can't say enough nice things about the place really. The only thing to point out is it is only a B&B, there is no bar, no restaurant and no facilities apart from the pool. That's probably what makes it so peaceful and relaxing.We had a superb stay here and were very sorry indeed to leave. I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for this type of accommodation. Will definitely go back.",0
"It may not be a big brand, but zorzis gave me the best experience I ever had travelling abroad. I was travelling solo and the heart warming gesture and service are greatly appreciated. I highly recommend you to spend at least a night or two at perissa, with zorzis hotel, of course.   Room Tip: great service, hospitality, and home made yogurt See more room tips",1
"I have just returned from this hotel after a 10 night break with my girlfriend. We can't fault the place at all, it was amazing!!! The hosts Spiros and Hiroko are just perfect, they were very welcoming and are genuinely interested in making your stay a perfect one! The hotel itself is spotless, it's so clean and pretty. It is located in a good spot in Perissa, close by to the beach, restraunts and bars. If your thinking of visiting Santorini please consider staying here. We are already planning our return for next year!",0
"Where to start with this review..... I have recently returned from an amazing week long stay at the Zorzis hotel with my boyfriend, one which is going to be truly unforgettable. The hotel is ran by a lovely couple Spiros & Hiroko who could not do enough for us durging our stay, from providing island information, restaurant recommendations to lovely gestures of wine to drink on our balcony, they just could not do enough for us. The accomadation its self is stunning, spotless and smells of fresh jasmine. Rooms are of a comfterable size with private balcony, ours which overlooked the pool and stunning cliff views. Rooms also have a fridge which is good for keeping you beer and wine cool during your holiday. Pool area is kept imaculate by both spurious and his wife,and is surrounded with beautiful gardens.A lovely breakfast is provided each morning of fresh fruits,yoghurt, breads and pastries.Wifi was free of charge and could be accessed from all over the hotel and pool area. The hotel is in the perfect location with a bus stop to take you to Fira/Oia right outside the hotel. The beach of perissa is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel where there is a great choice of beach front restraunts and bars.If anyone is considering a trip to santorini I can not recommend this hotel enough, well and truly value for money,exceeded all expectations and I will sure to be returning next year.   Room Tip: Room 9 has a stunning pool view overlooking the mountain. See more room tips",2
"We stopped here for a week. It is situated on the main road in to Perissa, which can be busy but we didn't hear this noise when we were in our room or by the pool.it is a short walk to the beach. there are lots of nearby bars and a good bakery down the road. Spiros and Hikaro were helpful and warm hosts. The pool area is a good size for the hotel and we never had a problem finding a spot. It was quiet and very peaceful. The backdrop to the hotel was stunning, white mountains. We really enjoyed the breakfast which was always well presented and served - it always saw us through to mid afternoon. We really enjoyed our stay here.",0
"It is a really good hotel, but I disagree with most reviewers that believe this hotel is flawless. I don't feel like this hotel deserved 3/5 but neither did I feel it deserved a 4/5, 3.5/5 would be more appropriate. The staff are lovely and accommodating. Honestly I don't think I've encountered friendlier staff. The hotel for the most part is very clean and the beds are amazing! We stayed in Athens for a week prior to this hotel, and the bed there was rock hard so it was a nice change! The breakfast was very nice, but it was the same food everyday, and therefore got boring after the second day. Not so much as a complaint, but more constructive criticism towards the hotel to change it up a bit. Every room has a balcony as mentioned, some which are better positioned than others (inevitable), but still a nice touch regardless. The garden at the front was very pretty and the pool was a good size. My biggest complaint is the very slow internet. It was described as ""very fast"" on Expedia yet it took several minutes to load a web page in our room. Some may not have a problem with this, but it made checking emails and watching Netflix at night a real hassle. Also the actual shower is poorly built. Having a small shower space, and then having a curtain instead of a door and walls, leads to the curtain sticking to you and making the shower even smaller. The positioning of the shower head at your waist also made it a nuisance to use. The staff also happily give you a kettle and tea and whatnot if you ask - but when the maid cleans your room, it's never cleaned or topped up! Cleaning dirty cups should be a must surely? Also I don't think she ever cleaned the surfaces once. The location however is great. It is a short walk to the beach which is at most 5 minutes away and has nice restaurants. There's also two super markets and a bakery down the road from the hotel. I don't think this hotel deserves its ratings from what I experienced over the 7 nights here. As I said I don't even think it deserves a 4/5. But I did really enjoy my stay regardless. Would I recommend this hotel? Sure, but I wouldn't brag about my stay here. If I'm back on the island I will probably look elsewhere.",0
"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and we did really enjoy it.The gardens around the hotel are beautiful and the pool area was spacious and lovely as well. Our room had good air conditioning and the beds were very comfortable! Spiros and Hiroko were always nice and accommodating to anything we needed. The location of the hotel is great, about a 3-5 minute walk to the beach, with loads of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and a big supermarket a 5 minute walk away too. However there are some factors in which I have decided to rate this hotel a 4 not 5. Firstly, the showers are ridiculous. They are tiny and you have to hold the shower head above you as there is no holder high up. The wi-fi is really bad, the only place I had good wi-fi was near the pool area. Also although breakfast is very nice, I would say there is not enough option or change. Breakfast was given to you and everyday was greek yogurt, cake and bread and some other small bits. But after a couple of days this can get quite repetitive. I would also like to say that our room was cleaned everyday but not thoroughly at all. The surfaces were not wiped once whilst we were there and the mugs in our room were not cleaned or replaced either until we asked for it. Overall, the service at this hotel is amazing and the location is great too. We will probably stay somewhere different next time we come to Santorini but we did enjoy our stay here.",0
"I run out of words to describe the experience we have when we stay at this amazing hotel, Spiros and Hiroko are the most wonderful, dedicated and caring hosts we have ever had the pleasure to meet and would never stay anywhere else on the island. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the gardens and pool are stunning and oasis of calm, the rooms are cool and quiet. Centrally placed for beach and local resturants, bus stop near as are numerous car/ bike hire places to get you around Santorini.This is our second home and will definitely be returning every year for as many years as we can to stay with our Greek family Spiros and Hiroko.Thankyou for making another perfect holiday see you next year.",0
"Arrived home yesterday from our second visit to Zorzis. We are not ones for returning to a resort however Spiros and Hiroko have changed that. They are both very attentive without being overbearing. Hiroko is full of knowledge and tips of where to visit which she is keen to share with you whilst serving you breakfast. Spiros spends his time quietly making sure everyone is ok, parasol's beside your sunbed and the occasional caraf of wine in your fridge. Not forgetting the wonderful Maria who cleans the rooms and helps around the place. This really is a great place to spend your holiday. At times you feel like you are in your own private villa. The place is immaculate. Do not hesitate to book, you will not be disappointed. Also the beds are really comfortable and there is air conditioning in the rooms.",0
"If you are reading this review, thinking all these great reviews can't be true, I can assure they are, if not even better. I have have never stayed anywhere as clean, both inside and out. The hosts Spiros and Hiroko, are the nicest couple you could wish to meet. The pool is a dream, no one saving sun beds and so relaxed. It's almost at times like you have your own private pool. We will definitely be going back.   Room Tip: All rooms excellent, but only 10 so don't delay in booking. See more room tips",1
"Spiros and Hiroko are a really great couple and they made our honeymoon truly memorable. Their relaxed, friendly and personable style helped us to really enjoy our stay and we felt completely looked after from start to finish. The hotel is clean, bright and welcoming and our room was comfortable and well presented. The hotel is surrounded by beautifully tended gardens and the swimming pool is pristine. You can tell that Spiros and Hiroko take real pride in running the hotel and want you to have the best stay possible. Spiros went beyond the call of duty on our last day when my wife left her handbag in the hotel reception. We were unaware of this and on our way to the airport until Spiros called our transfer company to try and get them to come back to collect it. They refused and were going to leave us at the side of the road to try and get a taxi. Spiros found an alternative firm to bring the bag to us at the airport but said that this would not really be good enough as they would not know who we were. Spiros's car was having some repairs carried out on it at the time but he retrieved it from the the garage and drove out to the airport to meet us and return the bag to us. We tried to give him some money toward the fuel costs but he wouldn't accept anything from us. This was really far beyond what we expected of him. We would definitely recommend Zorzis Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing holiday with a warm and friendly reception and we hope to stay with them again in the future.",2
"having been to santorini many times we had seen this hotel and one day just walked in and asked could we look around --- WOW how lovely - everything looked perfect all white furnishings walls and fittings . the pool is set in gorgeous gardens and well kept.on our return home we knew we just wanted to stay at the Zorzis on our next holiday.the hospitality you receive is second to none with Spiros and his lovely wife Hiroko they just want you to have the sort of holiday you have always dreamnt about the breakfast is not your usual ""jam and bread"" affair you can sometimes get in greeceHiroko serves you lovely fruit yougurt cake etcthey are both the perfect hosts - nothing is too much trouble their hotel is truly a credit to them - we will certainly be back next year!!   Room Tip: all superb! See more room tips",2
"Every excellent review on here is correct. The hotel is completely faultless. The rooms are immaculate and the pool and pool area just beautiful with beautiful views of the mountain. Every room has a balcony which is fab. Aircon and quick wifi too which were a bonus. Perissa itself is great with loads going on and a great beach. The hotel is in a perfect location, with a short walk away from the beach, restaurants and a bus stop which goes all over the Island. We would recommend going to Oia as it's is absolutely stunning. The best selling point of this hotel is it's hosts - they are just lovely, accommodated to all our needs and were really interested in what we'd been up to and keen on making sure that we had the best holiday. We travelled as a young 19 year old couple and had a perfect first holiday together. Excellent value for money. Thank you so much Spiros and Hiroko xxx",4
"The service and hospitality here were outstanding. Our room was clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and we had everything we needed, including air conditioning, a safe and a fridge. The owners were incredibly friendly and helpful, especially when it came to planning what to see and do on the island. They gave us towels to take out on day trips with us and for the beach. There was a fantastic pool area that was clean and quiet with a great view. The breakfast was delicious. We can't recommend highly enough!",2
"Zorzis is perfect. Hiroko and Spiros are lovely hosts who work hard to ensure you feel welcome and relaxed. All facilities are immaculately clean, breakfast is delicious and every need catered for. incredibly good value for money, great location, easy access to main beach and restaurants. Can't recommend highly enough. Transfer from airport quick, cheap and reliable - hosts will arrange this for you.",3
"Just returned from the Zorzis in Perissa after spending a week in Oia . We stayed for 5 days and used the hotel as a base to explore the bottom half of the Island ,but also made use of the pool which is in a stunning setting . The owners Hiroko and Spiros could not be more helpful and I can only echo past reviews in that I highly recommend this hotel ,in fact my sister in law has already booked it . Only concern is that as more people discover the Zorzis we may find it difficult to book it in the future !!! Thankyou Hiroko and Spiros",1
"We spent two wonderful weeks with Spiros, Hiroko and Maria at the beginning of June. This was our second holiday with them at their beautiful hotel. Their hospitality and genuine friendliness goes beyond anything we have experienced at any other hotel. They go out of their way to make sure your dreams of a Greek Island holiday come true. The hotel is so beautifully kept and spotless. Breakfast is excellent and the fruit and yoghurt superb. You cannot fail to enjoy every minute of your stay here. Don't miss out on this lovely hotel and the lovely people who run it.   Room Tip: All rooms are superb and to a very high standard See more room tips",1
"Everything about this small hotel is perfect. Hiroko was waiting to greet us as we arrived, and she and Spiros were so kind and helpful it almost felt as if we were staying with family. Nothing was too much trouble.The hotel is ideally situated close to the beach, restaurants, bus stop, 24 hour bakeries and supermarket. It is immaculately clean, very tastefully decorated and the garden is a delight. The swimming pool was wonderful and there were always enough comfy loungers. Our room (no, 7) had a balcony with a view of the pool and garden, and the fan and air conditioning worked really well. The fluffy towels were changed daily, and the shampoo etc. replaced as soon as it was empty. My daughter and I are definitely planning to go back again next year, and I cannot recommend this lovely hotel highly enough.",1
"An absolutely fantastic hotel! This was our first time to Santorini, we enjoyed the holiday and found the hotel lovely and relaxing! So much so I have joined trip advisor to write a review as I feel this hotel deserves recognition! I would definitely recommend this hotel it's has a relaxing pool and jacuzzi, it's in close proximity to the shops, restaurants, bars and beach! It is very clean, pretty and in a brilliant location. Breakfast was also very good. Spiros and Hiroko are fabulous hosts, they are friendly and very helpful. The Greek financial worries are unnoticeable, cash machines are easily accessible throughout the island and there is one just a short walk from the hotel. Cyclades Restaurant is also worth a mention it is in close proximity to the hotel and serves amazing food! Thank you Spiros and Hiroko for the wine and such an enjoyable stay! We will definitely recommend your hotel to all our family and friends x",2
"We had a wonderful time at Zorzis Hotel, we didn't want to leave! The first thing you notice about the hotel is how immaculate it is.We stayed in a double room upstairs, it had air conditioning and a ceiling fan so you could adjust the temperature as you wished. The bed was very comfortable. Each room has its own wifi booster so the internet signal is brilliant. The owners Spiros and Hiroko are extremely hospitable, they take so much pride in the hotel and its grounds. The garden areas are beautiful.The pool is quite large and has a splash pool and jacuzzi joined onto it. There was always a pair of sun loungers available. Each day Hiroko offered us an umbrella incase we wanted some shade. Pool/beach towels are supplied in addition to normal towels which you can change whenever you need to.Breakfast was the same each day, greek yoghurt, fruit, bread and sponge cake. We didn't mind this at all however there are lovely bakeries a short walk away that sell all sorts of different cakes and pastries and a number of restaurants and cafes along the main street and beach. The beach is less than a 5 minute walk away, the sun beds are free if you have lunch at the restaurant/bar they belong to. Both Spiros and Hiroko were always happy to help, they made dinner reservations for us and advised us about transport on the island. When we left Spiros organised our transfer to the airport, which was much cheaper than a taxi. He also gave us a bottle of wine. We will be recommending Zorzis hotel to friends and family and may return ourselves one day.",1
"We so enjoyed our stay at Zorzis. You could not ask for a better hotel experience. The rooms are tastefully and beautifully done, the beds and pillows are wonderful. The breakfast was scrumptious. The grounds are lovingly taken care of, so bright and beautiful. The pool was immaculate. and our host and hostess were so helpful. We will definitely return to this island oasis. Thank you for your hospitality.Kate, the woman who loved your fish.   Room Tip: any room will be good. See more room tips",0
"This was our second visit to Zorzis, and it was like coming home. Once again we were made so welcome by Hiroko and Spiros who looked after us so well throughout our stay. The hotel is immaculate (thank you Maria), the gardens so beautiful, and the pool and Jacuzzi so relaxing for a wonderful holiday. The hotel is near the beach, and several bars and restaurants give you free sunbeds if you buy food/drinks there - we found Yazz very good. We can recommend Gods Garden ( 3 minutes away) for lovely Greek food and local atmosphere, whilst we liked Normas restaurant on the beach for something different. We stayed during the Greece/euro financial ""crisis"" and didn't have any problems with money or getting cash at all, nor did anyone else - don't believe what you see in the media. The people are all so welcoming, prices are excellent, and good value for money.We had a lovely relaxing holiday, and as we left Hiroko carried our cases to the taxi, Sprios gave us a bottle of wine, and waved us off as friends, not guests.   Room Tip: All are excellent See more room tips",0
"We left today and were so sad to leave. Spiros and Hiroko were so hospitable and nothing was ever too much. The grounds are fantastic with geraniums, hibiscus and Barbados flowers. Lovely quiet pool. The rooms are immaculate. Don't miss your chance for this little bit of paradise. Only 5 mins walk to the beach and centrally located to bus stops and restaurants. We will be back again.",1
"We stayed here for 3 nights booking at the last minute, we were so glad we did! Hiroko and Spiros are lovely hosts, they made us feel so welcome! Our room was really nice, Hiroko made sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast was very good too! The garden is lovely and the pool was just perfect! If you are looking for a hotel in Perissa then stay here!",0
First time to Santorini and so glad we choose Zorzis hotel.Spiros and Hiroko are wonderful hosts and the hotel and grounds are a credit to their hard work.I would definately reccomend this place to anyone who is thinking of going to Santorini .Its a great base to explore this fantastic island,0
"Anybody that needs a relaxing break needs to visit this hotel. Amazingly clean, well looked after gardens, brill clean rooms. Breakfast every day and pool towels included.If you want to be busy there is enough trips to do. But most can be done by local bus - €2.10 to Fira The day trip to Akrotiri / volcano / Oia. Is well worth itThis year we walked up to Ancient Thira, amazing site We had no issues with the banks being closed the week were there.Let's hope that any problems with money etc. gets sorted soon. It would be a shame not be able to visit Spiros & Hiroki. It always feels like coming home",1
Just got back from our first holiday in Santorini and Zorsis Hotel with friends who had been several times before and can confirm what a wonderful hotel it is. Hosts Hiroko and Spiros are wonderful and cannot do enough for you to make your stay as perfect as possible and they did! It is spotlessly clean and the surrounding gardens and pool are a joy. We are looking forward to going back again and again. Barbara & Mick.,1
"Just back from our 4th holiday at this lovely hotel,this hotel is as near to perfection as you could get anywhere in the world,we can not thank Hiroko and Spiros enough for making our stay so wonderful and we would like a special mention for Maria who keeps all the rooms so spotlessly clean,can't wait to go back. Cheryl&Charlie",1
Our stay at Zorzis was great! Staff was very attentive and they were helpful in making sure we had everything we needed. The location is great and the pool view is beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return there. I can't thank them enough for going above and beyond to provide us with an unforgettable stay.,2
Having been to Santorini 12+ times now and stayed here several times now I cannot endorse this place high enough---- it is our Greek home you are looked after like a member of their family.Nothing is too much for them and attention to detail is second to none.Not far from some great bars and lovely places to eat as well.   Room Tip: Any they are all individual touches. See more room tips,2
"I would like to give this hotel more than 5 stars, it deserves it, but the site will not let me.Myself and my wife have stayed in many hotels all over the world and I can honestly say that we have never been made to feel more welcome than we were during our stay at Zorzis Hotel in Perissa. Hiroko and Spiros have created a special place here. The hotel is immaculately kept and spotlessly clean throughout. The gardens and the pool area are a delight and provide the ideal place to relax and unwind.Hiroko and Spiros are delightful people, always there to help when needed, and committed to ensuring your holiday in Santorini will be a memorable one.",2
"Recently returned from another 9 great nights with Spiros and Hiro at Hotel Zorzis. They keep winning Trip Advisor awards and it is clear to see why. Everything is clean, neat, tidy and well presented. The pool and gardens are lovely and nothing is too much trouble for ones hosts, who are great people. Perissa has loads to offer and most bars and restaurants are great. Overall a great place to stay!   Room Tip: Just pick one - we've stayed in #5 and #7 - both lovely. See more room tips",3
"Just returned from our first visit to Santorini and Zorzis hotel. As others have said this hotel is beautifully maintained and spotlessly cleaned. The bathrooms may not be the biggest, but on such a beautiful island you won't be spending much time in the room and Spiros and Hiroko couldn't have been better hosts, providing plenty of helpful hints and tips to help us enjoy our stay on the island. We were a little hesitant at first in booking away from the main resorts of Thira and Oia but by the end of the week were really glad we'd decided to stay away from these more touristy parts of the island and saved ourselves a fair bit of money with plenty of reasonably priced restaurants within a nice stroll from the hotel and the bus stop taking you to Thira, Pyrgos (and the winery at Santos Wines which is well worth a visit especially at sunset) just across the road. We did hire a car just to give ourselves a bit of extra freedom but only for a couple of days as it was just too hard to tear ourselves away from the beautiful pool at Zorzis.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend!",2
"We checked into a hotel in Thira and on arrival hated it. We have stayed at Zorzis before and it is wonderful so we phoned Spiros to see if he had a room free, which thankfully he had. This is a friendly spotless and fabulous hotel and if you come to Perissa dont stay anywhere else. Spirals and Hiroko are great unassuming hosts and Chris and I just love it here and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Just a lovely hotel.   Room Tip: All rooms are lovely and spotless. See more room tips",2
"This is the perfect place to appreciate Santorini's beauty! We had the full Caldera view, the ocean and the sunset! It's also a distance away from the crowded Oia village but near enough for a just a short walk (while enjoying the view). All made even more perfect w the excellent service! Always ready and gracious to help and give us advise to enjoy our holiday better! Definitely will return Ikies if we ever return to Santorini!",0
"We stayed in the Captain's House at Ikies for 6 nights July 28-Aug 3 and it's hard to find the words to describe the incredible experience we had with every aspect of the hotel. The setting is absolutely staggering and by far the best location in Oia for both tranquility, views and accessibility without being in the middle of everything. The service was exceptional; intuitive and with pleasure. Bags are hauled to rooms in one fell swoop down the steep winding stairs by who we called ""Hulk""..Umbrellas are put up in the morning to shade you during your outdoor breakfast, and moved later if you need shade in the afternoon. Every square inch of the hotel is immaculate and clean and maintained daily, including the private tubs for the rooms. The food from the kitchen is brought to you on your private terrace and is delicious - the breakfasts are to order (and the hot things aren't really hot. But they are still delicious and perfect) Mezedes in the afternoon with some Assirtyko white wine was Greece, personified on a plate. Cheese plate by the pool.. it was all outstanding. Everything is very small scale on the outdoor grounds, including the beautiful pool that clings to the Cliffside We loved it all, and our room in the Captain's House was spacious. Not a ton of closet room but there is a living space and a separate bedroom. From what we could tell it was one of the most private terraces as well, and the private tub is completely tucked in and secluded. The views for sunset are unparalleled. We also got the honeymoon package, which frankly I would recommend to any 2 people who like French champagne, mimosas at breakfast, in room private massage by a therapist, and waffled cotton robes to take home. Excellent value.The most wonderful stay we have ever had anywhere. Thank you Ikies. xoxox   Room Tip: stairs to all rooms. If you have any mobility issues talk to the hotel as some rooms include a stee... See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed at Ikies for a few nights in the height of tourist season. Even though they were busy, the staff went out of their way to accommodate us and make our stay memorable. The rooms have recently been redone and are beautiful while still maintaining the minimalistic cave house feel. We will definitely be returning to Ikies for our future trips to Santorini. Thank you, Ikies!!",0
"Wow. My wife and I stayed in Winemakers House. Unbelievable how nice the room was. The views from the patio are unreal. The patio itself is huge with beautiful furniture and and a great private tub. Open concept bathroom with caldera view and steam room can't be beat. This hotel is a few minutes further from the shops and restaurants of Oia than some others but it is worth it. It's located on the edge of town gives much better caldera views as well as sunset views. Short walk to town. Truly a perfect location. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food and drinks from hotel are great. Breakfast on our patio every morning was delicious. Overall a truly great experience. My only complaint is that the house keeping service was very disappointing. For such a beautiful and classy hotel I would expect much better daily cleaning. They never truly cleaned the room. Just picked up a little bit. A few times they just rinsed out our dirty wine glasses and put them back. Aside from that, a great hotel.",1
"We stayed at Ikies for 2 nights during the peak of the European summer holidays in the Gardeners room.From the very first minute that we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with the warmth and hospitality that one would expect from a friendly greek town.Ikies had everything - wonderful views, beautiful rooms and helpful staff.What really did it for me was when we told the staff that we had booked a couple of nights at another hotel, we expected the levels of service to drop but not only did this not occur, the Ikies staff offered to move our bags to the other hotel for us.Loved the stay and would recommend to anyone visiting Santorini",0
Wonderful location. Far enough away from the hoards of tourists but an easy walk into town. We had a two bedroom suit with an incredible view. The staff is great and the food / snacks are also great. Wonderful breakfast as well.,0
We were in the Captains House with our two teenage children. It was by far the best trip we've ever taken. The staff was amazing and the view from our room/balcony was stunning. Highly recommend Ikies. You would not be disappointed at all!!!,0
"This was our first visit to Santorini and I am still in awe of the beauty of the view from our room at Ikies. When we arrived our hostess meet us in the parking lot at the top of hill. She also had someone to carry our luggage down the many steps to our room. We stayed in Cooks house which was 3/4 of the way down the hill with a spectacular view of the water and the city of Oia. Ikies is about a 15 minute walk from town making it much quieter and it gives it the best view toward the sunset. Our breakfast was brought to us every morning and it was set up on a private table with a view of the water and Oia a more romantic setting does not exist. We loved our room, the staff and the setting....truly magical.",1
"We had a wonderful 2-night stay in Ikies Traditional Houses last week. Communication was excellent right from booking - they sent a welcome email with practicalities (eg airport transfer) and activity/restaurant suggestions, and responded promptly to emails. The hotel setting is gorgeous, overlooking the caldera and facing towards Oia. You do get a sunset view from some rooms, though it sets behind the tip of Oia. Please note the hotel is about a 15-20 min walk to the centre of Oia, which was fine for us but may not be for others. We stayed in the smallest room - the sailor's house (room 1), which has a maisonette bedroom. The decor is very neutral & whitewashed which suited us perfectly. Shower a little small but no major issues for us. It was just in front of the pool, and we had some concerns it would be too noisy but this was not the case. Pool a little on the small side. The free minibar (first round) and daily free bottled water was much appreciated. Breakfast was made to order, plentiful and delicious!The hospitality extended by Anna and Maria was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for them, from organising boat tours, to moving our luggage to our next hotel in time for our arrival there after our boat tour!One minor issue was the wifi signal kept dropping during our first day - we later found out that another wifi signal could also be used; it would have been helpful to have been told that on arrival. All in all, would highly recommend this hotel. We paid approx 450 euros/night in July, which was more than I would have liked to spend, but appeared to be about average for Santorini hotels of similar quality in early peak season.",1
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights to begin our Greek vacation. The location is great. A little walk with a path to town. Much more quiet than the other hotels. The staff was so nice. They helped us with every question we had. The breakfast brought to your personal balcony was amazing! You get to pick what you want and when you want it to be delivered! The view from the balcony is too gorgeous to describe. Just imagine the perfect blue sea below you. The pool is a nice place to cool off. Lots of steps to get from main path to rooms as in everyplace in Oia. Amazing stay, would definitely to back again.   Room Tip: We stayed in the Sailors room. It has 2 floors. Good balcony right out of room. Next to pool. See more room tips",0
"What a wonderful setting! Romantic and peaceful yet so close to the township of Oia. The staff are so charming and helpful. They had excellent suggestions for restaurants and boat trips. We just loved our breakfast on the balcony overlooking the Bay. We walked to Fira (a two hour walk but so worth it), went out with Panos on a boat adventure and came back to our delightful little home in a cave. Sunset with a bottle of local champagne. Don't miss this place! It is a must!",0
"I was traveling with my husband and two teenage daughters. We stayed in the Antiquarian's House, which has two bedrooms, one on each floor (each providing adequate privacy). Words cannot describe how amazing this property is in every aspect. The staff is terrific. Dora, Maria and Anna took great care to make dinner reservations, call taxis, suggest excursions and shopping locations and problem solve. On our last day, we had several hours between the check out time and our flight. They arranged for us to go to a nearby winery for lunch and then they sent a taxi (with our luggage that had been picked up from the hotel) to pick us up and drive us to the airport. The caldera view from the balcony is stunning and the sunset view is unbeatable. The room was spacious, comfortable, clean, and well-maintained. They set up breakfast each morning on the patio, bringing as much food as you order at the time requested. The room service menu offers many choices, all delicious and delivered and set up on the patio and cleaned up after you finish. From the property, there is a direct walking path to town which is very convenient.I cannot say enough about how much we loved staying at Ikies. It is pricey, but we felt it was worth every penny and would make the same choice again. Absolutely amazing!",2
We were 3 girlfriends traveling together on this trip. Location was great- a nice walk with a good path into downtown Oia. The views were stunning. Simply amazing. Our favorite part of our stay was drinking wine on our porch. The beds were hard and uncomfortable however the decor was lovely and the customer service was excellent. It did seem to be more honey moon style- quiet and peaceful. Get ready to walk some stairs!!,1
"Perfect place to stay while in Oia, Santorini. All staff helpful, knowledgeable and willing to give great island information. Fantastic sunset views from your private balconies. Rooms were terrific as well. Highly recommend staying here!   Room Tip: Ask for a room that has a private balcony. See more room tips",0
"We stayed for 3 nights and words are not enough to describe this place! The hotel is in a great location, very clean and all the people working here are so kind and helpful that they make you feel like home. We will definetely come back !",0
"My husband booked one night here as a surprise whilst in Santorini for our 1st wedding anniversary, everything about it was amazing. From the first communications where they replied almost immediately to emails before we arrived up until the afternoon we left the staff could not do enough for you throughout. We were staying in Kamari and caught the bus to Oia, the staff told us what stop to get off at and met us there when we arrived to help with our luggage. We had a complimentary drink when we arrived and as the previous guests had checked out early they prepared our room for us to check in early. The staff also gave us recommendations on places to eat and drink in Oia town and directions on how to get there. We had stayed in Oia the year before but not in the same area. It is a 20minute walk to the main area & as other reviews have mentioned there is a short part of this journey that is not pedestrianised however this was not an issue for us. There are lots of sites, shops, restaurants and supermarkets on the way in so there are plenty of places to stop if necessary. This area is so much more private than the more central area & every part of it is breathtaking for the views, however it is worth noting that you can't see the sunset from the balconies so you would need to arrange to see the famous sunset somewhere else.We stayed in the Gardeners house and after reading some reviews I was expecting a small room. However I was very pleased with the size of the room, we had plenty of space & it's what you should expect when staying in a traditional cave house as most properties on this island are the same even in the larger hotels. It was very clean and well decorated. Complimentary robe and slippers are there for your perusal and the mini bar is stocked complimentary for your arrival with soft drinks, wine and beer. However once consumed you would pay extra for anything additional. We loved our balcony and despite it being on the main pool area it still felt very private as most guests do not use this area at all and go out for the evenings. We did experience another guest using it whilst we were there but I think it was more for a photo opportunity & they knew it was allocated to our room. I wouldn't say the other balconies next to our rooms were as nice as they overlooked the pool rather than the caldera. We ordered dinner to our balcony for the evening and as it was our anniversary were given a complimentary bottle of prosecco. The menu was quite basic (not lots of choice) but the food was good, we had mezzes and pizza to share. The breakfast the following morning was beautiful also. We made our selection and requested a specific time and it was delivered to our balcony, the fresh orange juice was the best I have ever tasted. I would definitely recommend this hotel, there are a few steps but if you're in Oia this is the case everywhere you go and we didn't mind being slightly out of the main area. The pool area is small but has a great view and can be used 24/7, it isn't used a lot by other guests as many have their own areas and jacuzzis so it felt quite private.",2
"Hands down my favorite hotel in the world. This place is simply the top of the line. First of all, the entire staff is exemplary. We could not have asked for more gracious, helpful service, including assistance with reservations, restaurant recommendations, and recommendations regarding various activities, including sailing. The location at the beginning of Oia is terrific, our room was terrific, and our view of the caldera and sunset was simply amazing. We are sad that our vacation had to end, because, among other things, this place was so great and we were so well taken care of. Worth every penny.",0
"There is not much more that I can add to the glowing reviews of this place. If you are contemplating this hotel think no further and just do it !!Its in a great location right at the end of Oia, which means you get the best views, you get amazing service from all the staff, you get clean well appointed rooms and at a great price.The breakfasts here are amazing so much choice and variety and all delivered to your own terrace.We stayed in the carpenters room which was perfectly fine for two people, it was right on the pool level so you were 2 metres from sunbeds and a pool. Our terrace had 360 degree views of Oia and was simply the best place to have breakfast and cocktails in the evening.The receptionist team were so friendly and the guys delivering your breakfast and sorting your suitcases out, what lovely people.I have no hesitation in recommending this place, we loved it so much that we are coming back again next year.   Room Tip: Carpenters room to get the best terrace with the best views. See more room tips",0
"We stayed in the cooks house for our first 3 nights and this room was lovely with a small private balcony area to enjoy the amazing breakfast and to enjoy the evening sun and sunset with a glass of wine. Room was a very good size with 2 bathrooms and a downstairs lounge area. On our last night we stayed in the house of the gardener which yes it is small but got everything you need and is a very good price plus in Santorini you don't want to be spending time in your room anyway so was perfect it also had its own balocony are a short walk from the room but was perfect location right out on the edge. We stayed in April and evening were chilly so take a good jacket or cardigan. With regards to ikies couldn't fault it at all the girls in reception were great. We did a catamaran trip which they arranged which was great. Breakfast was amazing as was location just at edge of town. We were recommended this place to stay and were not disappointed, would stay again if went back to santorini.",1
We had the best experience at Ikies. Everybody in the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and service was excellent. We stayed in the Carpenters room and loved it. Our only mistake was not staying longer. We will definitely be returning to Ikies.   Room Tip: View from all the rooms are excellent See more room tips,0
"IKIES is the perfect combination of an hotel in Santorini. First of all because you are in Oia, so in the very fancy part of the island, but at the beginning of Oia, so you have an amazing view of it, and still have the privacy of chilling by the pool without having too many tourists around watching you as the hotel itself it’s really secluded. We also had our private little balcony, with a jaw-dropping view where we had a our breakfast in the morning. Everything was perfect!",0
"We had a wonderful stay at Ikies Traditional Houses. We stayed in the Boatman's Room which was perfect for a couple. The jacuzzi was both hot at night to warm up and cold during the day to be refreshing. Breakfast was served every morning and was delicious. You can pick what you would like to eat and when it will be delivered (8-11 am). When we arrived at Ikies the receptionist and a porter were at the parking lot to greet us. They took our bags and showed us to our room. The women who work in reception are very friendly and can help you with anything you need. We were able to arrange reservations at top restaurants, taxi services, and a private catamaran (Captain Ted's) all through the reception desk with ease. Our room was exceptional. Modern air conditioning with a very large comfy bed. The Boatman's Room was very private. They had a large bed for sunbathing out on the patio which was both clean and comfortable. The small plates and wines at Ikies are amazing as well. They were reasonably priced and brought to the room promptly. We recommend the hummus plate and also the cheese plate. The hotel provides unlimited fresh bottles of water as the tap water is not drinkable. If I had one critique of our room, it would be the bathroom. It was very small and dimly lit. Aside from this, everything was perfect. We hope to return to Oia and stay at Ikies Traditional Houses again.",1
"This is the best hotel EVER! It is ideally located, the staff is amazing, and the views..... UNBEATABLE!!!!! From the moment you enter the property, it is breathtaking. Our room was amazing, with a loft that had a picture window overlooking the sea. It was spectacular. In the morning, a butler set up our breakfast on out private terrace. You can have all the food you want. You chose your menu the day before. We kept calling in for more lattes (2-3 more every day) because the views and the atmosphere were so serene. You almost don't want to go off the property it is so nice! The office staff were sooooooo nice. Use them to help make reservations for you. They would get us nice tables at nice restaurants at the last minute. All their suggestions were good. We got married in Oia, and when we got back from photo shoot, they had a nice bottle of champagne and some treats and a card for us. It was super nice of them. The path to the town basically starts at the hotel, you can walk for a long time, and all the views and buildings are gorgeous. My only wish is that I could have stayed twice the time! Fantastic hotel.   Room Tip: They all look awesome. See more room tips",2
"Folks, look no further. Ikies is THE BEST place to stay in Santorini. Not only is it perfectly located, but the team is phenomenal. Everyone was so kind, helpful, and truly made our honeymoon stay unforgettable. We stayed in two rooms - The Captain's House and The Boatman's House - which were both amazing.",0
We had an amazing time at Ikies!! It has arguably the best view of Oia (sunset and Calderon). We stayed in 2 different rooms - Carpenters and Gardeners- and could not have better things to say. The food was terrific and the staff was so friendly. So glad I took extra time to research and found the perfect place to stay in Santorini,0
"My husband and I booked the gardener's room for three nights in May. We took a taxi to Ikies (pronounced Eee-Kees, according to the taxi driver) and paid about 35 euro. Laura greeted us in the reception room and was so sweet and friendly, as was every staff member we encountered! The gardner's room is the smallest at the hotel and is located at the lowest level, so if you aren't good with stairs this room is not for you. We, however, did not mind. The public hotel pool is located right outside the room, although we weren't able to use it as the weather was too cold. Every room has its own balcony where breakfast is served as there is no common eating area. Most balconies are right outside the room, but the gardner's is a few yards away beyond the pool. It's worth it though as this balcony has the best view in the resort and is essentially hanging off the caldera. Breathtaking views! Other bonuses, everything in the mini fridge in the room is free and the included breakfast was delicious with many menu options. The room and bathroom is small but perfect for a couple. The shower didn't contain the water well, but overall it had smart functionality. Overall, I loved this hotel and would definitely stay again. The staff was fabulous. A++ customer service! Only downside is that it's a bit of a walk to the center of town and you have to walk along at really narrow section of road that got a little scary at night with traffic.",0
"Ikies was an amazing place for us to stay for our honeymoon. Over 5 nights we spent 2 in the Gardener's Room and 3 in the Boatman's Room.When we first arrived we were a bit disappointed by the size of the Gardener's room. It was much smaller than we had expected and we were unable to lay out our two suitcases (full size) at the same time. We did have our own little balcony perched on the edge of the property, right next to the pool. Though small, the room was nicely appointed and cozy, I think we had higher hopes and expectations as we were on our honeymoon. If you can afford it, upgrading to the Boatman is definitely worth it. For the last 3 nights in the Boatman's house we enjoyed slightly better views as we were up a bit higher, a larger room with a much bigger private balcony that had our own jacuzzi and outdoor lounge bed. We definitely spent much more time at the hotel these last 3 days due to the privacy afforded to us by the Boatman's house. Things to know:It's a bit of a walk to the town. We are younger and fit so this was not much of an issue for us, but there were times during our stay that we had wished we were a little closer (mostly when we just wanted to grab a quick lunch). BUT because of the distance to town I think that the views from Ikies are probably the best you will get at a hotel in Oia. The views were breathtaking and I believe you can get a full sunset view from the top of the property (we were out for sunsets).Breakfast each morning on our balcony was tremendous. Eggs cooked to order, delicious Greek yogurt, coffee, tea, fruit, pastries...whatever you want delivered at the time you want specified the night before.The staff was great. We received plenty of attention and had every request we made attended to in a timely and friendly manner. WiFi was not so great outdoors on the property. This didn't affect us too much but maybe something that can be improved.   Room Tip: Splurge for upgraded rooms if you can See more room tips",1
We had an amazing experience. It is expensive but worth every penny. I think it is the best hotel in the word. If you are staying in santorini make sure to stat in oia and specifically in ikies. The sunset in this hotel is the best in the world.,0
"My husband and I had a wonderful week in Ikies Traditional Houses. We went for rest and relaxation and we had it in abundance. We stayed in the spacious Cook's House and Maria and all of the staff could not have looked after us better. From the moment we arrived until we left we felt totally comfortable, relaxed and very well cared for. The service was relaxed and discreet and breakfast and lunch when we had it always delicious. Being on the edge of Oia was an advantage as we were away from the hustle and bustle but still well within walking distance. We had several delicious meals in Oia and Ammoudi Harbour. Oia is a village that every time you walk through it you see something different in the streetscape. It abounds with beautiful shops and there are particularly beautiful handmade crafts and art work available in several of them - some quite expensive. I cannot recommend Ikies highly enough and we look forward to returning. Binoculars would be a useful addition as the views and boats that pass by are gorgeous.",1
"This lovely hotel has amazing views and a great location, It is just outside of town which was perfect for us as we enjoyed the walk into town and yet were away from the hustle and bustle, The staff were very helpful in giving us advice and booking trips and making dinner reservations for us. Breakfast was delicious. Our view had a lovely terrace with great views of the Caledera. All in all a great hotel.",0
"This hotel was an amazing experience. We have traveled all over the world and stayed in many five star resorts. This hotel is so far above every other hotel we have stayed in. The checking in girls were great, they were so helpful and always there with a smile and a greeting. The location is the best location in Oia, The views were to die for and you had a quick five minute walk town, so you are away from all the boat crowds that get off the cruise ships and able to enjoy the true beauty without the crowds. Be ready to walk a few steps up and down to get out of your room to the top of the hotel, but great stair master work out. We stayed in the gardeners room, which is one of there smaller rooms however you have the best balcony in the whole hotel. Breakfast served every morning on your own private balcony overlooking the best view of the caldera in the whole island. You can't make a mistake staying here and we would definitely return!   Room Tip: All rooms are amazing, you can't miss with any of them See more room tips",0
"The Gardener's room is great! Not too small. Great views, but sunset better from higher lookout near hotel entrance. We especially appreciated the warm and helpful staff! Breakfast is tasty and prompt. You select items and set delivery time when you check in--if you want to make changes, ask the front desk the day before. The start of the hike to Fira is just off the parking lot in the back.",0
"Outstanding location outside Oia with a wonderful view of the city, sea and sunsets. Semiprivate terraces with easy access to a small pool. The staff is outstanding with great suggestions for local dining and excursions. The breakfast is served on your terrace and the selection and quality are excellent. This place is not advised for anyone with walking problems since there were 94 relatively steep steps to the walking path to Oia from our room.",0
"Excellent service. Breakfast served daily on the veranda. Fantastic view. Close enough to Oia restaurants and shops yet far from the crowd and noise, particularly during sunset. We have a wonderful time. They gave great recommendation on things to do and helped booking restaurants, boat trips, transfers and rental car.",0
"The most beautiful location you could ask for together with friendly efficient staff and the most delicious breakfast. We highly recommend a stay on this beautiful island at Ikies. Check the temperatures before you travel as there was a brisk chilly wind when we travelled at the beginning of May, lovely in the sun and fine when walking out during the day but jacket need in the evenings. Local buses plentiful and very easy to use for getting about.",0
Spent five wonderful days at Ikies - Traditional Houses in the Sailors House in October 2015. One of my most favourite accommodations ever! The Sailors House is located at the lowest level of the hotel with over 75 steps to the top - a great workout for sure. I loved having the swimming pool right outside our door and the amazing view of Oia and the water. The service was impeccable - from a delicious breakfast served daily on our patio to dinner reservations and tour recommendations - no request was too much. The location was perfect for a lovely evening walk into town for dinner and away from the busy sunset crowds.,0
"This was the perfect place to spend our honeymoon! The location is great. It is at the beginning of Oia so it is away from the crowds, but also easy to walk to everything. We were served breakfast on our terrace every morning so we could enjoy the amazing view. We stayed in the Captain's room, which I would definitely recommend. The girls at reception made our stay even better because they were so helpful. Everything they booked for us went smoothly. Everything was so great, we hope to go back!",0
"The stunning views and absolute luxury of the traditional houses provided a wonderful base for a weeks holiday.Maria and staff provided delivery of our suitcases to the rooms and they all had a huge smile every day. Nothing was too much trouble, it felt like we had family looking after us.Breakfast was a luxury start to the day, ginger tea / iced coffee, Greek yogurt and a cooked breakfast, it's a wonder I have not put more weight on!  Room Tip: Any with a hot tub See more room tips",0
"My friend and I had the most incredible time at Ikies last week - panoramic vistas, spacious mezzanine type accommodation and impeccable service. All hotel staff actively went out of their way to help us, even for the tiniest minute detail in our trip. Thank you so much, and I cannot wait to visit once more!",0
"We were incredibly impressed with the Ikies Houses--impressed in every way possible. Responsive, helpful, gracious staff with an immaculate and wonderfully maintained property. Everything that was written to praise the place was true. The view was fantastic, the unit wonderful (and we stayed in the tiny Gardener's House!). Wine awaited our arrival and when, the following day, the weather turned cold and rainy (very unusual for the area), we were brought freshly homemade chocolates and another small bottle of wine to enjoy our indoor respite quite out of the blue. Breakfast was wonderful, and we loved sitting on our ""private"" deck to munch on yummy pizza delivered with full flair right to the table. The price may seem daunting--but it is totally worth it. This was the end of a tour throughout Greece and the Islands--and it was a wonderful way to end the trip in relaxation and quiet in a LOVELY spot on Santorini.   Room Tip: Use the hand-held shower head in the small shower of the Gardner's room for best results (less w... See more room tips",0

"I don't even know where to start! We just absolutely loved staying here on our honeymoon for 4 nights. We stayed in the ""Carpenter's House"" (name of the villa). The view was exceptional of sunset, but also having breakfast served on our terrace was a once in a lifetime experience! The breakfast itself was amazing too. Very spacious villa with everything you could need - room was serviced twice daily, and anything you needed was a quick phone call or pop to the office if it wasn't already there - the girls were so extremely helpful with whatever we needed (booked us a boat tour - highly recommend), booked us massages to the room, explained how to get the bus into town (which we did with no issues) or arranged a car to get us if we preferred. Airport transfers were arranged also (for a cost of course but we found it very reasonable). It was about a 10-15 minute walk into town (Oia), which we didn't mind at all and about a 20 minute bus (or taxi) into Fira. Loved sitting in our jacuzzi on the terrace.The weather was really lovely our first day but quite windy the other days so pack swimmers but also something warm for walking around (and some stable shoes) if going at this time of year!!We felt very looked after here and the staff really make it easy and comfortable to ask for anything you need! Even checking out at the crack of dawn a staff member was there at the door to carry our bags up the stairs for us :) Loved it and the perfect ending to our travelling honeymoon.",0
"Stunning view!! We stayed in The Artisans room and it did not disappoint. The staff greeted us right out of the transfer. Service was without fault, always ensuring we were taken care of. It is a higher price tag but after staying there it was more than justified. In the rare occasions I have upped the anti, this is the first time I saw the value.",0
"There are plenty people give full 5 stars review hence I will keep it short and only highlight the points/areas that might bother some people and also the trade offs.1-location. The hotel is NOT right in the middle of Oia centre like other SLHs. It's about 5 minutes walk away from the hot spots of Oia centre. During the vey short walk, you will have to spend about 1 - 2 minutes beside a narrow main road with cars passing by you. A bit careful walking required.However, this does not bother us at all. We like the location as the upside of the small distance from the town centre gives you : A-quietness at night (no one keeps flashing cameras on top of your heads)B-amazing view of Oia town in your right side and undisturbed Santorini seaview on your left. This reminds me my staying in the Amalfi Coast.2-there is no restaurant to have sit down meals. All meals including breakfast are served in your room or balcony. My room got a gorgeous balcony. I would say probably one of the most amazing dinning spot in the entire Oia! But it is true that if it is a raining day, it probably a bit boring unless you got an amazing and spacious room.3-we stayed in the gardener's house. The smallest one but the one with the best balcony in our view. I would NOT recommend this one to family as it is very small only suits for small couple in my view. It is very nice room--cozy and well decorated and most important amazing value for money in Oia. I will also not recommend to any light sleepers though. It is directly under public stairs. So you will hear people walking in the early morning.Overall, I highly recommend this place and agree with all the other good comments about the hotel. The hospitality is honest and warm, right from the moment you make your booking. The hotel definitely invest properly into its property as a big downside in Greek tourist nowadays is that not sufficient investment and everything is wear and tear. This is not the concern in Ikies. We would come back and stay in the same place for sure. To give you a benchmark of my judgement and criteria, my next trip in May will be Bali four seasons. Anyway-Happy travelling everyone.",0
"Traveled to Ikies this past April for our honeymoon. It was our first time in Greece so we could only rely on TripAdvisor and reviews, but DAMN this place is incredible. They hooked us up with a free upgrade and everyone was incredibly helpful and couteous. My wife and I are already scheming to get back. Cannot recommend these people and this hotel highly enough. Seriously, if you're going to Santorini give them a look.",0
Stayed here with my family at The Collectors room. What a gorgeous place. Very spacious. Great views of the sunset. You can view the sunset lounging on the seating in the balcony or while sipping your drinks sitting in the jacuzzi. But what made the experience even better was the staff. Maria/Anna/Dora were all really helpful in recommending great restaurants (making reservations as well) and the boat tour. There was a little snafu when the boat tour charged us more than what staff had told. But this was rectified promptly when I notified them.Highly recommend this place.,0
We stayed here during our around the world honeymoon journey and cannot say enough positive comments about this hotel! Absolutely beautiful hotel with breathtaking views of the caldera. The hotel staff was highly attentive and really personalized our stay. They truly went out of their way to make our stay in Santorini very special. We have visited many countries and stayed in many hotels and Ikies was simply one of the best.,0
"After spending tireless hours researching, reading reviews, and looking at pictures of different hotels in Oia, my husband and I chose Ikies for our Santorini honeymoon. It was the BEST decision we made! From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff was incredibly hospitable and friendly. We chose to stay in the House of the Boatman due to reviews about privacy and it was a bit less expensive than other rooms. We LOVED it! The size was perfect for two people, the room was beautifully decorated, and the balcony & hot tub were absolutely amazing! Every morning breakfast was served to our balcony and it was always so good! The views from our room were incredible! The location was also perfect. Oia is such a touristy location but Ikies is located right as you enter the town, so you avoid the noise and traffic from the center of town. We walked to town every day, which is about a 10 minute walk. There are amazing restaurants and shops, and the staff at Ikies was always so helpful in recommending places to go. I can't recommend Ikies enough. If you're looking for the perfect place in Oia, this is it! And if you aren't comfortable splurging on one of the bigger rooms, trust me, the House of the Boatman is INCREDIBLE! You will not be disappointed!We're looking forward to our next vacation at Ikies!",1
"Beyond the gorgeous view, the staff is amazing. Two friends and I visited in May just for one night. It happened to be a bit chilly, but the rooms were nice and cozy. The food was wonderful as was the atmosphere. The thing that really made it special though was the personal touch of the staff and the hotel management. Even though we were only there for one day, they made me feel like a princess for my birthday. Where they really didn't have to go out of their way, they did and to me that makes all the difference in the world in really taking a wonderful trip to the next level. It's a beautiful hotel in a great location of course, the swimming pool overlooking the caldera is a fantastic addition. Secluded yet so close to the heart of Oia, it's a great place to stay for a relaxing get away or romantic vacation. However at the end of the day, it's the people who truly made it a memorable experience.",1
"Located at the entrance of Oia, very quiet and free of stress.But not so far away from the center of the village, it's pleasant to walk from the hotel to the center with the fascinating view.Every staff was so kind and friendly.Its renovated rooms were totally modern and chic still with the touch of Santorini traditional style.I stayed in Sailor's room right in front of the pool and it was easy to access the pool.The room has a high ceiling and the beds on the 2nd floor made me feel a bit cozy.Breakfast was made in the terrace in front of the room, you can choose the menu on your arrival.Everything was just perfect and I definitely want to stay there again",2
"We were lucky enough to spend 11 days at Ikies in September. Most people only stop here a couple of nights as part of a wider trek to a couple of islands, but I think I could have happily sat looking out at that view forever. The first part of our holiday was spent in the Collector's House, which is right at the top of the property. It's one of the old style captain's houses of which there are many dotted around Oia, and is beautifully furnished. It also has its own steam room and plunge pool / jacuzzi, which stretches out from inside the property to outside, giving a fantastic view of the bay and Oia itself. Many tourists come to Oia specifically for the sunset and walk through the town down to the ruined castle to view it, but if you stay at Ikies you don't need to do that - just sit on the balcony with a cocktail and soak it all up. This was also the one downside - a couple of nights we found tourist standing on the roof of our room, taking pictures of the sunset. The staff were fantastic - couldn't do enough for you, and even got me a cake, champagne and flowers when they found out it was my birthday : ).Last couple of days we spent in the Artisan's House at the bottom of the property. It's a smaller room (we couldn't take Collector's for the whole holiday as it was booked and our flights wouldn't let us leave earlier), but equally lovely and offers a different perspective on the wonderful view. So...yes, it is expensive. I did balk at the price when this place was first mentioned by my other half. However, within half an hour of being there it was clear it was worth every red cent. If I never go on holiday again, I will always have this to remember.   Room Tip: You could pick any and they'd all be fantastic See more room tips",2
"Ines and her staff do an amazing job to make you feel welcome. As others have said - the photos do not do Ikies justice. The staff maneuver the steps carrying 50 pound suitcases and large trays of food with ease... We stayed in the house of the Antiquarian which was perfect for 4 people- the Jacuzzi was an ideal temperature for the cool nights and the very large deck (although it is a cut through for other rooms) was amazing. I can close my eyes and see our plentiful breakfast laid out with the panoramic view- it really is heavenly. Something important to note is that this location is ideal You can walk along a path to all of the shops and restaurants in Oia and then take a quick (although crowded)bus to the bustling town of Fira, We did rent a car for one day which was arranged by the staff (easy) and it was a great way to see the island at our leisure and stop at some wineries. Our flight was at 6pm on the day of our departure and when Ines told us we could stay in our room as long as we liked - it was because they were closing for the season. You certainly could not tell by the attitudes of the staff they treated us like royalty!",2
"We stayed for one week in the Winemakers House at the beginning of October and everything was wonderfull, exactly as we had expected. Champagne breakfast every morning, great lunches and sunset cocktails, all beautifully served and presented on our own private terrace and which was undoubtably the best place to be in town!All the staff made our stay very enjoyable but thanks especially to ""our friends"" Lloella, Enese and Maria for looking after us so very well.There are a few steps (84 down to our suite) but that is a part of staying in a Traditional House on the actual edge of the Caldera, with such wonderfull views.Highly Recommended.",2
Focused and professional the staff of Ikies ensures every detail is perfect and your stay is memorable. Customer satisfaction is their highest priority and it shows. Situated just outside of the main Oia walkways ensures a more private and intimate setting for that romantic getaway.   Room Tip: The Boatman's room is located at the higher level ensuring more privacy. See more room tips,2
"This review is about the House of the Antiquarian', 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom.We stayed in this accommodation for 5 nights back in September. We paid more than 3000 euros, so basically is 600 euros per night. Not sure about the standards of luxury accommodation some people are used to but I am going to try and be realistic with the following facts and then everyone can judge freely.There are definitely issues here:1-privacy: there is none. People staying in the other two adjacent houses have to walk through your terrace to get out, sometimes even having to move your sunbed to let them pass. Many of the suites/ studios overlook your terrace also.2-interior: the living room doesn't have two traditional sofas as the Ikies website claims but just one with two 'dirty' poufs. The walls in the main bedroom are covered in mold with the paint coming off. We were told we had to leave the dehumidifier on all the time to stop this so doing so unless you have earplugs you won't be able to sleep overnight. The interior window between the lounge and living room doesn't shut properly. There is only one English channel, 15 channels in total, unfortunately I don't speak Greek. Breakfast was good: you can preselect it to have it served in your terrace at the time it suits you. Service is very good, they are kind and ready to help you at any time.Beds were comfortable but don't expect fine bedding, pretty basic and the same applies to bathrobes and slippers which don't fit at all.Please see pictures attached.Ikies is 10-15 min walk to Oia. Any questions please feel free to ask",9
"Can't imagine a better place to be in Santorini. The views, service, decoration, architecture, etc. Everything was perfect. We stayed at the Boatman's House and it was magnificent. With an incredible hot tub with stunning view of the caldera and the town of Oia. The breakfast is stupendously served every morning in the terrace of our room.The service was wonderful; they help us with any recommendation or any particular needs. This is heaven. No doubt the place to stay in Oia and all Santorini.   Room Tip: The Boatman's was great See more room tips",1
"If you want to have a relaxing time in Oia, with perfect views of the town but just far away that you can experience some peace and quiet but also be in the middle of Oia after a short walk then Ikies is the place for you. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. The rooms were beautiful with exceptional views but I would strongly recommend you go for the most expensive room you can afford because for each increase in price the room took on a new level of luxury.",1
"Where to begin...Ikies exceeded our expectations in everyway possible. Believe every glowing review that you read, because they're all true. My husband and I stayed in the Fisherman's Suite for 4 nights in late September 2015. When you arrive, you are warmly greeted by Ines and her team. Your bags are brought down to your room (which is no small feat with all the steps) and check-in is done in the room, which I found to be very lovely and personal.The room was beautiful and very large, the pictures don't do it justice. The fisherman's suite has two levels, on the lower level are the bathroom, couch/sitting area and a table with four chairs. It was very spacious, especially with the high ceilings. I was expecting the bedroom loft area to feel cramped, but it was also spacious. The bed and linens were heavenly. Both my husband and I had our best 4 nights of sleep at Ikies, as it was cool, quiet and dark. (the air conditioner works perfectly and they have dehumidifiers in each room) They are also both whisper quiet. The room decor is clean and modern, very nicely done. The shower water pressure was excellent and the shower was spacious.The Fisherman's suite is located on the pool level, in between the Boatman and the Gardener's Suites. My husband and I liked being down on the pool level, as we almost felt like we had our own private pool at times when no one else was there. Also, we spent a lot of time in the pool, so it was nice to be close. If you prefer a very private balcony, I wouldn't choose the Fisherman's suite. We liked it though, as we enjoyed chatting with other guests when we were down at the pool. We had a table and 2 lounge chairs on our deck right outside of the suite. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the rooms, they all appeared to be lovely.Breakfast---I am still thinking about the breakfasts at Ikies. It is incredible. Anything you could want, beautifully laid out, with white tablecloth, right outside your door, every morning. Did I mention you'll have one of the most beautiful views in the world to look at while you're enjoying your delicious breakfast?! Location-Great location! Ikies is one of the last hotels in the grouping of hotels on Oia, which makes it very quiet and private, just a short 10 minute walk into the main area of Oia. The walk itself is beautiful, as you follow a path with great views You are mainly passing other hotels that are closer to town; it was fun to check out the other hotels, but we preferred Ikies for its privacy and incredible views! :) You could see into peoples rooms/pools/balconies, not the case at Ikies. It is completely private.Service-Excellent. Ines was there to assist with anything we needed and even helped us set up a kayaking excursion. Everyone was excellent, from the front desk gals, to the cleaning crew, to the gentlemen who delivered breakfast and room service. It is a top notch team of people...the best, as far as I'm concerned! The views-Incredible. There is no better place to watch the sunset. We watched the sunset from Caldera Spa after massages one day and although it was still beautiful, we both commented that the view from Ikies was better.Bottom line-Book a stay at Ikies. It is beautiful, relaxing, and unique, worth every penny.We can't wait to go back. Thank you to the Ikies team for making our time in Santorini one to remember!",1
"This was a little bit of a splurge for us, but we decided to do it based on all the great reviews. Ikies did not disappoint. We had the smallest room, ""The Gardener's House"", and the small size was compensated for by the beautiful little detached balcony reserved just for us. This alcove seemed to hang on the side of the cliff, giving us an unforgettable 180 degree view of the Aegean, the caldera, Oia, and the hillside with all the beautiful ""cave"" hotels. And we had a perfect view of the sunset. This was where we had our to-order breakfast served, and each evening, we would go out there at sunset time for a glass of wine. Service was also excellent and unobtrusive. The staff really seemed to care. We would love to go back there and would recommend to anyone who, like us, does not want to be immersed in a noise ""party scene"".   Room Tip: All rooms have great views. This property is on a steep hillside, so be prepared for some steps. See more room tips",1
"Love the fact that the hotel is located at the beginning of Oia and away from the busy crowds. And it's only a short walk away from town centre. Beautiful sunset views and the staff very very friendly and helpful and we had a wonderful time there. Rooms were well kept and spacious. Would definitely recommend this place and stay here again when I revisit! If you thinking of doing the scenic hike from Oia to Fira, the start of the hike is also nearby.",1
"Just got back from our wonderful trip to Greece, and the Ikies Hotel was definitely one of the highlights. We loved everything about our stay:- Oia is great. We really enjoyed Oia is being more laid back than the rest of Santorini, and in general smaller than the other options we looked at.- The location in Oia is great: I think Ikies is the last hotel in Oia, but still not far from the action. . . the result is, you don't get any crowds, and the view is spectacular. . . the location being at the far end gives you a perspective that you don't get in other hotels.- The Service is great: All Greek hotels seem to offer great service. Ikies differentiated a bit by doing everything just a bit better, and by being that much more knowledgable and helpful. The difference also seems to be that, I rarely had to ask for anything, the seemed to volunteer to offer suggestions at just the right time. . . and they seemed to want to talk with you.- The rooms are great: They are very cool, individually unique rooms with great views and all the right finishes. Ikies was a beautiful little place. We were thrilled with our time there. We stayed at two other hotels on the islands, both highly rated, and they did not compare to Ikies.",0
"If you want the experience of a private Greek villa in Santorini, this is it. Located at the southern end of the pedestrian walkway from the center of Oia, Ikies Traditional House provides privacy, quiet, and commanding views of the caldera. Moreover, you can avoid the masses at sunset while admiring its glory just the same as you sip champagne on your own private terrace. The staff is johnny-on-the-spot responding to your each and every whim, and the charm of the place is infectious.The Room: We booked the Artisan, a cool, sparkling cave into which we gladly retreated from the blistering Aegean sun. The comfy, king size, memory foam mattress rose above the main floor on a platform, allowing the welcoming living area with a beautiful, lighted wall sculpture to be admired from above. The design was clean and peaceful. The bath area reminded us of Whoville (from How the Grinch Stole Christmas), and the arching architecture was enhanced by beautiful Venetian-style tiles throughout. The room was outfitted with natural textiles (hemp, coconut, etc.), from linens to bathrobe to slippers, which were comfortable and environmentally-friendly.The Pool: The pool area was small, and quite a hike downstairs from the upper rooms. Worth the trek, the water provided for a clean, clear, and relaxing afternoon dip. My only recommendation would be to update it to an infinity-style pool and get rid of the only ""hand rail"" I saw on the entire property. The Food and Service: The hotel offers only breakfast onsite, which was included with our booking. We were spoiled by the timely delivery each morning to our linen-covered patio table, with umbrella hoisted, and a gentle tap on our door to alert us that breakfast had arrived. It was arguably the best part of the day -- enjoying a french-pressed coffee while feasting on views of the sea and Santorini hillside. Our double-futon sun bed awaited with pillows fluffed, as did our tepid private hot tub for a cool morning dip. Late in the day, the hot tub was heated to a warmer temperature and we always returned after dinner to find candles glowing on our private terrace. It was a nice touch. Finally, they were well-connected with prompt and responsible drivers and kindly set us up with transfers from the ferry to the hotel, as well as a private tour of the island. The few things that could use improvement weren't enough to convince me it was worth less than a five-star rating. I would definitely stay there again.",1
"For all the hotels in Oia, watching a stunning sunset from your room with a glass of wine in your hand is part of the deal, so after all, it is all regarding services that make your vacation turns from great to distinction. We really got Inese to thank for, as she did help us thru from picking our resturants to our sunset sailing. Give us such a memerable trip to remember for our life. Thank you so much",0
"This hotel was, by far, one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed in. It is situated a 15-minute walk from the center of Oia, but the solitude was relaxing and calming. The rooms are magnificent, service was first class (I CANNOT STRESS HOW AMAZING THE SERVICE WAS), and meals were fabulous right down to the scrumptious breakfast each morning served right outside our door ...When we needed advice, the managers were spot on with everything ... even down to restaurant recommendations and activities ...STAY HERE! DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! JUST DO IT!   Room Tip: Higher room is better!! See more room tips",2
"upon laying eyes on the steps down, you are awed by the breathtaking view of the sea below and the white wash north of you, could not stop taking pictures. We booked through True Greece and we were told we had the Winemaker room, but somehow we ended up with the Antiquarians room. Which was fine ,but still makes me wonder what the other room was like. and some mentioned champagne with breakfast. we did not see that. but the room was spacious!! two bed rooms, two bath, so we could spread out! the long patio had a great view of the sunset, and we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast and hot tub as well. Location is great, not in the heart of town, but a 15 minute walk away. very quiet on our section. Staff was AMAZING, i love the free water every day, they are more than accommodating, all of them! our last day, our pick up was not until 3:30 in the afternoon. we had 3 hours to kill. sat by the pool, ordered drinks, then they had a cute little shower room where you can change and get ready. perfect. OVERALL FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE.   Room Tip: the large patio rooms have a great view, but not a lot of privacy. its a through way to other rooms. See more room tips",0
"I stayed for two nights.I booked the hotel online about 1.5 months in advance, and already received email information from them about sightseeing, hiking, tours etc. once booking was confirmed.My arrival was early in the morning, the transport from airport was arranged beforehand with perfect timing, and it was not expensive at all. The room was not yet ready for check-in at early morning but I was able to repack some of my luggage to store at the reception, and go off to a hike to Fira. Once back from the hike I was promptly checked in and have all the time to relax in my room, which is very spacious and tidy. The outdoor jacuzzi is completely relaxing and luxurious.The view is perfect and picturesque since the hotel is situated at a high vantage point. You can even catch the famous Oia sunset in the comfort of your room.A wide range of food is available for choice for breakfast. Excellent quality food also available from room service.I needed to leave in the early morning on the third day, the staff were very thoughtful to put breakfast items in my room in advance. Check-out was also performed in advance so I was all set and ready to go at 5am. Perfect arrangement!   Room Tip: The Boatman's House with beautiful view and an outdoor jacuzzi. Totally relaxing. See more room tips",2
"We just returned from 5 nights at the House of the Collector. It was not our first trip to Ikies and we were very excited about our return and seeing the renovations that were made to the hotel. There were not many changes to the House of the Collector but the changes that were made to our room were well thought out and added some freshness to the room. Many of the other rooms had more extensive renovations (new furnishings, etc.). The hotel is doing what I think they need to to continue to meet/exceeed expectations of their guests.Service - This continues to be the main reason we return to Ikies. From dinner reservations, to rental car, to directions, the Ikies staff were eager to do what they could to ensure that all details were addressed. They confirmed reservations at the restaurants without us asking. I can't say enough about all the staff at Ikies.Food - Since our last visit, they have increased the size of the kitchen so they are able to expand some of their breakfast and lunch/evening offerings. The food was all great and our evening cocktail was something we looked forward to each night.Location - We love the location of the hotel -- just a 10 minute walk from the main part of Oia which allows the hotel to enjoy the privacy of the location. The sunsets from the hotel property are amazing and we loved watching it from our balcony each night. It was again a great visit to our Ikies family and we thank them for making our stay wonderful.",0
This boutique hotel is amazinnnnng and it HAS IT ALL!!We stayed in the Boatman's House... We where surrounded by all the luxury finishings... A private balcony and a hot tub AND incredible views!!!All of the staff where extremely friendly and accommodating. The man that carries all the luggage up and down those stairs is amazing!!!We decided to stay in and watch the sunset with dinner and cocktails. The food was fantastic and the cocktails VERY YUMMMMY!!!We will be back!!!,1
"We loved our stay at Ikies. It was in a quiet area of Oia yet just steps from all of the restaurants and shops. The staff was overly accommodating; they gave us several excellent restaurant recommendations, helped us arrange a catamaran boat tour and arranged an ATV rental for us. It was such a lovely boutique feel, the breakfast was great and the views were incredible. We stayed in the Sailor House which doesn't have a private pool but the public pool is directly in front. It was spacious and perfect for a couple. If we are ever back in Santorini we will certainly stay here again!",0
"Is it possible to give a hotel 10 stars?? If yes, I'd like to give 10 to Ikies for a fantastic stay during the first two nights of my honeymoon. Although we spent more on those two nights than on the rest of our lodging during our ten days in Greece, it was well worth the cost. We stayed in the Boatman's room which has a private terrace and outdoor jacuzzi is one of the highest rooms in the hotel. The view was everything they say it is and the room felt incredibly luxurious and private. Staff were friendly, helpful and respectful of our space, and helped us with recommendations and general information about the area. The room service menu was reasonably priced, and the breakfasts included with the room were amazing, fresh and served with genuine care. Although we had our jacuzzi (which was always kept perfectly cool during the day and warm at night), we also spent time at the pool which was perfectly sized and perched right at the edge of the cliff, with shared lounge chairs for all guests to use. Ikies was all-around a fantastic experience and an extremely well-run hotel that is worth every penny. We can't wait to return!   Room Tip: The Boatman's room was amazing and felt very private. Definitely worth the extra cost for a pri... See more room tips",3
I did a ton of research before my husband and I visited Santorini and had a difficult time picking a hotel. We just returned from our trip and I am so happy we chose Ikies!! We had some passport trouble on our first attempt at this trip and had to reschedule and the team at Ikies worked everything out for us and changed things around quickly for us.I always worry that hotels won't live up to your expectations and I was excited when this hotel exceeded them. First off the hotel is beautiful and views are absolutely stunning. We stayed in the Carpenters room (honeymoon suite) for our first three nights and then the Artisan for our last night. I would highly recommend the Carpenter room as it has such a high end feel and tons of room plus a very large balcony. The Artisans was good but a tougher switch for our first experience. It's still a great room though with a nice patio. I 100% believe you should splurge for a room with a hot tub. Experience wouldn't have been the same without them. I won't repeat too much of what other reviewers say about the location and the views of the ocean and town as many have said how amazing it is. Secondly the service here is fantastic. They respond so quickly to every request and really go out of their way to make things perfect for you. We ordered dinner and ate it on our patio two of our four nights and it was amazing. We ordered drinks through out the day and they promptly brought very nicely made beverages to our patio. We also loved the breakfast each morning with the amazing view. Just book this place.....you won't be disappointed.   Room Tip: Carpenters room was fantastic. Choose a room with a hot tub for sure! See more room tips,2
"My wife and I stayed at the Ikies for our honeymoon and it was amazing. The best service and staff. The best views and rooms. And even great food, particularly the breakfast you eat on your balcony overlooking the ocean every morning. My wife and I can not so enough great things about the Ikies and would absolutely recommend it. Also we want to personally thank them as our on last day we were both sick and they rearranged rooms so that we could keep our room passed the normal check out until we left for our evening flight. Thanks!",3
"Oia is a beautiful place and all the hotels perched along the cliff have awesome views. So does Ikies. We stayed in 2 different rooms and both were very comfortable with superb views of the Aegean Sea. The staff were very responsive and everything we called for, reached our room in about 5 mins. While the rooms were lovely, they did not have commonly placed things such as a kettle and tea/coffee bags. We did however get a kettle when asked for.The sunset point is at the other end from where the hotel is.   Room Tip: Highly recommend the Captains House See more room tips",3
"I'm from Greece. So at the risk of totally discrediting myself and rendering this review worthless, I must start by saying, yes, I'm biased because this is my country, and yes, I believe Santorini is the most beautiful place on planet Earth, and yes, speaking of Earth, we invented everything. That last part was a joke. Not really. If you're thinking of going to the Greek Islands and you have been reading reviews about Santorini, then you will have already read a hundred reviews by now telling you that Oia is stunning and magical and incredible. You don't need me to tell you, but I'm going to anyway. Oia is stunning and magical. It is jaw-droppingly beautiful. You will find yourself trying to understand how it's even real, that's how beautiful. This hotel does the beautiful, transformational, Utopian place that is Oia the justice it deserves. Service began before we ever stepped foot on the property. Any questions or correspondence we had were handled with genuine Greek hospitality and care. I don't need to tell you about the views. The rooms are impeccable.I would be shocked to know that anyone might come to this place and stay at this hotel and not have the experience of a lifetime. It's been almost a year since I was last in Santorini and I am truly sad about that. Next year, next year.   Room Tip: The Captain's Suite is worth it See more room tips",4
"My Wife and i have just returned from one full week staying in the Winemakers House at Ikies! We have to say that this was one of the most wonderful and relaxing breaks we have ever had. Oia is a stunning place to visit anyway so on top of that to stay in such a beautiful and extremely well run Hotel/Traditional House we were truly blown away. The entire property was out of this world. Completely first class from top to bottom. All of the guys running and working at the hotel were exceptional and could not have been more attentive. If we ever asked for any food or drinks there was never a issue and they arrived almost instantly, they were also outstanding and fresh, delicious and extremely well presented. Sitting on our terrace looking over the ocean with the famous sun setting drinking the hotels fine cocktails was extremely spectacular! They arranged all of our transfers to and from the airports and even though we were delayed coming to Santorini our transport was ready and waiting for us and then we were greeted at the road drop off point by the manager and her assistant to take our luggage down the steps to our room. Champagne on ice all ready and waiting. What a lovely touch by them especially as it was very late. We really could not ask for any more from our trip. So thank you to all at Ikies you deserve all the acclaim what a wonderful trip!!!! Would definitely come again...",2
"We stayed only for one night for our anniversary and had booked the fisherman's suite but were upgraded to the captain's suite at no extra price. The room was nearly 250 euros more than what we had paid for and was absolutely spectacular. Spotlessly clean, private, own private pool and the best view of the sunset going. All staff were extremely helpful: they ordered food from a local takeaway for us without issue and even came down to our room to take a photo for us at sunset. They also booked us a table at a restaurant for the evening. Nothing was a problem. Breakfast was incredible as was the standard of room service- the best whisky sour I've had in Santorini. My wife and I had an incredible first anniversary and one to remember for many years. Hopefully we will be back in the future. Thank you so much.",1
"You cannot find fault in IKIES. Correspondences made prior to arrival were handled professionally and promptly. The warm welcome upon arrival was superb. The room was amazing. We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) and what I loved about it was there were two T&B's! The room was very spacious and comfortable. The terrace with the views were astonishing. The breakfast was delightful. The location was perfect. There was parking for our rental car. But most of all, THE STAFF. Their recommendations were always spot on and they really took time to make our stay very special. All of them were amazing - Inese, Loella and Maria. Loved our stay here. Wonderful wonderful time!",0
"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon in September. Before we even arrived they were great. I must have checked on the reservation three or four times to make sure things were set. They arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport and were very helpful to change that pick-up time throughout the day as our flights were changed. We arrived without luggage, and they took care of tracking it down for us and getting it to the hotel. I don't know how we would have found it without them!We stayed in the Captain's house, which has a huge private patio and a hot tub. It was mostly private, although the path that leads out does go by the entrance, so there would be occasional traffic. I would stay in this one again. It had a living room and kitchenette and a separate bedroom (also with a view). The staff would come change the locations of the umbrella throughout the day to provide shade.My husband still talks about the champagne breakfasts. We would sit on the patio of the Captain's house all morning and just gaze across the caldera. I am seriously sad writing this, because I want to get back as soon as possible. A few days we ordered drinks and snacks to enjoy before getting ready for dinner. Everything was wonderful!We stayed for five nights. Not enough. Oia is now probably my favorite place on Earth. The hotel made wonderful restaurant recommendations, both casual and formal. They also helped book a boat trip for us (also awesome).Ikies, I miss you.   Room Tip: Did not feel we missed anything by staying in the Captain's House. See more room tips",2
"This is one of the few hotels where the reality is as good as, if not better than, the pictures on the web. The hotel is beautifully done, the rooms are spacious, and having your own balcony (some with hot tubs) is wonderful. The location is terrific- just outside of ""downtown"" Oia, a short walk, and no noise or crowds. We stayed in the Boatman, which was delightful, especially at the end of a long day sightseeing; you can't beat ordering up a bottle of wine and some mezedes and watching the sunset from your balcony. The staff is absolutely wonderful, accomodating, and well connected on the island. Luella (I hope I spelled your name correctly!) was outstanding, and made our time on Santorini everything we were hoping for! Many, many thanks! You can't make a better choice. We will definitely be back",0
"We celebrated our one year anniversary in Oia and staying in the Ikies really made it special. From the moment we arrived, Luella and Innes (apologies I'm sure I am spelling these incorrectly) were the perfect hosts. It was so nice to be around people who were genuinely happy and interested in ensuring our holiday was wonderful, not just putting on smiles because we were the client. And the rest of the staff were always extremely sweet too. The hotel is in the perfect location, just a few minutes walk to the main strip of Oia, but you get the most wonderful view over the whole town. We were in the winemaker room, which had the best terrace and Jacuzzi., The Jacuzzi was almost as large as some plunge pools we've had before and we spent every evening in our Jacuzzi, watching the sun fall behind Oia with a cocktail in our hand, truly relaxing. The room itself was lovely, gorgeous cave like bedroom, where we slept so well. A nice living area and a good sized bathroom. After getting used to this room, we were very disappointed when we moved onto a 5 star hotel on another island where the room was tiny.The honeymoon package is well worth it, we took our morning champagne and made mimosa's, a nice kick start to the day! And enjoyed our sunset cocktails everyday. The massages were quite possibly the best we've ever had and fortunately they also travel to costa rica each year, so we'll be popping over to get another massage!Santorini is a lovely place to explore, we took transfers all over the island and spent one day with a lovely tour guide called Andromica, who took us to wineries, archeological sites, the oldest tavern, beaches etc, A wonderful day!Staying at the Ikies was a truly wonderful experience, thankyou so much Luella, Innes and all the other staff! We'll be back",0
"The service, the view and the location are absolutely the best! The rooms were clean and the variety with the daily breakfast menu was something we looked forward to every morning. Thank you Vassilis, Kostas and all the staff for making our stay in Santorini magical. Highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when we come back to Santorini.",0
"Thank you to Vassili & Staff, for making our stay so wonderful. The breakfast daily, was amazing. The view from the hotel is spectacular. The sunset view from our hotel room or swimming pool were unforgettable. The location is where you want to be. The staff were wonderful and were very accomodating for our 2 year old daughter. On our last day our ferry was cancelled due to bad weather. Vassili went above and beyond to help us organise new ferry tickets and an additional nights accomodation. Overall our experience was wonderful and we are looking forward to returning in the futur",0
"Don't hesitate to book this hotel if you are looking for authentic. Greek hospitality. We have just spent 10 nights staying at Villa Renos and would highly recommend it to family and friends. There was the opportunity to sample genuine Santorini speciality dishes at breakfast alongside a buffet of hot and cold items. Uninterrupted view over the caldera, but good central location to the town. Vasilis and his team couldn't do enough for us to ensure we had a fantastic holiday.",0
"This hotel was the highlight of our trip. We stayed at quite a few places on our trip and this was the most unforgettable. The view, the service, the breakfast. The breakfast was my food highlight of the entire trip. Each morning you are served something special made from their very own garden, it is three courses and there is no better way to start the day. The service was faultless. From the moment we got out of the car there was someone waiting for us to take our bags down all the stairs. There was always someone there to answer any questions. The view speaks for itself. The location was good too. Right in the middle of Fira. The furniture and bathroom is a bit dated but you spend all of your time looking at the view you don't really notice. A must when staying in Santorini!",0
"This place is amazing to say the least. To start with the location , it's a postcard spot overlooking the famous caldera and lagoon where cruise ships anchor. The staff are all very helpful and available all the time. The hotel itself is located in the middle of everything , the beautiful narrow streets , bus terminal , taxis etc.. . The breakfast is amazing home made delicacies that are made daily and included with the stay. The rooms are clean, beautiful traditional and all with unmatched & clear views of the caldera & lagoon that you wake up to every morning. If you're looking for a great family run boutique hotel this is your place.",0
"By far the best place to stay in Santorini. Spectacular view, traditional Greek hospitality, delicious breakfast (don't forget to try Yiayia's fig jam - amazing) and centrally located in the heart of Fira but quiet. Vasili is a wonderful host. Truly makes you feel at home. This is the second time we have stayed at Villa Renos. We will be back! Hopefully next year! Yiamas!!!",0
"Hotel Villa renos is the best place you can have in santorini. All the rooms have a great view and all the confort you need. Moreover, Vassili gives you many recommandations which are priceless in santorini, thanks to him and his advices, you will make this trip one of the best you will ever have. I wish we could have stayed longer.",0
"On this trip we stayed in 6 hotels. Our route included Athens, Mykonos, Santorini, Vienna, Salzburg and Munich. While all of the hotels we chose were excellent what separated Villa Renos from the rest was the personal service. We had some rather heavy bags with us and Villa Renos benign the middle of Fira had no parking. The staff there gallantly carried all our bags to the hotel form the parking lot which was maybe 1km away. Every morning my wife would visit the front desk and make plans for the day dependent on the weather. A trip to Delos, 2 trips to local wine yards, and even shopping recommendations. Everyday the breakfast was brilliant. While the spread was not elaborate whatever they served was home cooked and it was a treat to eat some authentic home cooked greek food. The room was clean but spartan with a good view of the bay and we could see some lovely sunsets without even making the trip to Oia like is recommended.They organised a rental car to travel locally and there were daily pickups and drop offs from the city centre between 8pm and midnight (dinner time). All in all a lovely stay. Highly recommended.",0
"Villa Renos is perfect in every way - location, accommodation, breakfast, staff, advice all first class. We stayed in room 9 which was stunning. It is more like an apartment gouged into the rock with a lounge area, toilet, main bedroom with a further 2 single beds on a mezzanine level above and a cave like luxury bathroom reminiscent of a Moroccan Riad. It has a private terrace with a 180 degree vista of the the famous Caldera, and a dedicated spa pool. All of the reviews rave about the breakfast and we ertainly were not disappointed. Each day brings new delights followed by bacon, eggs and sausages if that is your preference. The owner, Vassilis, is a great host who prides himself in making sure your every need is taken care of with warmth, good humour and exacting standards. My wife and I first met in Santorini 22 years ago and we went back to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Our stay at Villa Renos was just amazing and with it being in the prime location to enjoy the Caldera, we could not have chosen a better place to stay. You will love it and you will oh yes you will! With much thanks to Vassilis and all of his excellent staff, Mark and Siobhan",0
"We recently stayed here and the location was brilliant. We had a room with our own private area and spa outside which was wonderful to spend afternoons relaxing in the sun. The views were amazing. While the room furnishings are dated they are still comfy and everything works well. The breakfast was magnificent, a different selection each day, including desert! All the staff were so friendly and accommodating. We would stay here again.",0
"Great location,close to the town of Fira,spectacular views to caldera,nice sunset,great service and hospitality,excellent breakfast,clean rooms with balcony,we had an excellent stay and we will be back",2
This place was amazing. Thank god for the porters. The view was magnificent breathtaking view. Our own spa. View of the ocean and sunsets were amazing. Food all home made breakfast. So thoughtful and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. The gentlemen that served us were very helpful and fun to chat to every breakfast. Clean room and private balcony. Absolutely loved villa renos and will go back.,1
Arrived and wasn't sure what to expect. What a fantastic surprise when we opened the door in our room to see a private patio and access to a shared plunge-pool and all with a view of the caldera and the beautiful sunset! No need to face the masses when you have s private viewing spot. Great location right at the top of the town & walking distance to everything Fira has to offer. Rooms are clean & well appointed.,0
"We are staying here for 4 nights at this fabulous hotel. Small property which gives it an intimate feel. We are staying in the junior suite - 2 levels, amazing bathroom, private jacuzzi on the balcony. It is honestly the best place I have ever stayed at. Service is incredible. Breakfast different every day. Highly recommend.",1
"The reviews have all been excellent and this is no different. Visited on honeymoon and after staying in Europe for a month, this was our favourite and most romantic location. Very accommodating, excellent service and the breakfasts were definitely a highlight of our whole trip. So authentic and always expect a sweet dessert! The view is absolutely second to none and our balcony was also very private. Rooms were spotless and room service very efficient. Loved it!",0
"We arrived May 30th, mid-day for 4 nights after a short flight from Athens. Parking is available nearby with a short walk and then Santorini's obligatory steps. This was my second stay at Hotel Villa Renos, Porter service is available if you leave your bags in your auto (please be prepared to tip). The room was ready early and the view outstanding. Their was a Wonderful smell of food from the kitchen, my wife asked if it was for dinner? We were told it was for tomorrow's breakfast, and everyday everything was served inside, or on a balcony lanai... and served with a smile, truly great gourmet-like food served by chef Miss Bona. I have 35 photo-files to add to this review, given that I still believe that the old axiom that a picture is worth a thousand words...I hope you are helped great with my review and pictures. . .   Room Tip: Hotels are mostly on the side of the caldera, you could ask for a 'higher' level room and sa... See more room tips",3
"Read excellent reviews perhaps skeptically, but they were dead on...the location within FIra couldn't be better, the room (Junior Suite with Caldera view) was excellent and well appointed, and the staff was incredibly warm and friendly. And I have to agree...the breakfasts and food in this hotel were some of the most memorable of the trip. Fantastically good. We met another couple who loved the breakfasts and hotel so much that they booked their trip around this hotel's availability.I travel a lot and typically stay in big brand hotels, was thus skeptical of what I'd experience at a small, family run boutique hotel. Couldn't have been happier! The rooms are well appointed and modern, the views are amazing. Would definitely seek this hotel out again.   Room Tip: We stayed in a Junior suite. It had a private balcony with a small hot tub, and a loft bedroom. See more room tips",0
"Thank you Vassilis for everything. You and the staff at Villa Renos have made our stay in Santorini very comfortable and enjoyable. Exceptional service, breath taking views. We have stayed in the upper villa with the private balcony and outdoor jacuzzi and our daughter stayed in the lower room with a terrace. Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds and big wardrobes. The friendly staff have organised the car hire for us and provided great recommendation and direction to the best beaches on the island and very good surrounding restaurants. Arranged for our laundry service and transport to the airport and carried our heavy luggage up and down the stairs. We had breakfast at the dinning room terrace overlooking impressive views of Santorini, the food and service were very good. I would certainly recommend this place to others and go back there again.",1
"Cant say enough about how great this place is. Perfect location, the view is absolutely amazing and the family running the hotel are the best hosts. Every restaurant recommendation was on point and the homemade breakfast they served daily was out of this world. If we ever make it back to Santorini, will definitely stay here again.",0
"Stayed for 7 nights and Villa Renos from June 18th 2016. What a great little hotel, perfectly positioned overlooking the harbour and volcano in the centre of Fira. We had room 1 with a Jacuzzi on the balcony and loved it, spacious, private, clean, huge bed, air conditioned, great bathroom and shower. Special thanks to Vassilis and the staff who made us feel very welcome with some great advice on what to do each day at breakfast time. The breakfast was amazing 3 hand prepared local dishes then a sweet plus a buffet of eggs sausage and bacon to fill any gaps.",0
"The Villa Renos is run by a great owner/host. I stayed, with my young adult children, in the big two story suite which was part of the original structure. Balcony small if that matters to you. View is everything. Suite Fantastic. Also stayed in another room upstairs for one night. Room and larger balcony good, could use new mattresses. The food for breakfast is exquisite. Staff is exceptional. Lots of stairs but worth it for anyone who can manage it. I WILL STAY HERE AGAIN. No need to try another as far as I am concerned.",0
"First of all, the location is perfectly convinient-- only a few steps from main road in Fira, cafes, shops, bus stop are all nearby as well. But most of all the breathtaking view from your room makes this Hotel the perfect choice! Every morning you wake up to the magnicent view and then watch the beautiful sunset from your own balcony! And of course... how can anyone who stay here forget the very special homemade breakfast!!!",0
"Three ""girls"" 50+ travelling together and we stayed here at Villa Renos, Fira, in the Grand Suite.We were in two minds whether to stay Fira or Oia but on reflection we made the right choice and the Villa was one of the reasons as the location is perfect - you step out to the main part of the town where you can eat and shop to your hearts content. The local bus (which we took to other towns) is a few minute walk as is the cable car.The service at Villa Renos was fantastic from pick up at the ferry and drop off to the airport - so glad we didn't have to carry our suitcases. Each morning the breakfast was a surprise as they always bought out 3 different delicious foods plus a desert to finish which was a delight as we sat looking out uninterrupted to the Caledera. That coupled with fresh squeezed juice plus additional selections from a small buffet meant we were set for the day ahead.Our suite was large with a large bed on the ground floor and two doubles up on a mezzanine floor. The latter may be a challenge if you don't like climbing narrow stairs, but then again you only have to sleep there. As for the bathroom... it's bigger than my bedroom at home and there was a second toilet off the living area. We had our own outside juccuzi which was well used at the end of a long day walking. We also had our own sundeck with uninterrupted view our to the Caledera and where the sunsets were fantastic - we did go to Oia but our view was as good. Just be mindful that the umbrella on the deck is not 100% UV which I found out the hard way getting my face burnt lying under it for most of the day without sunblock.Like all of Santorini there are plenty of stairs and you have to climb down to the suite but it's worth it - they carry your suitcase.The only downside is that you can hear trickle of water down the walls at night which may disturbed light sleepers however with everything else being so perfect, I say just wear ear plugs if you really must.We are all so glad we got the opportunity to to stay at Villa Renos and enjoyed seeing the donkeys go past our Villa at the start and end of each day.",1
"The views from our terrace were spectacular. The room was very nicely appointed and immaculate. This is a family owned hotel. Included in the price of our room was a fabulous breakfast. The recipes were those of the mother Zina. They would rival the food of any 5 star restaurant. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Helping serve in the morning was Petros, the delightful young son of one of the owners Vassilis Mateka. Vassilis made us feel welcomed and was happy to assist with suggestions as to what to see and how to get around the island. We highly recommend the Hotel Villa Renos and would love to return in the near future.",0
The perfect hotel with the best view the most helpful crew and amazing breakfast Santorini is wonderful the hotel just makes it perfect. Allways take care of you help you with restaurants and allways with smile,0
"This hotel is perfection in every aspect. Location 5 minutes walk from Fira bus station but quietly and idyllically situated on the edge of the caldera with 180 degree views of the bay and town stretching left and right, and below to the old port. Owners couldn't be more accommodating and hospitable at all times... and the breakfasts...!!!! well, more perfection! - a fabulous different inclusive gastronomic experience each day of our 5 night stay. Immaculate room and balcony areas with use of jacuzzi were perfection plus, and the whole experience was all that one could ask or expect from a holiday. Villa Renos is THE place to base any exploration of Santorini, whether walking, public transport, or boat trip, and we were made to feel very much 'at home' there in an unforgettable way. ""Poli Efharisto!""",0
"I booked a room here after reading all of the wonderful comments about Villa Renos. My daughter and I were here with friends for their daughter's wedding. Santorini is absolutely beautiful but our stay here was even more special because of our choice of Villa Renos. Every attention to detail was appreciated...the cleanliness, the amazing daily breakfast, the friendliness of the entire staff and the picturesque views from all the balconies. I could tell this is a family business and Vassilis takes great pride in making customers' stays perfect in every way. You will be very happy staying here!",0
"A perfect location for your stay in Santorini. The views are magnificent, the rooms are immaculate. The breakfasts are totally unique and every morning a different delight will be presented to you. The staff are very friendly and also very helpful. Staying there is a fantastic experience.",3
We truly enjoyed our stay! The breakfasts were unbelievable as was the view. We felt like we were staying with family as everyone was so friendly and helpful. This hotel is close to lots of great restaurants and shopping.,0
"This place has everything you could ask for. Modern, clean comfortable rooms. A view to die for. Outstanding location. Vassillis, the host, is charming, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. The 4 course breakfasts which are different each day are amazing, especially since everything is home made. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: I think all rooms overlook the sea and the caldera. See more room tips",0
"Absolutely stunning view of the Caldera is what first hits you when you open your drapes in your room. Bill (English translation), who I presume to be the owner, is a wealth of information and is willing to part with this Information upon inquiry. He made us feel truly at home and treated us like family. One of the first questions he asked is if anyone had a breakfast preference (wife is a vegetarian) and the breakfast was amazing. The staff at the hotel is extremely pleasant and very helpful in Bill's absence. Located at what I would call the east end of the ""tourist"" strip the hotel is ideally situated to be able to get you anywhere you need to go in Fira and is close to the main bus terminal as well as taxi locations. After traveling Greece for 13 days this hotel will be one of the highlighted stops on our trip and I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Santorini.",1
"Vassilis is a great host. The location is excellent and he gave us many good tips about things to do, places to see. The breakfasts are also fantastic. A nice small hotel that feels like you're staying at a family home. And they accommodated our small dog!",0
"From the very first, Villa Renos did not disappoint. Easy communication to obtain a ride from the port of Athinos led to a lovely gentleman helping with our bags. Situated below the caldera rim giving unobstructed views of the sunset from our patio. A gorgeous room with a cave like bathroom and the best rainfall/jet shower of life drained all the stress from traveling and rejuvenated after every day of activity. The team who oversee the day to day were very welcoming and always ready to assist. Breakfast is fantastic as well! Traditional Greek options and a complete American style buffet. We were fueled to enjoy the island. Strongly recommend and I know you will entirely enjoy your stay at Villa Renos!",0
"The perfect place to stay in Fira, or Santorini for that matter!!!Unbelievable scenery, wonderful suites with own hot tub.The breakfast is a clear example of excellent Greek cuisine, and they also throw in the English breakfast (WOW!).Host is excellent at catering to all needs and goes out of way to accommodate requests.We visited at the beginning of the season so we had all the good weather without the thousands of tourists, unbelievable and serene :)   Room Tip: If you want the ultimate in privacy and comfort, the big suite is the way to go! How does a private... See more room tips",0
"We booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and we are so glad we did! We are a family of 5. We traveled with our three kids ages, 18, 14, and 6. We stayed in the Grand Caldera view suite. It was absolutely perfect! When we began researching whether we should stay in Fira or Oia, we had a tough time deciding, but we liked the reviews on this hotel so much that we ultimately decided to stay in Fira. Our views were incredible and the sunset was magnificent. We had a private patio as well as an additional patio with a hot tub both overlooking the caldera with perfect views of the sunset. My 6 year old would hang out in the hot tub while the rest of us had appetizers from a local deli and my husband and I drank local greek wine while watching the sunset. Just perfect.Vasillis arranged for transportation to pick us up from the airport and take us to the hotel. It was a short 10 minute drive or so from the airport. Very easy. The steps were not bad at all getting down to our room. I was a bit worried based on reviews on how my 6 year old would do, but he ran up and down each time without issue. Breakfast is the best breakfast I have ever had. Ever! We could not wait to see what breakfast would be served each morning. The food comes from Vasillis's family farm on the island. It is all fresh and absolutely delicious! This alone is worth the stay at this hotel let alone the accommodations, view and outstanding staff. Our room fit the five of us very comfortably. It is a cave style room with a master bath worthy of every travel magazine's 5 star ratings in my opinion.While on the island, Vasillis arranged for us to take a catamaran sunset cruise around the island. I highly recommend this. The staff on the boat were outstanding, knowledgeable of the island, and very helpful. They also kept an eagle's eye on my six year old even though I was right by his side. I could see how much they cared about each of their guests. The boat ride consisted of a couple of spots to get off to swim, which we all loved swimming in this beautiful sea. It also included a lovely dinner consisting of Greek salad, prawns, chicken, fresh bread, wine and unlimited drinks for everyone. We toured around the island to see the caldera, the black, red and white sand beaches as well as other sites. Very worth doing!Vasillis also recommend that we take the hike from Fira to Oia. I had read about it online but was not sure how my 6 year old would do. We are so glad we did this hike! My little man did just great and even ran some of it. The rest of us enjoyed the views of the whole island, the little churches and stops along the way, as well as the different terrain that we encountered along the walk. It took us about 3 hours one way. We then shopped and ate in Oia. It is a very neat town that I highly recommend visiting. It is what you see in Greek travel magazines with the pristine white buildings and the blue roofs. Gorgeous. We then took a bus back to Fira in the afternoon to catch the sunset from our hotel.:)We did not rent a car, and we are so glad we did not. You can travel to anything you would like to see by bus and Fira is the hub for the bus stops. The roads are narrow and the traffic can be heavy so for us, we did not want to deal with any stress of driving. We mostly walked to everywhere we wanted to go. Fira has outstanding restaurants, which Vasillis can recommend for you, as well as a ton of shopping and sight seeing. We visited the museum in Fira which had artifacts from Akrotiri where the volcano buried a town and it's people much like Pompeii. The kids enjoyed learning about the history of the island and seeing how people lived thousands of years ago. We also visited a few beautiful, old churches. There are over 300 on the island! We shopped a lot while in Fira and took the cable car down to the port one day just to see what it was like down there. While were there, the port restaurants were not open yet, but were planning on opening April 15th. I would guess that would be a great spot to have some lunch.As far as the time of year that we went, I would HIGHLY recommend it. The weather was perfect. 65-70 in the day and in the 50's in the evening. We were wearing shorts and tshirts during the day and would put on light sweaters or sweatshirts in the evening. Most of the shops and restaurants were open and the crowds were minimal compared to how we are told they are in the peak season. I can not imagine what the island is like during peak season! It must be packed down every shopping street, crazy on the roads and the busses must be insanely packed as even when we road the bus, we were packed in like sardines and I was literally stuffed into the stairs of the bus for the entire bus ride. We were able to get into every restaurant we wanted without a wait and the prices of the hotels are better than during peak season. I was worried we would find that most restaurants and shops would be closed, but that was not the case at all. We never felt like we missed out on anything. When it was time to leave, Vasillis arranged for transportation again to pick us up to take us to the airport. We had an early flight so they picked us up at 5:20am. We loved every minute of our stay in Santorini and at Villa Renos. We will be talking about this trip forever! It was more than we possibly dreamed it could be!

"It was my daughters idea to come to Santorini, and since we are Americans living in Italy, we couldn't resist. Searching through TripAdvisor and other sites we found Villa Renos. The reviews were stellar, and since we have been here now for 6 days, I can see why. Vassilis, our host and his staff, as well as the rooms, pool, balconies, and the breathtaking views of the Santorini volcano, have made this stay in our top 10. And we travel a lot around the world so that should say volumes. Everyday Vassilis and his chefs, prepare some delightful delicacy- all local and fresh from their farm. Cappuccino, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice. Our daughter is a vegetarian and they took great care of her needs. Vassilis also told us where to take our first hiking trip, and it was strenuous but just what we wanted (it was to a large rock outcropping) that gave us incredible views of the caldera and Fira and Oia. He also arranged our boat and hiking trip to the volcano and then a swim to the hot springs on another island (same trip). He arranged our rental car through Tony's (his daughter Maria). And we took two full days visiting all the great sites around the island, including our favorite Red Beach, and the Akrotiri archeological site. Villa Renos is an excellent investment when you come to visit Santorini. We had the room with the jacuzzi and loved it. But the pool is heated too. We will happily return and stay at Villa Renos.",1
"I'm not a review-kind-of-person, but after spending four nights in Villa Renos, (in beautiful Santorini) I was compelled to express my true appreciation of the place, and the people who run it. We couldn't have been happier with both the Fira location, the view, the care of staff and the quality of design of the place. This is an intimate and personal hotel, with great diverse and versatile home cooked breakfasts and very attentive, kind and caring staff.We really loved every minute in Villa Renos. So there it is.",1
"We booked Hotel Villa Renos based on Trip advisor feedback and it exceeded our expectations. The hotel owner/manager was so nice & helpful. We could see the values, they stick to running a family business. The hotel is located quite central in Fira, so if you stand in the balcony, you can equally see both sides of Fira. The room was quite decent. There are some books in the shelf, so if you did not bring your book, no worries :). We have seen one of the best and beautiful sunsets from our balcony. Other best part of the hotel is the home made breakfast. I have no hesitation to say that it was the best breakfast we had in our Greece trip. You will be served hot breakfast, just made from kitchen right away. The sweet crepe served hot was delicious. You can enjoy your breakfast either sitting inside or outside with a great view. As our flight to Santorini was cancelled due to bad weather, we were managed to stay only one night/2 days here but we would love to come back to Santorini and stay in this hotel. See you soon :).. Finally, we highly recommend this hotel to have a pleasant stay in Santorini/Fira.   Room Tip: I guess every room has a private balcony with great view. See more room tips",0
A beautiful place and such fantastic hosts. Staying here really made our trip to Santorini fantastic. The best views on the island were from our balcony! The most delicious breakfasts topped off an amazing stay.,0
"This is a lovely villa that has simply the best caldera view of the sunset! Vassilis was a most accommodating and gracious host, and we loved sitting out on our balcony to watch the gorgeous sunset (it's true what they say about Santorini sunsets-different every night!) We had a room with a private jacuzzi, which was the best way to cap off the night. The four course breakfasts were to die for and a great way to start the day. We would not hesitate to recommend Villa Renos to all our friends!",0
"Villa Renos ranks as one of my favorite hotels ever! We have traveled to different countries and stayed in great places, but feel Villa Renos is in the top 5! I traveled alone due to a work schedule. The breakfast is the best of any BandB ever. Multi-courses and changes each day. You won't be sorry! The listing says double bed, but I'd call it a queen. Love the balcony and the view is to die for. The owner is beyond gracious and helpful in every way.",0
"My friend and I stayed at Villa Renos for 4 nights, and it was truly one of the highlights of our trip. The hotel itself is cozy, clean, and is situated in the perfect spot overlooking the caldera. The best part , though, is the family who owns & runs the place: they were kind (and hilarious), extremely knowledgeable, and made a fantastic multi-course breakfast every morning! I would go back in a heartbeat.",0
"We stayed here in Nov 2015 for 4 nights and I am so glad I chose this place. We booked a superior room and the balcony opens up to a panoramic view of the caldera and has the most stunning view of sunset (even better than the sunset point in Oia!). The rooms are big and nice and the breakfast is to die for! Bill, the owner of the place and the entire staff are extremely hospitable. They made us delicious breakfast, something different every single day and it was traditional Greek breakfast made from fresh organic ingredients grown in their farm. I've never had such yummy Greek food before. I am a vegetarian and Bill was very sweet enough to make breakfast as per my requirements. He truly went out of his way to make our stay memorable. The location is great too. It's in the main town of Fira and just 10 min walk to the main street with restaurants. Highly recommend this place. If I ever go back to Santorini, I will definitely stay here!   Room Tip: Get the superior room for best views. See more room tips",3
"We stayed in this hotel just for a night, and just wished we had extended the stay. The hotel is situated in a pictursque location right in the midst of Fira town, overlooking Caldera and the blue ocean. The balcony is pretty big and is having a Jacuzzi with hot water. It is a unique experience to relax in the Jacuzzi viewing the blue ocean and the luxury liners right below you. Breakfast is included in the room tariff, and was very good, though limited in variety. It is served in the balcony again overlooking the ocean. Dont miss to taste the thick greek honey that serve!You will have a good sunset view right from the balcony, so need not visit any other place for the purpose.Rooms were quite spacious and very clean with comfortable beds. This hotel is highly recommended while staying in Fira, Santorini, Greece.   Room Tip: Try for a room facing the ocean and Jacuzzi in the balcony. See more room tips",1
"Wow! This is the perfect place to stay in Santorini! The view is incredible (I would totally recommend getting a hot tub room), the folks who run the hotel are very hospitable and knowledgable about the area, and the price is reasonable! Bill, the owner, bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable and our stay was just as we had imagined. He even served us breakfast every morning, and it was DELICIOUS!! They used fresh ingredients and every morning they served something unique. We really enjoyed it, and highly recommend this hotel!!!",0
We stayed 4 nights and loved every minute. Villa Renos is a family owned hotel and the manager very friendly and accommodating advising us on restaurants and booking our boat trip to the caldera. The staff were fantastic and the breakfasts delicious. Our room had a hot tub which was just superb and the views simply spectacular. We were in walking distance for any shopping needed as well. Cannot fault our stay and hope to return soon.   Room Tip: All rooms have fantastic views See more room tips,2
"Me and my wife spent 6 days in Villa Renos for our honeymoon and it was amazing!!! Bill and his whole staff were the nicest people you can find and were always willing to help out. They always had suggestions for great places to go and the breakfast was out of this world. To top it all off, we had the best view on the island from our hotel room! I plan to go back to Santorini and will definitely be staying at Villa Renos when i do!",1
"We stayed at Villa Renos during our honeymoon and have nothing but rave reviews. The entire hotel is built into the hillside, and each room seems to have its own breathtaking view of the caldera. It is right in Fira, so you have easy access to everything on foot. Our room was the largest deluxe suite. It was huge, with a second bed in a loft, a large front room, its own private jacuzzi with curtains for extra privacy, a private balcony to soak in views of the caldera day or night, and an impressive and beautiful bathroom with an enormous shower. We learned later that the room was a 300+ plus year old family residence before it was renovated. Amazing. The owner was amazingly kind and helpful. He went out of his way to take care of us in every way, from transportation, to restaurant recommendations, to some champagne to toast our honeymoon. Breakfast was very good (and even better with the exquisite views), freshly prepared dishes that used produce from the owner's nearby farm. We really loved this place and would highly recommend it.",0
"Had a wonderful time in Santorini. Beautiful room with incredible view and amazing breakfast. Staff at Villa Renos was very helpful and helped us getting back to Athens via ferry, before the general strike which would have been a huge problem without their prompt interventions.",1
"The hotel is staggered on the hillside facing the caldera, assuring that every room has a magnificent view and terrace. I truly felt that the best view of the caldera on the entire island was right from my own terrace.The owner, Vassilis, is friendly and most helpful. He was generous to a fault, giving us a room upgrade, early check-in, late check-out, one could not ask for more.The breakfasts were grand, also served on a terrace facing the caldera. We had to get used to having ""desert"" at every breakfast. Other Greek specialties were also served.The room itself was a little small, the plumbing old, but none of this seemed to matter next to the stunning views and friendly service.",1
"We had a great stay in Villa Renos, good location and convenient for tourist, the host is so thoughtful and caring, fantastic view of Fira from our room, equipped and tidy, breakfast is fantastic, too!! Highly recommend to friends to stay with them for visits!!",1
"We stayed for 3 nights in October 2015 in a standard room. The view was amazing and the home cooked breakfast just as good. Vasillis organised car hire and showed us where to go on the island and booked a volcano and swimming tour for us which was also excellent. Overall a great family run hotel with only 8 rooms, right on the donkey trail with great views. I would recommend it when staying in Santorini",3
"Had a 3 night stay in Villa Renos. Great place to stay. The owners and staff were warm and friendly and couldn't help us enough. They even had a porter to collect our bags from the bus and carry them down to the Villa and our room.The view was brilliant. The food was magnificent with all the vegetables home grown. We were given (3 courses) homemade meals for breakfast which were excellent.The room was lovely and big and we even had a Jacuzzi on our veranda which was filled, nice and warm for when we arrived as it was raining and a spa in our bathroom. Plus there was free WiFi available.We were close to everything: restaurants, buses, shops.All the rooms had great views and I wish we could have stayed there for longer. We would love to go back to Villa Renos.",1
"We spent two nights at this hotel. It has amazing views and the room has everything one would need. There is free wifi and a great breakfast that has at least 3 courses! Visilio, the owner/manager is so incredibly gracious and accommodating and answered any and all questions, printed out boarding passes etc. We wanted for nothing. The location is great, tucked into the side of the cliffs and while another reviewer mentioned it was hard to find, we booked a taxi through the hotel and one of the staff met us and brought us right to the hotel and even carried our bags in. That was very helpful to us. I can't say enough good things about Villa Renos. There are quite a lot of steps, well of course, it's built into the side of the cliffs! So wear good walking shoes.",1
"This boutique hotel lived up to all our expectations. The view from our room was stunning. Great location, close to shops, restaurants. Great attentive staff, charming rooms. The breakfast was wonderful.",1
"We stayed here in late October and really enjoyed it. A bit hard to find in the beginning but we weren't disappointed. It is really central to everything in Fira - shopping, the main street for lots of souvlaki/gyros places, supermarket, etc. - within 5 minute walking distance from all of them. The only thing we had to walk a bit further for were restaurants we wanted to visit as recommended on trip advisor.The 2 gentlemen that run the place are very polite, and we're very welcoming to us. It felt like staying at their own house, really warm atmosphere. They were also extremely helpful with maps, directions & making phone calls for us. Our room was pretty big, had a sea view and balcony (so worth paying for in Fira!), and a king bed. Like the rest of the decor, the bathroom was pretty dated and the hairdryer was pretty useless, but the water pressure was great so it made up for it. The rooms were clean and we had heaps of room to spread out and relax. The breakfasts were really different. You sit down in the dining room near the front desk and they bring a set 3 course breakfast to your table. The combinations of food were a bit strange (bruschetta, spinach pie, apple pie & ice-cream for example!) but it was enjoyable all the same. Was nice not to eat from a huge buffet, and the fresh orange juice was a welcome delight after the store bought stuff at other hotels!We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Renos and would definitely recommend it!",0
"I just returned to the USA after spending three nights at Villa Renos. The accommodations were top drawer, and the staff really rolled out the red carpet for our visit. The breakfasts were unique each day, and provided us with ample fuel for our many excursions. I was very pleased to stay at this hotel, and would highly recommend it to my fellow TA afficianados.",0
"My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon, and I must say our 6-night stay at Villa Renos was our very favorite part. The views from the hotel are STUNNING - when we arrived I could barely believe how beautiful it was. Our room was extremely clean and comfortable and breakfast each morning was out of this world! Vasillis was great for helping us figure out what we should do with our time on the island, but really all of the staff members were warm, fun and very accommodating. We never wanted to leave and are already talking about when we can go back!!!",0
"Villa Renos was one of the highlights of our trip. We were wanting somewhere to relax and just enjoy the time and Villa Renos was the place to do it. The Breakfasts that are prepared fresh from produce grown in the owners garden or sourced locally each morning set you up for the day. The breathtaking views from our room, the friendly people, the great service and the quiet rooms made it a difficult decision each day to venture beyond the balcony. The location between the restaurants and shops ensured that only short excursions had to be made to meet the other demands of the day before heading back to enjoy the sunset. When we return to Santorini this is the only place we would want to stay.",1
"This is THE place to stay in Fira. Ideal location for accessing shops, restaurants and museums in Fira. Ideal setting for lazing on your terrace admiring the perfect dress circle view of the caldera and watching the glorious sunsets. The hotel is run by very nice and friendly people who will do everything to ensure your stay is perfect from smooth airport/ferry transfers to delicious and unusual breakfasts which can be taken on a terrace with magnificent views. Vassilis is very helpful with suggesting itineraries and things to do. If we return to Santorini, there is no other place we would want to stay!",1
"You won't be dissapointed if you book at Villa Renos. The service was friendly and helpful, the accommadation was comfortable and clean and the views from your balcony are to die for. Walk out onto your own private balcony and soak up one of the best veiws in the world from this centrally located villa. There was a small plunge pool to cool off in after lying in the sun and comfortable sun lounges. Breakfast here is a feast and all freshly cooked and served to you as well as extras if you can fit it in! A wonderful place to stay.",1
"This hotel is absolutely stunning. There is no other word to describe it. This hotel is located on the caldera of Fira with the most spectacular views you will find in Santorini. My husband and I sat on our balcony watching the sunset every night. We watched all of the people (tourists) gather along the wall above this hotel to look at the breath-taking views and the sunset, and we felt so blessed and lucky that our balcony was literally facing heaven. We didn't have to line up and stand... it was literally at our front door! I would stay at this hotel over and over again. I recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone heading for Santorini. The owners of the hotel are amazing! Absolutely lovely family! They cater to your every need and want and make you feel like you are part of their family! The breakfast every morning was to die for... Just read every other review... absolutely true :) The location is absolutely perfect. Right in the middle of all the restaurants, shopping, and nightlife. You could not ask for a better location. This hotel is perfect in every way! The only mistake you will be making is not experiencing this hotel once in your life :)",1
"This was our 25th anniversary, and staying at Villa Renos made our dream vacation become a reality. From the first time we spoke with Vassillis on the phone, we were certain this would be the perfect place to spend our time on Santorini, and it was. Vassillis arranged a taxi to pick us up at the Santorini airport, and when we arrived at the top of the hill (to the start of the pedestrian area), his staff was there, waiting for us, to take our luggage. Our room, like all the rooms at Villa Renos, had an unbelievable view of the caldera, and magnificent sunrises and sunsets. We were just one floor down from the main entrance and had a private jacuzzi on our balcony, but we also had access to the hotel pool on the lower floor that overlooked the caldera as well. Every morning the Greek breakfasts were unbelievable! From the variety to the taste and presentation, Villa Renos made the start of every day just perfect! Mama welcomed us and told us about the family history. The hotel was the family home since the early 1900's. The family prided themselves on the quality of their hotel rooms and services. This was the perfect location, with wonderful owners and staff. We would return here without hesitation!   Room Tip: Our room had a fantastic view but was higher up on the cliff, with fewer steps. See more room tips",1
Amazing views from your Baloney. Love the staff. Very helpful with the tour. Breakfast was AMAZING!Sunset here is 10x better than Oia and you have it all to yourself. Will stay here again....but next time will leave our son at home!   Room Tip: the upstairs / downstairs room is great for kids See more room tips,1
"Everything we expected and more. Close to shops and restaurants in Thira. Views of the caldera and the sunsets are enough to keep you coming back. Breakfasts were excellent and Vassillis and his staff were more the helpful.   Room Tip: The very best views from all rooms. Steep steps, but staff only to willing to carry suitcases See more room tips",0
"Had the most wonderful time staying here, back in May. Vassillis & his staff, made us so welcome. The views were amazing! We stayed in the Grand Suite, which was a lovely, traditional cave style accommodation. It had it's own private balcony & spa.Although located down a lot of steps, was definitely worth the exercise! I am quite fit so it didn't bother me. If you don't want to walk down so many steps, there are other rooms closer to the top, equally as lovely, all with fantastic views! The breakfast was amazing, always something different each morning. They used local produce & made a variety of interesting dishes.This is a very centrally located hotel, making it easy to get around the island, being close to transport.I will definitely return to this hotel, outstanding!   Room Tip: If you do not want to/or able to walk down a lot of stairs, ask for a room nearer the top. All have... See more room tips",1
We have always wanted to go to Santorini and this Sept we finally got there. So glad we chose to stay at the Villa Renos - it lived up to its fantastic reputation. We chose to have breakfast there and we are so glad we did. Every morning we got to try delicious food and each day was different- I am a coeliac so to be able to eat a variety of safe food was an unexpected bonus,1
"This hotel in my opinion is the best in Santorini look no were else ..starting from the location,easy walk to buses& taxis ...the view of the caldera is breathtaking ... the breakfast amazing !!! But most importantly the people at Villa Renos are incredibly friendly , warm, helpful and treat you like family!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Santorini !!!!! Thank you",1
"My husband and I came here on our honeymoon and enjoyed everything about the hotel. The view of the caldera is incredible, beds are very comfy and they hand make an incredible breakfast every morning.   Room Tip: Ask for a room with a jacuzzi! See more room tips",0
"We recently spent 6 nights at this lovely family run hotel at the conclusion of a 4 week trip. Perfect location as it was close to restaurants and shopping, but once inside, away from all the hustle and bustle of Fira. The view was spectacular. Room was simple but everything we needed. We appreciated that every morning when we returned to our room after breakfast, the room was made up promptly. Breakfasts were a lovely surprise as each morning we had a different feast laid before us. Although not what we were used to, we did appreciate the care that had gone into the menu and everything was so freshly prepared. A memorable stay and would certainly recommend.   Room Tip: Great views from higher rooms (we were in room1) and only 1 flight of stairs down from reception &am... See more room tips",1
"The Hotel Villa Renos is perfectly situated for STUNNINGLY AMAZING views and within short walking distance to EVERY shop and restaurant in Fira. The staff and owner were very friendly, informative and were very helpful in every manner pertaining to our stay on the beautiful island of Santorini. The breakfast was delicious and the service was both personal and quick. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The biggest difference between the Villa Renos and the other top flight hotels were that the rooms were less expensive....We loved our stay and strongly recommend this hotel!!!",0
"For 35 years I have wanted to visit Santorini. So there was a fair amount of research into finding the most perfect of places to stay. Look no further. Villa Renos is paradise found. From your terrace the magical Calderra and beautiful Agean sea surrounds you. Relax on your balcony as you let the cares of exhausting travel drift away. Breakfast,as has been stated many times, is world class. You will sample dishes cooked by the owners mum, moussaka made with home grown potato and eggplant , traditional mandarin cake, yes desert for breakfast! The rooms and decor are spacious and calming. The staff are all so helpful and very easy to chat with and ask questions of. Local knowledge of the best beaches and restaurants is happily shared. Today is our last day. I just don't want to leave so I know I will have to return. Thank you To the Villa Renos family for an unforgettable stay in magical Sapntorini.",0
"We splurged for 3 days on our honeymoon at the Villa Renos (and certainly not the most expensive place on Santorini, or even in Fira) and we were thrilled we did. The room was amazing (with balcony and private Jacuzzi), the service was impeccable -polite, eager to help, friendly, outgoing), the food was delicious (every morning a fresh breakfast is prepared for you.)It's location is ideal - steps from everything, minutes from the central bus depot, ATV rentals, restaurants, ATM's, and more. Don't be suckered in by the ""need"" to go to Oia for the sunset - the view from Villa Renos is PERFECT and you needn't go anywhere else - although, Oia is a fun town too!   Room Tip: Down first flight of stairs, first room. Was amazing. All rooms are quiet and private. See more room tips",1
"If I couldn't stay at the Hotel Villa Renos I wouldn't go to Santorini. Ever since my daughter discovered it 20 years ago, we've gone many times and with many groups of friends, I have seen that as much as the Matekas family appreciates the beauty surrounding them, so do they respect the visitor in their home. It's not the stupendous view or the lovely accommodations or the fabulous and unique breakfasts that make it special. It's the friendliness, the down-home personal care given to each guest Upon arrival you're treated like their favorite cousin. . . or niece/nephew. . . or old friend or neighbor ! The warmth and helpfulness and humor make Villa Renos a hotel you'll always call 'yours'.",1
"Our travel agent recommended this place to stay for our family of 6 adults. The views on our balcony, mini plunge pools and breakfast were just perfect. For our first time in Greece, Santorini (Thera) was well worth picking out of many islands. Villa Renos was perfectly located, our breakfasts were like three course meals and we felt very looked after in every sense. I would go back in a heartbeat!   Room Tip: You can't go wrong choosing a bedroom here! See more room tips",1
"Villa Renos is smack bang in the middle of Fira, just far enough down the edge of the caldera to offer quiet, but within a minute of restaurants, bars and shops. And of course, a truly stunning view. We just stayed one night en route to our primary accommodation (which was more upmarket). The room was simple but a little bit tired. Breakfast was delicious and slightly unusual (bean stuffed mushroom, fried bread, toast with salmon and cucumber and coffee) and served out on a balcony looking again at the view. Wifi was reliable.Somewhat contrary to some of the reviews we'd read, staff were competent but not overly friendly. We had a room that shared a plunge pool/spa which meant people walked across the front of our balcony. Not ideal for privacy but didn’t cause us any grief. The spa was lovely to sit in and take in the sunset.The hotel had organised transport from the airport for us so we were met there. You can get to within about 300m of the hotel by vehicle and then you walk. Tricky to find since the entrance is on a path leading down the caldera face but we were met at the drop off point and led down.Overall a nice spot, but not overwhelmingly so.",0
"We have just spent 5 nights at this fantastic hotel. The owner and staff were very welcoming and obliging . Nothing was too much trouble.The breakfasts - Well where do I start.In addition to the usual breakfast items they provided a 3 course breakfast plus desert !!!!!. Each day it was different and all the dishes where delicious.The hotel it centrally located in Fira ( close to the transport options buses, taxis and car hire offices ).We would thoroughly recommend any considering coming to Santorini that they consider staying at Villa Renos   Room Tip: We stayed in the Junior Suite which was lovely albeit there was 78 steps to get to it. All the other... See more room tips",0
"Our room was a very simple room overlooking the Caldera. The location to town and view was great. As other people commented, the bed was hard but we were only there for one night and made due. One thing that needs special mention is the people that worked there were fantastic. Incredibly helpful with recommendations and very gracious. The breakfast was one of the best we had during our 2.5 weeks in Greece, including some five star resorts. This is absolutely a five star three star hotel. I hope that makes sense.",0
Loved this hotel and loved it's intimate setting and environment. If u choose to stay at Fira then definitely go for Villa Renos...though be warned that Fira is loud and there are other areas to consider.,0
"The hotel is in a perfect location, close to all of the shops in Fira. It also has the best view of the sunsets, which we watched daily from the private terrace of the Grand Suite. I can't say enough about how fantastic and accommodating the staff is. They helped with recommendations and suggestions for the island. The most surprising part was the delicious daily breakfast. We were expecting a simple buffet but were treated to a multi-course breakfast, different each day and amazing. I would definitely recommend staying here while in Santorini. It's worth noting that there are a lot of steps to reach the Grand Suite back up to the lobby and street but it's in line with walking around Santorini. You also need to be agile to get to the loft bed. Would love to go back again!",0
"We booked Kapari Up & High Suite for the first third of our trip and then after staying one night and falling absolutely in love with the hotel and the staff, we made arrangements to stay the last third of our trip at Kapari, despite already having booked and paid for another five-star honeymoon suite in Oia--yes, we loved the Up & High Suite THAT much! It was so quiet and peaceful, we loved our rooftop pool they kept the perfect temperature, and the staff just waited on us constantly bringing us amazing cocktails and food day and night. Food at Kapari Wine Restaurant was world class, and the wine was incredible! I loved being tucked-away in our ""cave room"" with the most amazing view you could imagine. The suite has beautiful shutters that allow you to black-out the room and sleep until noon on the most heavenly pillows you can imagine; if I hadn't shopped so much I would have tried to buy the pillows from the hotel! I have traveled the world and have yet to stay in a boutique hotel that was so charming--the staff make this hotel a phenomenal experience! P.S. this would make a great honeymoon suite!!",0
"We stayed for 3 days for our honeymoon. We arrived an hour early before check in but they let us check into the room anyway. We were welcomed with complimentary frappes, a bottle of wine, and a fruit plate. The staff were very friendly and gave us outstanding service. The infinity pool and the view were out of this world. The room was a really neat cave house with nice amenities. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for romantic and relaxing time.",0
"We stayed there in June 2016. Kapari Natural Resort is absolutely the most amazing, clean & peaceful place on this earth. The hotel staff are the friendliest group of people & most helpful as well. The food there is so fresh and wonderful that you will never want to leave. I didn't ever want to leave there & I can't wait to go back. Constantine, Dora, Thanasis, Sotiria Ioanna & Yiannis were the best. I will never stay anywhere else in Imerovigli, I will always go back to Kapari for the exceptional service and the most beautiful & natural resort I can ever be in!",0
"I went there around mid July 2016 with my wife and got a suite with a private Jacuzzi. Calm place, welcoming stuff and manager, newly renovated rooms (high technology control for lighting, air conditioning.....) the view over the volcano is amazing and we had one of the best dinners at their restaurant watching the sunset and enjoying the great food. We couldn't imagine going to Santorini and staying in a better and more romantic place",0
"I must say that initially I was only planning to stay in Oia for the four days of our trip but the rooms in Santorini were turning out to be very expensive hence I split the stay between 2 days at Imervogili and 2 days in Oia, I am so glad I did. The hotel is really nice, recently updated and I am sure the prices of this hotel are going to increase next year given the amazing reviews.Check In: Check in was smooth. All over Santorini, you will have your luggage picked up form your taxi/ride and carried to your room and they wont be expecting a tip, although its up to you tip. The reception area is a small office as most of the hotels in Santorini area are small consisting of 12-22 rooms. They gave us a very nice overview of the island and helped us plan some activities.Room: We got upgraded for free to the premium suite and it was really amazing. Not a lot of windows but thats how rooms are in Santorini - they have been transformed from caves to modern day living arrangements. A fruit basket and welcome wine was delivered to us, the rooms were immaculate. Electronic control panels to control climate and lighting. The bathroom is downstairs which was dark and could have used lighter paint like white or beige but they painted the bathrooms black - there is a jacuzzi in the bathroom as well as 3 jacuzzis right outside and above the room.Facilities: There is a small pool which overlooks the Caldera - amazing views. Premium suite comes with a semi private jacuzzi - there are 3 jacuzzis which are supposed to be shared by the three premium room guests. Jacuzzis are small, for two people which makes it very romantic.Breakfast - Cooked to order breakfast and freshly squeezed orange juice. This is ten times better that the average continental breakfast available in the States. You can have your choice of eggs, crepes or pancakes but definitely try the orange juice.Restaurant: Unfortunately I was not able to dine in at the restaurant but it is supposed to be very famous and people from all over the island make reservations and come here. Advanced reservations are highly recommended especially if you want to dine at sunset as the restaurant has extremely limited seating and spectacular view of the Caldera.Service: They service all rooms twice a day and everyone was really helpful. They arranged our taxi to go to the other hotel and carried our luggage all the way up and loaded it in the taxi.Awesome stay, if I ever come back to Santorini - I would definitely stay here.",0
"We have visited some amazing hotels all over the world (including the Maldives) and this has been the best we have ever stayed in! Just everything, the service, the staff, the views, the rooms, the generosity, the food, the cocktails, I couldn't fault one single thing. They even gave us a little gift to give to our daughter who we travelled without, so sweet and thoughtful! I honestly don't know how this hotel isn't at number one! You won't be disappointed if you stay here, so many people have asked us which resort it is from our pics that we have posted online it is that beautiful! Kapari, thanks for the stay of a lifetime! We cannot thank you enough, we will definitely be back! Love Mr and Mrs Bell(Left today) Xx",0
We initially doubt about some aspects of this resort and in the end we realize that the journey and the availability gave by the staff was highly appreciated so our review of this place is super high and we definitely will reconsider this spot if we ever come back to Santorini.,0
"Couldn't of asked for a better stay! The resort service was amazing, every staff member was friendly and helpful. The resort and the rooms are exactly the way they are presented on their website. I have nothing negative to say about my stay at Kapari.",0
"My partner and I just returned from our holiday. We stayed four nights at the Kapari Resort, vanilla room. We had a fantastic time in Greece and if we do come back to Santorini again, we'll definitely stay at the Kapari. We booked the airport transfer with the hotel. Upon arrival at thira airport, the hotel rep was waiting for us at the arrival hall holding a sign with our name on it. We were picked up and transfered to the hotel by a air conditioned mini bus. Approx 25 mins away from airport to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was blown away with the beautiful view of caldera! We were taken to our bedroom 208 which was soooo cute. It was alot smaller than what I expect it to be but it's ok, it's very cute and cosy and I loved it. Our room 208 is a duplex room. Downstairs is the toilet and lounge/living room and the bedroom is upstairs. I know some people have problem with the stairs but I certainly don't. (If you have problem with going up and down the stairs u might want to go for a different room type) As our flight arrived late afternoon, I have booked a table in advance at the hotel restaurant for dinner at 8pm. I heard that the food is amazing at the hotel and the sunset view is spectacular and it is true! The staffs were very friendly and helpful. During our stays, we wanted to hire a quadbike so that we can explore the island. So we went to the reception to find out more. Stefani was at the desk and she was extremely helpful and gave us plenty of advice around the area. She told us there are some dodgy quad bike companies out there and she helped us to booked the quad bike for us which cost around euro 55 per day plus euro 10 for petrol (until 10pm) and also they deliver the quad bike over to the hotel. We had the best time ever exploring santorini with the quad bike! It was so easy and convinient. All u need is a full driving license and some cash. If u don't have cash u can pay by card. The hotel does have a good size swimming pool with the amazing view. Now, there are not many sunbeds (only 8). On our second day, we struggled to find a sunbed to put our bags so we just dumped them on the side and had a quick dip in the pool. On the third day, we managed to secure two sun beds (separately). I have to say, some people are VERY selfish! They only think about themselves! It is a small property please be a bit considerate for others! There were these 4 sunbeds (together) right in front of the pool so there were one couple decided to take the middle two sunbeds and then put their books /beach towels/bag on the side of the sunbed which I think is an absolute joke! They were really taking the piss here! They saw us looking around for sunbed and had no intention of moving their belongings at all! Even tho if they didn't put their belongs on the side of their sunbeds, they shud at least take the two either side, not the middle because it left a odd sunbed on the left and one on the right and they were all really really close to each other. Anyway moving on after the sunbeds (lol), there are other restaurants available outside the hotel which is just a minute walk from the hotel. There's also a shop and cash machine nearby. One issue I had was water. They were complimentary and we had two bottles in the room. However every time after the house keeping has cleaned our room, she never replenish the bottled waters, it happened during my 4 night stays and I have to asked every day for bottled water. It is only a small issue and did not affect my stay at all. Overall, I would highly recommend Kapari Resort to everyone who's looking to travel to santorini. The service is impeccable and I love everything about the Kapari resort!",0
"From the moment we got off the airport transfer, my wife and I were swept away by the Kapari experience: the view from the resort's entrance is simply breathtaking! We were then given a tour of the premise and our room - which was the next surprise: it was the ideal mix of cozy/comfortable with the all-too-familiar Santorini 'cave' decor; yet modern and well-equipped with a central console for in-room and services function. The staff were extremely warm and helpful - never once did they say something couldn't be done - and very proud of their roles in representing Kapari. My wife and I will definitely be returning!",0
Divine. Staff were lovely. View was amazing in our vanilla room. Restaurant was amazing especially the black risotto and the smoked octopus. We never wanted to leave. All the staff were beautiful especially Sortiria (sorry if wrong spelling!). The multigrain croissants were ridiculously good!,0
"My wife and I splurged on Kapari during our honeymoon and we don't regret it. In fact she's already made me promise we'll return! The best part is the location in Imerovigli. You're close to the bigger towns in Fira and Oia but it's much more quiet and peaceful. And oh yea, the views are just as incredible as they look in the pictures! Our room had a semi-private terrace which we loved. We felt like the best view on the island was right outside our front door! The service is incredible as they'll help you get set up with everything, including dinner reservations, renting an ATV, sailing, etc. They're extremely responsive to anything you need. The pool is unbelievably picturesque. It's small but the hotel overall isn't large so it wasn't really an issue. Breakfast is included and it's fantastic. The on-site restaurant is one of the best on the island and great at sunset, just make sure you make a reservation! I'd stay away from the rooms near the pool. This place is made for couples and honeymooners (like most of Santorini) so it's not a good fit for families or rowdy groups. It's the best place we've ever stayed and something we'll never forget.   Room Tip: avoid rooms near pool, go with a room with a terrace See more room tips",0
"From the moment we arrived to Kapari from the airport (on our complimentary pickup from the hotel) we knew we were somewhere really special. This hotel is all about YOU and SERVICE! They have managed to find the kindest most polite and caring hotel staff I have ever come across in my travels. We arrived very late and they had a small dinner prepared for us I case we were hungry and we were starving....they just knew. They whisk us to our gorgeous room which was so clean and comfortable with so much space it felt like our own home for a week. All I can say again is the outgoing service and kindness of the hard working staff from the porters, food service, reception was top notch. The restaurant at the hotel was so good we ate dinner there two nites. It's one of the best restaurants in santorini and it's no surprise. The sunset was a wonderful compliment to our amazing dinners. The reception is so good at arranging anything you need whether it be laundry or arranging a sailing excursion. I don't think there was a request or question that went unanswered or fulfilled. Thank you to every one who works at the Kapari Natural resort for making our trip unforgettable. I can't wait to return. Just a quick mention we had a very early flight and had to leave the hotel at 5am. And even at that odd hour they had a going away breakfast waiting for us on a set table Hot coffee included! That's love",1
"Unreal views. Stunning rooms. Quiet area. Great service. Food is spectacular. If you're visiting Greece please don't miss this hotel, it's a total experice. The food is one me and my man raved about and really felt ewes wee in heaven, I hope to return one day. WiFi could have been better, didn't work well in the pool area.",0
"Kapari is in a fantastic location in the striking cliff top village of Imerivigli. As this is the highest settlement in Santorini, the views are the best - better than Fira town, Firastefani and the much touted Oia. Lovely welcome with generous fruit platter and quality bottle of local wine, fab cave like rooms and friendly courteous service at all times. Dinner on the terrace is a fab setting - would highly recommend the smoked octopus and fav a bean starter! Pricey but most decent places are in Santorini, and the service/location makes it all worthwhile! Easy (but hot!) to walk down to Firastefani and the town which makes coming back to the peace and tranquility of Kapari even more memorable!",0
"Imagine Paradise....it's actually Kapari Natural Resort! Pete and I celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary surrounded by amazing views, the most beautiful staff - always smiling, incomparable luxury, exquisite gourmet dining....breakfast was off the graph! But most of all Kapari brings you calm...we have never felt SO relaxed and SO in love with each other - that's what Kapari does to you, it's impossible not to feel the energy of the island. Sharing this with the new friends we made around the pool was magical. Don't hesitate....if you're looking for the most memorable, romantic holiday ever then Kapari is the only place to choose.   Room Tip: all the rooms are exquisite and individual See more room tips",0
"Can't say enough good things about this place. It is truly magical. The hotel is gorgeous, the views are breathtaking and the staff is top notch. Complimentary, dessert wine, bottle of wine, fruit plate upon arrival, macaroons, etc. we had an early morning ferry prior to when they start serving breakfast and they made it a point to prepare food for us before departure bc they didn't want us leaving on an empty stomach. The rooms are super unique and amazing. All fantastic and different from what I saw. I loved this place so much. Top marks! Def coming back.",0
"My wife and I spent the first 3 nights of our honeymoon here. The only mistake was not staying longer!The room was awesome, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Every evening you had the opportunity to have a sunset dinner overlooking the water - so beautiful.   Room Tip: Stay in room #105 - it's the one that looks like a cave on the inside and has a private outdoor... See more room tips",0
"My wife and I had a FANTASTIC time staying at Kapari while on our honeymoon. The staff was unbelievably attentive, the food was great and the location (between Fira and Oia) was ideal. The rooms were both comfortable and beautiful and, of course, the view is out of this world. We highly recommend Kapari and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Santorini.",0
"We recently had the privilege to stay 3 nights at Kapari and can't recommend enough this resort. It is understandable why it is part of the Unique Lodges of the a World by National Geographic. We were greeted upon arrival by Konstantinos , one of the best hosts we have ever met. He took us to the amazing honeymoon suite and was attentive at all times to make our stay very special. This resort is full of details at every level. The unparallel location provides the best views of the Caldera and the stunning sunsets are breathtaking The staff was among the most authentic, professional and friendly people ever and you can tell they they love for what they do. A special thank you ( excuse if we misspell names) to Soteria , Giovanna, Yanis, Dora , George, Michael and Konstantinus for taking such good care of us. The food is exceptional and the restaurant is ranked #1 in Santorini by Trip Advisor. George, the chef is so talented and creative and will not disappoint the most discerning client. The food was so good that we decided to dine every night at the resort. Breakfast every morning was a treat with a delicious selection of home made bread and pastries, fruits, Greek yogurt and more. We highly recommend visiting this fantastic resort, you will not be disappointed.",0
"We stayed at Kapari for 4 nights. The location and the view was perfect. The service was amazing by all staff, they couldn't do enough for us and we felt very welcome. Our room was serviced and replenished with fresh towels and water 3 times a day most days. The food at the restaurant especially dinner was superb. We will definitely be staying at Kapari next time we visit Santorini.",0
"We stayed at Kapari for a portion of our honeymoon. We chose the Vanilla Suite by how cozy and intimate it looked. The room was a cave style room with everything bathed in white and neutral tones. We had a two level room with our bed up in the loft and below was a sitting area with wet bar and a luxurious bathroom. We had a small sitting area in front that we could look out over the caldera from. A few stairs down was the restaurant area and under that was the communal pool. It was a beautiful infinity pool and while it was small we never felt it was crowded with guests. When you sat out on the loungers the staff would come and bring you cold towellettes and cold fruit to keep you refreshed and hydrated which was a lovely touch. Breakfast each morning was delicious and we found it hard to not eat everything that was to offer! There was a buffet with local fruits, yogurts, breads and cakes and then from the menu you could order eggs and other dishes. The weather was still quite hot when we visited in mid September and used the pool a decent amount and appreciated our cool cave room when temperatures soared at mid day. Lastly, the staff was ever so lovely and professional. From the moment we arrived they made us feel at home and often would offer advice on where to visit and give us little history lessons about the island. I will never forget our stay at Kapari and if we make it back to Santorini we will have to stay again.   Room Tip: Vanilla suite is cozy and romantic. Smelled like vanilla. See more room tips",0
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel and its staff. The staff went above and beyond to make our experience truly special. We arrived extremely early on check in and were treated to breakfast while we waited for our room. The breakfast was amazing, food and service top notch. We ate at the restaurant twice during our stay and the staff made it feel like a true Greek dining experience. The views are amazing and the unique cave-style rooms provide of sense of tranquility that was exactly what we were looking for on our holiday.",0
"What a fantastic hotel. The views are unbeatable; the service great, the food delicious and the rooms comfortable and welcoming. I can't wait to hopefully go back some day! Definitely a top notch hotel in beautiful Santorini.",0
"When one flips through a magazine and sees pictures of the ""dream vacation"", well, this place IS that place. With the nature of my work I travel a LOT, and travel to some very nice hotels, but Kapari surpassed anywhere I have ever been too and in EVERY aspect. I have visited Santorini before, years ago, so was somewhat aware of what to expect, however Kapari is like nothing you guys have ever seen before. Imerovigli is THE PLACE to stay. Away from all the hustle and bustle of the tourists, but close enough to walk to Fira (40 mins, and 15 mins in a taxi to Oia), it is secluded and quite. The room: it was a cave! We booked super last minute, so just chose the cheapest room at the time, and was expecting something smallish (which was ok with us), and when we checked into the room it was HUGE! Basically 3 separate areas, with an amazing large bathroom and a kitchen! The pictures on the website do NOT do it justice! For the less expensive of the rooms, I was shocked at how amazing it was. Normally the cheaper rooms are not as glamorous - this is simply not the case here. (this was room 103). Although not a direct ""sea view"" it didn't matter, the room was breathtaking as it was. Clean, no art, curved warm walls, incredible bath products and so so spacious. We had our own courtyard and private jacuzzi that was meant to be shared with two other rooms, but we did not see anyone else the whole time and had a lovely night dip in the jacuzzi one evening (this overlooking the sea).The food: WOW. You can see why the restaurant at the hotel is rated #1 on the island!!! The breakfast in the morning was lovely and you could order off the menu (no additional cost which some hotels offend charge), and the crepes are amazing btw!The staff: never have I met such nice staff. Everyone always smiling and so accommodating. Calling us by our names each time we spoke, it felt like we were at home. They helped us with EVERYTHING - planning out our day trips, organizing a picnic basket for us for a boat ride, arranging all our transportation and also allowing for a late check out. The customers service here is like nothing I have experienced before. I could go on and on, but instead I will just say, if you are debating booking this hotel in the slightest, JUST DO IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, and rather, it will be a trip of a lifetime, as it was for us. We will most certainly be back. :)",2
"The hotel is as described to their site and even better. No bad surprises, only good ones like welcome drinks and fruit. All staff members are very nice, competent and efficient. We felt very comfortable from the very first minute. Dining in Kapari restaurant was delicious and we repeated the experience. Not cheap but it was what we were looking for and even better. We hope to go back soon.   Room Tip: Improvising is a crowded place, don't expect a very quite or isolated room! See more room tips",0
"we stayed there last year for our honeymoon its the best hotel ever. room is fantastic, Spectacular location away from the hustle and bustle with fantastic views over the Caldera as well the services and the staff (They really made our stay extra special)A magical experience and we can't wait to return!",0
"Beautiful hotel in Santorini. It is not clear from the pictures but you are in the midst of several hotels/apartments built into a cliff. You can be 6 meters away from someone staying at a different hotel. This, though, is quite common throughout Santorini.The views are exquisite and the personal attention is beyond compare. Our room was designed like it was carved out of a cave. Our bathroom had its own hot tub. Great place to relax and unwind.   Room Tip: There really no bad rooms. It just depends on what amenities you want and are willing to pay for. See more room tips",0
"Spectacular location away from the hustle and bustle with fantastic views over the Caldera and skaros Rock. Fira is a 20min walk and the hike to Oia was fantastic. The cave rooms were gorgeous with a large jacuzzi and we were lucky to get a room with a balcony. The staff were absolutely wonderful and no request was too difficult. They really made our stay extra special. Breakfast was a buffet spread as well as freshly cooked items such as omelettes/pancakes etc. We also enjoyed our dinner on the terrace- the ribeye steak with eggplant puree was delicious. It is a wonderful couples retreat and we can't recommend it enough. Marian Niluka Pinto, Perth Australia",0
"We have just returned from a short stay (4 nights) at the wonderful Kapari resort.Before I discuss the merits of the resort, I have to stress that the service provided by the staff was phenomenal throughout. Every request or assistance asked for was provided over and above what was required and with a smile throughout.The room was immaculate and the views of the sea and the rest of the island were the best that I have ever witnessed (including previous holidays to Sri Lanka and Cape Town etc). We also dined at the restaurant on our penultimate evening and this is a genuine MUST DO. The food and drink was incredible.The hotel is well placed within walking distance of Fira and any other excursions are easily organised through the hotel. If we were to recommend anything then it would be the cata maran which extremely fun.A magical experience and we can't wait to return!",0
"Stayed 6 nights at Kapari for our honeymoon end of May, awesome location close enough to everything yet perfect for relaxing in a quieter area! Stunning views and one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Any little issue or question was tended to immediately by the awesome staff. The whole staff is great and very friendly. I look forward to visiting again. Truly a 5 star experience",1
"Probably our best vacations ever! Amazing view and wonderful rooms. Big plus the very friendly staff, dedicated to fulfil all of our wishes. Many special thanks to Mr. Konstantinos Mylonas for his exceptional and unpretentious hospitality! We recommend it with all our heart!",0
"We truly enjoyed our stay at Kapari. We had traveled to Santorini from Paris and Kapari was a welcome respite to the hustle and bustle of a big city. The staff was incredibly helpful and really went out of their way to take care of their guests. Anything you need they'll make it easy for you- car rental, recommendations, private transportation to the airport or port, purchasing ferry tickets...it was all easy and seamless with help from the Kapari staff. Also loved the area of Imerovigli. We saw pretty much all of the island on our visit and were so happy we chose to stay in Imerovigli. Better sunset than Oia (really!), quiet (but not too quiet), and really good restaurants as well.",0
"The Kapari Natural Resort is a stunning hotel and a real must as the service, food and location is amazing. Breakfast which is included was stunning and delicious every day, lots of lovely local and international food. We had dinner in the restaurant twice and we cannot wait to go again, just the best food with a beautiful view, very romantic. The Hotel is a close walk to other great restaurants and of course shops, shopping on the island is fantastic, so if you have not been please go it’s just wonderful, we are certainly going again.   Room Tip: Room 205 is perfect, it has a hot tub a fantastic view and is not the most expensive, its also very... See more room tips",0
"My new husband and I just had an amazing elopement at Kapari this May. I can not say enough about the absolutely wonderful staff. Let me elaborate on staff- each and every person added their personal touch to our experience from the gentleman picking us up from the airport, warm & welcoming reception team, the Manager of the hotel to the restaurant staff! They truly treat you like their favorite family member ;) The accommodations were outstanding and the housekeeping was impeccable. I loved staying in the cave like rooms and our room had a great little loft to sleep in that made our stay just like a tree top adventure! The semi private jacuzzi was great after a day of lots of exploring. Kapari is situated perfectly between the towns of Fira and Oia which gives you opportunities to explore both! Don't worry about going out for breakfast you can't miss the morning view from the hotel restaurants amazing complimentary breakfasts! Our wedding was collaborated with two great ladies (Antonia & Dimitra) that the hotel works with separately but they were equally outstanding all in all I would do it all over in a heartbeat! My husband already said he can't wait to come back! Put this hotel and Santorini on your to do list!",1
"We were met by staff at Aiport and whisked to the beautiful Kapari Natural resort we were taken through a quaint wooden picket fence to a uninterupted view of the caldera we were lead down 93 steps to our poolside room. number (206) we could not of been more happier with our location the interiour of our room consisted of white walls a seperate kitchen fridge stocked with water chocolate and light refreshments . the living area had a inglenook fireplace a extra large bed with a pillow menu as standard . the lights were located by a electronic device with low to high mood lighting and candles .the bathroom had a jacuzzi attached every thing one could want for a peacefull romantic vacation was on offer . the TV had extra movie channels at a extra cost of 10.00 euroes per movie .. the pool is five steps from the bedroom door it was not heated and due to the time of year (may) the water was a little chilly but imagine when the weather gets warmer the pool would be better to take a dip in . the hotel has 14 rooms with a few extra rooms being added somethime this year and you always felt privacy never over crowded we ate in the restaurant most evenings and the menu consisted of to name a fewVerde rissoto, Black Rissotto , porcini Mushroom Tagliatelle, Beetroot RavioliChicken Roulade ,Lamb Rack, Pork Tenderloin, Angus Beef Fillet, Sea bass ,Agean Cod Salmon Fillet, Cheese Pies, Grilled Calmari,Shrimps in Kataifi Crust ,Fresh Tuna Ceviche , the list goes on we sampled most of the menu and the presentation was outstanding the taste delicious..The breakfast was of the same standard traditonal English breakfast or continental with cakes pasteries all made on premisis and delicious. The managment and wating cleaning staff were discreet obliging and always smiling nothing too much trouble our week vacation was blissfull romantic chilling and one we shall always remeber with the fondest of memories . A huge thankyou to all the staff for making our stay a magical experiance To add if you can tear yourself away from the amazing view the Wifi if needed is super fast ....   Room Tip: The rooms by the pool have less stairs to climb See more room tips",0
"I can say without any doubt it was the best hotel of my life so far. It was not cheap, but worth every cent I paid. I was in a honeymoon trip and we chose to give us that luxury gift...and we only have compliments to make. We were very spoiled by all the hotel staff, from check in to check out. Absolutely incredible! Besides the hotel structure, which is excellent. The rooms are amazing, like caves inside the caldera rock. The restaurant is amazing, with a stunning view! We dined there one night and the food was delicious! As the staff knew we were on honeymoon, we gain a custom dessert, heart-shaped. How could we not praise them!?",0
"We have just returned from a 6 night stay in this wonderful hotel.The position of the hotel is magnificent & overlooks the Caldera and many small islands. There is a panoramic view of the whole bay & beyond. The best situated hotel on the coast.The rooms are most unusual & quite large with great bathrooms & great Jacuzzis. Spotlessly maintained by the helpful and delightful staff. The breakfast is very good and the dinner we had was fantastic.The sunsets are amazing, not to be missed.A walk on the cliff way into town takes about 40 minutes with great views and little coffee bars all along.Loved it, loved it..........",0
"We stayed at Kapari for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and had the most wonderful time. The hotel is set on the cliff edge and has the most stunning views from all parts of the hotel. The sunset viewed from here is truly awesome. We were met at the airport and on arrival at the hotel, shown to an upgraded suite, which was beautiful, with a giant bed, indoor jacuzzi, lounge area and kitchenette spotlessly clean and only 5 steps from the pool (I counted !) On arrival we were also given fresh fruit and a bottle of wine as a welcome.The staff are fantastic, polite, friendly and very attentive. Sodiria in the restaurant provided a sumptuous breakfast each morning and remembered what we liked and how we liked it. Dinner in the evenings was of top quality and as good as any restaurant I have been to. Beautiful food. The local wine Assyrtiko is a good drop and very drinkable. The staff helped make our anniversary special by making us a beautiful dessert and putting a bouquet of flowers in our room. A special mention has to go to the cleaners who seemed to have cleaned our room and replaced the towels every time we went out ! The location of the hotel makes it easy to walk in to Thira along the cliff path that meanders through the other hotels, apartments and houses with several pubs and restaurants along the way. We took a boat trip to the volcano as well, which was an excellent day out. At the end of our stay it was very hard to leave after such a fantastic time and we will surely be back ! Thank yo to all at Kapari.   Room Tip: All rooms are excellent See more room tips",0
"We stayed at Kapari for 5 nights in April and it was incredible. The rooms are absolutely beautiful. Clean and well designed. The staff is so very accommodating and warm. They helped us with anything that we needed. We stayed in room 105, which I highly recommend. It's set high up from the footpath and has it's own private jacuzzi and sun deck on the roof. The breakfasts included with the stay were delicious and the restaurant staff were wonderful. The other reviewers are right, they absolutely personalize your stay by remembering your name and even your breakfast/coffee order! I can't say enough great things about Kapari!   Room Tip: Suite 105 is amazing See more room tips",1
"The location of the restaurant is perfect. Beautiful views, amazing sunset.The staff is very friendly and professional and the food is absolutely delicious.You have to go for all the courses because they are all very special !I definitely recommend this place for a lovely romantic dinner.",0
"Everyone knows Oia for the best sunset in Santorini, but personally I found it a little too crowded even had I been there before the peak season. Imerovigli offers a view just as good but way less human traffic for the perfect sunset. I have chosen the Up & High for the view and the jacuzzi to get the most pleasure. The view was simply stunning and as much as I could lay in the waters and enjoy the sunset. Had a little disappointment that the hot water supply had troubles and they couldn't fix it. The delay from one day to nothing at the end sounds to have lacked the perfection of a honeymoon trip. However, I'm still impressed with the way they tried to make up for it. The staffs there had spared every hospitality to ensure us an enjoyable stay.",1
"This place justifies all its great ratings. Beautiful location, pristine rooms, food to die for and a staff whose hospitality is so full of warmth, large heartedness and kindness. I will happily come back here again any day!",0
"My husband and I visited Santorini for our honeymoon and stayed at the Kapari natural resort hotel. We were looked after by the whole team so well, we loved the Greek welcome and the hotel's personal touch. We felt really special and treated like special friends of the hotel. From the welcome at the airport to the goodbyes at the reception the treatment we had was exquisite! When the team found out we were on our honeymoon we were treated to a special cake, the restaurant team were particularly attentive to our dietary requirements and remembered from day 1 how I drank my coffee. We loved it so much that it made our Santorini trip the best trip we have been on. Thank you thank you to all the Kapari family! If we visit again, there is no doubt that we will be staying with you.",0
"This is probably the most beautiful place we've ever been to. The hotel and staff are amazing, very attentive, absolutely nothing is too much trouble. The hotel really is as beautiful as it looks in the pictures. The food in the restaurant is cooked and presented to perfection. Absolutely loved every minute of our stay and would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel.",0
"We had an amazing stay at the Kapari Natural Resort. Besides the spectacular view, and ideal location between Fira and Oia, this small hotel has all elements to relax and unwind. It looks exactly like in the pictures and everything is spotless clean.The service is impeccable. Staff is very friendly, but more importantly, the service is personalized. They remember all guests names, exactly what all guests like, and prefer, and adjust their approach accordingly. Best staff member (in our opinion) is Sotiria who pampers you, remembers exactly what you like for breakfast, is always smiling and talkative, and has a warm personality. We had a suite (room 202) with breathtaking view and direct access to the plunge pool. The hotel is quiet and due to the minimalist design you instantly clear your mind and can focus on resting. The breakfast buffet and a la carte are both divine! Everything is fresh and home baked/made. Also very good coffee. We also had lunch and dinner twice at the Kapari Wine Restaurant. In my opinion the best restaurant in the area. Dinner here also enables you to view the sunset in a much more relaxing way than in Oia where it's pretty crowded.We had a little trouble with climate control in our room and that was immediately resolved as well. Thank you Kapari Natural Resort for an amazing stay!   Room Tip: Suite 202 with direct access to the plunge pool See more room tips",0
"Amazing stay at Kapari. From the arrival to our sad departure every member of staff couldn't have done more to make our stay comfortable. Nothing was too much to ask without being intrusive. Beautiful, very high standard accommodation. We were lucky to be upgraded to room 207 with outside space and an inside jacuzzi. General outside space for sunbathing is limited however this is typical of all the hotels in the area due to their cliff side position and really part of its charm.It's well located, next to the path to Fira which is about a 30 min walk along a beautiful coastal path with amazing views.In addition to the impeccable service the food in the restaurant was outstanding and priced suitably.Our only problem was that the air conditioning had not been switched on as it was unusually hot for this time of year. This was quickly remedied as soon as we raised it as a concern.Overall we would highly recommend and can't wait to return!",0
"The location is perfect, the view insane, the rooms are to die for. Every possible comfort is available to you. The thing that makes this place extra special though is the staff. A great team, always smiling and friendly without crossing the line into being overly familiar who react to every request instantly. I was feeling under the weather during my visit and they went over and above the call of duty to make sure I was OK. Love this place, would wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who wants to visit Santorini!",0
"This place is beautiful! We loved everything about it! The little extra touches make it a very special place to spend your honeymoon. We were given some sandwiches and wine on arrival as it was late and we must be hungry, a fruit platter and wine the next night, just because it was our honeymoon, a loveheart cheesecake the next night and a beautiful loveheart Kapari keepsake on leaving! The staff are wonderful, they are all so helpful...Sotiria is such a lovely lady, we looked forward to talking with her at breakfast...she had travelled more of our own country than we have lol so we got some tips on where to visit on our next weekend off! The rooms are gorgeous! We had our own jacuzzi too! We stepped out right into the pool area and couldn't ask for a better view!Restaurant is the best place we ate in over the course of our stay! So really, Kapari has it all...you don't need to venture out! Thank you so much for making our honeymoon so special!We will definitely be back one day!",2
"The Kapari is one of the most beautiful, relaxing and peaceful places we've ever stayed. It's not just the flawless views of the caldera (which are magnificent), or the beautiful rooms built into the cliff side, or the delicious fresh seafood that makes this place so good, but the service. The entire staff is fantastic. From the moment we arrived, they made a real effort to make this a special holiday for us, without being in any way overbearing. On arrival (having been picked-up by the hotel's driver), we were given a tour of the hotel and some tips for local sightseeing. In the room, they had left a bouquet of flowers, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine - a lovely way to start our honeymoon. The room itself (207) was close to the pool, but still secluded. It's biggest selling point was the terrace with views over the caldera, affording us the most beautiful sunsets each night. The staff even served dinner for us in the room one night; sourcing, cooking and preparing fresh fish especially for us. We spent a lot of time at the hotel just relaxing, and although the pool itself was a little small (and cold!), it was never busy (despite the hotel being full) and has stunning views over the sea. But, the most memorable feature (apart from the staff), was the food. We visited quite a few restaurants in Santorini during our ten days, but the restaurant at Kapari was the best by a mile. The service always attentive, with the food beautifully prepared and presented and an excellent choice of wines. Perhaps the only negative during our stay was the control panel in our room. It's a touchscreen, through which you can control lighting, A/C, hot tub and a few other things. Great idea in theory, but in practice it was really unreliable and difficult to use. The few problems we had, though, were dealt with by the hotel swiftly.We'd highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again and just want to say thank you to everyone at the Kapari who helped make our honeymoon so perfect!   Room Tip: 207 has a private terrace with a beautiful view (and hot tub inside). See more room tips",1
"We have just returned from a four night stay at the beautiful Kapari Natural Resort. The hotel has the most stunning view of the Caldera and sunset. What makes the Kapari stand out is the marvellous service from everyone. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. We stayed in one of the suites overlooking the pool which was excellent. We experienced breakfast, snacks and dinner at the Kapari all of which were beautifully presented and delicious. I am sure we will be back.",2
"We had a wonderful time at Kapari. We stayed at the beautiful premium spa room. The rooms were clean, service was excellent, breakfast spread exceeded our expectations and the view is among the very best in Santorini. The dinner restaurant is also very easy to recommend, great food and great service. I would recommend staying at this resort and exploring the rest of the island on a rented vehicle.",0
"Waw, great place! The view is breathtaking!The accommodation is carved in a rock, looks original and feels very comfortable.The food was fabulous!The staff was very friendly and helpful, blonde withgreen eyes, no greek godesses but better!

"Looking for a romantic getaway? The Santorini cliff side experience you've dreamed of? perhaps both? Kapari fits the bill among a confusing array of choices travelers have in when visiting Santorini.Recommended by friends in Athens we booked an upgraded suite at Kapari to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary. We were beyond surprised by our experience. The room was unique, the views were stunning and the staff was attentive. The cave-like nature of the rooms, which their smooth plaster walls and white decor were the type of accommodation you'd expect in such a stunning location. It was Grecian-Island meets Tatooine...casual w an understated elegance. (No droids) The hotel is located in Irimovigli, a small-ish village at one of the highest points on the caldera. Our room had a stunning view of Scaros, a butte like rock that provides some character to the overwhelming vistas of Santorini. The town is much quieter and IMHO nicer than the more developed Fira and less remote than the charming Oia. Fira is a 20 minute walk downhill and Oia is a pleasant 2 hour hike (or 15 bus/can ride) around the caldera. Your dining options in Irimovigli are limited to hotels and a handful of great local establishments (Avocado & Anogli) breakfast is included and is a generous buffet AND selection of dishes. The pastries are made in house and can't be beat! Our only negative experience was out dinner experience. We had an 8 PM reservation. We were seated and served a welcome glass of champagne. Although the inside dining room only seats about twelve people, we were promptly forgotten. A half hour later w no menus and no follow up we decided to explore other options. To be fair when the hostess later discovered we had left, we received a nice call, apology and offer to come back the next night. But where Kapari excels is in the small touches. A welcome bottle of champagne and array of fresh fruits, surprise cookies(!) and staff the quickly remember your preferences. When we mentioned to our breakfast server, Satoria that we had an early departure, she arranged for breakfast to be delivered to our room at 6:00 AM. She even selected items for us based on her observations of our preferences the days before adding a plate of fresh figs my husband had raved about previously. Brava!The staff also helped us book and at of sailing around the caldera (a must) and was on hand to help w any questions. We were at the lower end of the hotel, by the small pool. It was about 60-70 steps up to the street which is the price you pay for a cliff side room. But hey, it's exercise!With a seemingly endless array of choices, we were glad we took a friends advice and choose Kapari.",1
"My wife and I recently celebrated our 25th anniversary at Kapari Natural Resort in Santorini, Greece. It was one of the top trips we have ever taken. The hotel was very private and quiet and beautifully placed in the cliffs of Santorini. The room was a cave with very comfortable bed and a great bathroom complete with jacuzzi. The view from the room was spectacular. Breakfast was amazing sitting outside staring out at the sea. The staff including Constantina the concierge, as well as the staff were amazing. Extremely available and helpful and friendly, and gave us hugs at end of the trip. They could not do enough for us. Secret about the part of the island where Kapari is located...it is more quiet than the capital (Fiera) and everyone says to visit Oia for sunset, but Oia gets so crowded, that we found the sunset right from our hotel was the best in Santorini. The restaurant in the hotel was fantastic as well. I would give the hotel and its staff the highest rating and would recommend to anyone",4
"What an amazing and unforgettable experience! We knew Kapari was fabulous but had no idea it would exceed all expectations! Our stay was absolutely perfect. First of all, the staff is beyond amazing. The managers Konstantina and Antonis were wonderful and the entire team of staff were all so friendly and accommodating. There was no request too difficult that they couldn't handle. The restaurant staff also deserves a shoutout...One in particular I think her name is Sotiria and she was just the loveliest, with the friendliest smile greeting us every morning at breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, it was fabulous with a variety of options and all hot dishes are cooked once ordered. All this and that view....Kapari gets 5 stars just for its location. Imerovigli is the highest point on the island and Kapari is close to the top guaranteeing the best views of the caldera in all of Santorini, and hence first class seats for views of the spectacular Santorini sunsets. The location is quiet but perfect as the town sits between Oia and Thira which are far busier and their streets get terribly crammed in the evenings as crowds head to either town for sunset views. Think Times Square crowds but in narrow streets around your pool/deck/room. Imerovigli's views must be the locals best kept secret because it has unobstructed views of the sunset without the crowds, making it a truly relaxing and memorable experience. And Kapari is right there at the top.Kapari also deserves 5 stars for their beautiful and well appointed hotel. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and comfortable. We were upgraded to their up & high room (rm 105) which is by far their best room as it is perched at the top with views of the caldera right at your window and has its own private deck with an outdoor jacuzzi, loungers and daybeds for napping. Our favorite part by far was watching the incredible sunset from our private hot tub with a bottle of wine. It is certainly one of the most unforgettable experiences of our lifetime! Having viewed the sunset from another hotel in Oia, I know this is without a doubt the winning spot. Our stay was flawless.   Room Tip: Room 105 is their best room. It is right at the top with a private outdoor jacuzzi with loungers and... See more room tips",2
"Kapari natural Resort is at the highest point of Emirovigli and probably has one of the best view. We were upgraded to a suite that is big, comfortable and has unique features. The staff are nice and friendly. I really appreciate that they accommodated my diet restrictions. This is a beautiful hotel with the best view but I don't recommend this place to anyone with difficulty walking due to the steep stairs. For me, I see it as a work out!   Room Tip: our room is perfect! See more room tips",0
"What can i say that hasn't already been said about 1000 times. Firstly, the staff are incredible! Friendly, attentive, willing to go the extra mile for you. Special mention goes to Sotiria, any luxury hotel in the world would be lucky to have her as an employee, she always went above and beyond to ensure every guests' stay was nothing but perfect. Thank you for that, it is appreciated. Anything you need or want or are unsure of just ask the front desk. They take care of everything from answering questions to booking ATV's for you. The rooms are wow! There's a reason National Geographic listed them as one of the most unique hotels in the world. The view, oh the view. Kapari has the best view on the island, in my opinion. I'm not much of a pool person but it the view made it very difficult to want to leave for the beach. You won't be disappointed staying here, its worth every penny. One note: If outdoor privacy is important to you then you must request a room with a terrace. The rooms by the pool (like ours) walk directly out to the pool and there is absolutely no outdoor privacy. That didn't bother us but if it might bother someone else.",1
"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in! From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty by every member of the staff! Our room was upgraded to top room available (with private jacuzzi pool) making the stay even more memorable. The rooms are unbelievably beautiful and natural with the most magnificent views across the caldera. Breakfast was delicious as was the incredible dinner we had the one night. More so than anything else the service level was impeccable: we had coffees, wine, ice, drinks delivered to our room, the pool etc on an ongoing basis and with a warm smile every time. The Front desk staff - especially Antonis - were so helpful with bookings making the stay in Santorini memorable. Beautiful, quiet location - I can only hope we make it back here in the near future.",0
"After staying in several top luxury hotels around the world, we were armazed with kapari! The view, the size and style of the rooms (only 14), the friendlyness of the staff... Everything makes this a true luxury boutique hotel. An experience to be repeated! I would rank it among the best hotels ever.",0
"Everything was amusing the only two negative aspects that I could mention:- We ask for a quiet room, so the staff gave us a room without jacuzzi, something that appeared on the reservation. The justified saying that as I had requested a quiet room the choice were on a duplex without jacuzzi. But would be nice if they had asked us about it. - The breakfast and lunch was delicious and well served but the dinner ti's overpriced and the portions goes to the other direction...",0
"My wife and I spent three nights at this boutique hotel right on the caldera in Santorini. First of all the view is breathtaking and particularly from their pool. We stayed in a room that was part of a cottage for the resort. Several caveats about the room. Our room was spacious but the door jam to the bathroom is extremely low and i hit my head so beware. Second, the king size bed was on a loft with a steep ladder, if you have any dexterity issues this room is not for you. Also, it was warm during this time and the loft was much warmer than the room. Breakfast every morning is outstanding with a great assortment of foods and they will prepare you hot items upon request. Great view of the caldera. Also, dinner at Kapari is outstanding. The smoked octopus is to die for...Service is outstanding from the front desk to collecting you at airport or taking you to the ferry. Dinner service is equally fantastic, friendly and knowledgable. They can also make recommendations and reservations for others tours like a wine tour which we did and was great and a day at the black beach also equally fun.",0
"All the staffs are very kind and proactive in helping you to arrange everything when you staying in the resort. I reserved Kapari Up & High, with a private terrace & Jacuzzi, staying there to see the sunset are fantastic.",0
"I consider myself lucky I had the opportunity to stay in this beautiful hotel. I do not have much to say since everything was perfect; the room (up & high), the breakfast, the restaurant, the cleanliness, the stuff... Each one of the employees tried their best to make our stay and our experience there unforgetable. Nothing was much trouble for them and they are all descreet and kind. Our privacy was respected and their friendliness was cheering us up every day! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you all!!! We will come back soon.",0
"This is a beautiful hotel with unique rooms and wonderful service. Great quiet location while still feeling in the midst of the action. The breakfast is fabulous. The only down side is the size of the pool - it's tiny and there are only a handful of sunbeds. Overall, I would recommend.",0
"an unbelievable experience. my wife and i went here for our honeymoon in the busiest period of the year, and still managed to feel like we were alone up in the clouds. the resort fosters the feeling of intimacy, and we were truly pampered by the hotel staff. the rooms were spacious and unique, the breakfasts were sumptuous and the hotel amenities were more than adequate. the hotel reserves places for guests at its restaurant to view sunsets so definitely ask for a seat before going - something not to miss!",2
"Staying at the Kapari Natural Resort is not cheap, but the same can be said about numerous hotels/resorts that face Santorini's caldera. What made Kapari special was not just the quality of the accommodation (and it was of high quality), the variety offered at breakfast (a cornucopia of savoury and sweet options) or the quality of the restaurant (make an early reservation to enjoy the magnificent sunset while dining on the island's finest). No, what made Kapari special was the attentiveness of the staff - from recommending local wines to match with your meal to booking a local excursion to ensuring that you always had fresh towels in your room the service was impeccable. I would only deduct points for the smallness of the pool area... But since I can't give half a star, 5 it is.",0
"You can tell from the other reviews that Santorini is a stunning and beautiful island. I'm sure there are lots of great places to stay, but the Kapari Natural Resort was just outstanding.Working in the service industry myself I understand what a difference it makes to customers when you do the little things well. All the staff knew our names, they took an actual interest in us, made excellent recommendations of things to do, made transfers to airport and port easy and hassle free and generally made us feel special. It's so easy to apply detail and make things from great to perfect but staying here was an absolute joy.Santorini is full of great locations. The service you get here will be the difference.",0
"We just came back from this five star cave like resort. It was the best experience for my husband and I during our baby moon period.We were really amazed by relaxing atmosphere, great food and brilliant staff! Special thanks to dear Antonis for the perfect management and lovely Sotiria for a warm welcoming breakfast service and Other staff who made our stay unforgettable.",0
"The most unbelievable holiday destination. The hotel staff could not have been friendlier, the food was spectacular and the room was the definition of comfort! The breakfasts were always a treat and we were sad to leave.",0
"This is our second time staying in Kapari- the team, the location, the amazing interiors.. 10/10. We got married here two years ago. It's like a warm hug from the airport pick up to the airport drop off- excellent hotel. It's relaxing, the amazing service makes you feel like you're part of their little family, and the interiors are all rendered curved white concrete to die for. The showers & bathrooms are all rendered & architectural- It's absolutely a 10/10.",0
"We stayed here on our Honeymoon - so had done the rounds, staying in a number of 5 star hotels and this one blew them all out the water. The service and staff are incredible, to mention the service first in this list is really an accomplishment because the location, views and food are also all outstanding. Make sure to have dinner here but also just across the road is Anogi which is a must try. We stayed in a normal room not the spa room, would like to try a spa room but we got put off my by a few reviews saying the air con is not adequate to cool the spa rooms properly in peak summer so they get a bit hot, the air con in our room was more than capable to turn the room arctic, so would be tempted to try the spa room next.",0
"Built into the mountain, the rooms are cave-like and well furnished. Our room had low ceilings in the bedroom which was raised above the living area. There was a separate area near the front with a Jacuzzi (note: the Jacuzzi's in Santorini are warm, not hot like the USA). The bathroom was also spacious. They have mood lighting in the rooms which makes it even more romantic. The bed and linens were cozy. Our room opened up to a small terrace with a day bed, table, and views of the sea and surrounding Cliffside dwellings. Service was impeccable, they will assist with anything you can imagine. There is a small infinity pool with a few loungers around it. There are two or three rooms that open up to the pool...I wouldn't want one of them. Breakfast is served in a small terrace up from the pool area. We didn't indulge, simply had some of the grab and go fruit etc. Lovely hotel in a great location with amazing views, accommodations and staff.   Room Tip: Pool side rooms are not as private as others. See more room tips",0
"This is definitely one of my best stays in a resort hotel over the years of traveling. As all may be aware that most of the resorts or hotels in Santorini were built on mountains and painted white. Many of them were built like ""ancient cave houses"". I stayed in one of them with Kapari. The room was sophisticated with computerized lightings, air conditioning and TV controls. Spacious and cool amid 40 to 42 degree Celsius in the summer. The view was fantastic and magnificent during breakfast and dinner at its restaurant. Service was impeccable. It should be graded 6 star for its services and view. Price wise, it is abit on the high but trust me, if one decide to visit Santorini, splurge some here and you will not regret the experiences.Thank you all at Kapari.",0
"We stayed at Kapari for 5 glorious days! The hotel is amazing, the employees are the sweetest and willing to help you out with anything, the food is the best! The hotel has housekeeping ninjas that you never see, but your room is always clean with fresh towels. Cannot wait to return!",0
"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful 6 nights stay in Kapari Natural Resort in July. The staff has provided the excellent service during our stay, the breakfast was delicious with a good selection and the location was great - the views were just stunning. If you are lucky enough to visit the beautiful island of Santorini, I highly recommend this little gem hotel !",0
"A beautiful destination in Imerovigli. Amazing pool and atmosphere. We had a great time there, we stayed in a beautiful cave room with view. The hotel is in Imerovigli near Fira the town of Santorini.",0
"You will not be disappointed! The location of the resort itself was perfect. The staff were helpful and friendly. The atmosphere of the resort was intimate and quiet. The room was spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. The views of the caldera and the sunsets facing Oia were breathtaking!",0
This is an amazing hotel with great view over the caldera. The hotel is situated right in a quieter area of Fira which gives you privacy. The small street out front is accessible on foot. Watching the sunset from your very own balcony is magical. Breakfast is also served at the balcony. The room is modern and spacious with a large and beautiful bathroom. The staffs are very attentive and friendly. We will definitely go back to this hotel.,2
"Wow! Amazing boutique hotel!! Prime location!! Amazing service, delicious breakfast and charming feel! So happy we stayed here! We viewed other hotels as we were in Santorini and would definitely stay at Anteliz suites again if we ever go back!!!",2
"My wife and I just stayed at Anteliz at the end of a 6 week honeymoon around Europe. This was our favorite hotel of the entire holiday. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful and provided great service all round. Breakfast was great quality and quantity with a great range of options.The view is spectacular from sunrise through sunset.We stayed in a junior suite which was fantastic. It was higher up which had decent privacy. The bed was really comfy and the bathroom and shower were great.The porters do an amazing job of carrying the heavy bags up and down stairs for you, and wheeling them to the pick up points. The pool area is amazing. So many tourists walking along the path stare in amazement into the gate of the hotel and look like they wished they were staying there.Thank you for the perfect end to our honeymoon!",2
We traveled as family of four (2 boys aged 5 and 9) and stayed in the master suite. The room was very large especially for a European hotel. Two separate rooms and bathrooms. The master room and bathroom were amazing and it was nice to have separate space for the kids. The room has a private balcony where we ate breakfast every morning and enjoyed the sunset views. The room and location were amazing but what sets it apart is the service. This is a small boutique family run hotel where they really care about you. They arranged transfers to and from the ferry and gave us excellent ideas on what to do and booked excursions for us. The owner even drove us to the local hospital when my son was not feeling well. We asked for directions on how to get there but he insisted on taking us and translating if there were language issues. Location is great ... Less than 5 minute walk to heart of Fira. This is far enough to be away from the flock of cruisers that come in and out every day but allows easy access to restaurants and shops. Oia has a reputation for the best sunset views but I found the view from the hotel much better. You overlook the entire Caldera and see it light up in the sunset instead of just 1 side and peering out into the ocean. If you stay here ask about the history of the hotel. It was a converted family owned house and the suite down the street was the grandfathers house. This was very unique and interesting. It would be neat to showcase old pictures and the history to share with the guests. We went as a family but would not hesitate to recommend to honeymooners or couples as it is a small hotel with rooms being very private. I would highly recommend the master suite for a small family too.,1
"This is a small (12 rooms I believe) exclusive boutique hotel, that is located in such a lovelly elveated location with amasing caldera and sunset views.We had one of the rooms with a small pool and we loved the room (202), large bedroom with a nice little terrace outside the bedroom, with a small table, two sun loungers and a small dipping pool (it was glorious to take a dip in the pool on a warm day).The views from the terrace was just amasing, and you had a great sunset view as well.But what made this hotel amasing was the staff, they were so friendly and helpful, and we can't fault the service at all, just great place to stay in.We plan to go back as this is hard to beat, as you feel so well treated.Thanks to all of you in the hotel, we will never forget our stay!   Room Tip: A room with a dipping pool (201 smallest, with 204 being the biggest). 202 was a favorite of ours. See more room tips",1
"I stayed here in July and had a lovely stay. It is a beautiful boutique hotel. The staff are very nice and helpful and the hotel is in a great location, with perfect views of the sunset. I would highly recommend.",1
"Our stay at Anteliz was perfect ! We very much appreciated the pick-up and drop-off from the airport. The location of the hotel was ideal, far enough from the busy Fira Center, but close enough to stroll into the winding streets within 2-3 minutes. Our room was impeccably clean and modern. Though we booked a corner pool-side terrace (no view of the water), it absolutely did not matter. We would swim, rest on the terrace, as well as have a satisfying breakfast looking out on to the Santorini cliffs and volcano. Finally, the view from the hotel was breathtaking. Having walked most of Fira and Oia, it is certainly the best view and an ideal location for the sunset view in Santorini. Thank You so much to the hotel staff for making our stay at Anteliz so memorable and perfect. This hotel is highly recommended.",2
"What a hotel. The view from our room was super. The room and service was super. Breakfast provided on your own private balcony. Did not need to go to Oia to view the sunset as we were able to view from our private hotel balcony. The staff made our stay in Santorini memorable and nothing was ever too hard, no matter what we asked for.   Room Tip: This is a boutique hotel with not too many rooms which made it feel like we were the only family the... See more room tips",2
"Currently staying in Jacuzzi Suite. Jacuzzi good but cold. The staff here are excellent. Friendly. This hotel is in the middle of everything and is gorgeous. BreAkfast to order every morning. Standard stuff. Extravagant stuff abit extra. The path to Firs is in front of the hotel. 8-10 minute walk and the view is one of the top 3 in the world. Indescribable. The suite rooms are medium size . No shower door ..LolThe suites are modern . Eclectic a bit. The staff do alot for you ..They walk you to where you needto go.Tip: email them to have someone pick you up at airport..Lots of shady taxi cabs . People do walk by your suites. Literally. They can look in to your jacuzzi area. Makes for interesting conversation .Stay here if you like Center of Action. Easy access to famous blue dome., Fira town , and excellent service",1
"We would like to thank Eliza, Roberto and Eliza's mum, Maria for helping to make our stay in Santorini so memorable. The service was amazing and everyone was so accommodating. We spent 3 nights during the second week of July and Anteliz Suites was the perfect place for my family. The location is fantastic just a 10 minute walk down the steps to Fira and an easy 8 minute walk to Firostefani along the Caldera stone walking path. There were no steep steps to climb which my husband absolutely loved. The hotel is impeccably clean. We stayed in the senior suite which was a good size for a family of 4. The bathroom was stunning with a fabulous and roomy shower. Each morning, breakfast was served on the beautiful large terrace with breathtaking views overlooking the Caldera. A perfect way to start your day. The hotel pool was a good size for the Caldera and we always seemed to have it to ourselves. We watched the sunset from Oia but the sunset from the hotel is just as stunning and without the crowds. Overall, as the Greeks say, ÔÝëåéá, ôÝëåéá!! (Perfect, perfect!!)",0
"You won't find a better place to stay in Fira than Anteliz Suites. It's a beautiful, boutique, family-owned style hotel. The hotel staff is awesome and so incredibly helpful. (Big shout out to hotel manager Anthony and bell boy Roberto! We love you!) Breakfast is served every morning on the beautiful terrace. I also liked that it was away from a lot of the noise and tourist craziness of Fira.",0
"They position of this hotel is excellent as it is away from the noise of the main resort yet only a 10 minute walk in, the views from the terrace are wonderful. It is a small hotel, breakfast is delivered to your terrace every morning. Although there is no actual bar the staff will bring you whatever you want. This is a great base to see all that Santorini has to offer. We had a great stay here.   Room Tip: The superior rooms were excellent See more room tips",0
"From the start, everything was amazing. The hotel arranged our transfer from the airport which meant that someone from the hotel was able to meet us to take our bags from the square in Firostefani to the hotel (along the cliff-top path).The whole place was astonishing. Our room (Senior Suite) was fabulous and opened up onto the pool, terrace and view. The room went back with the bathroom and shower in a cave which was brilliant.Breakfast on the terrace was amazing - a great basic selection with lots of lovely options which we only managed to try a few.The pool was lovely - not a bad size and we always managed to get in and have it to ourselves as a few of the rooms have private pool facilities meaning not many people share the main pool.Staff were so attentive - from the check-in process to the day-to-day running. We felt so special. It is worth watching the sunset from the terrace - truly spectacular.   Room Tip: The Senior Suite opens out onto the pool and terrace area and is superb, especially the shower!

"Anteliz Suites is an amazing place. It is right in the heart of town, it's within walking distance of many shops and restaurants and very close to the bus stop. The rooms with the private pools looked beautiful but were unavailable.We had a horrible experience with the taxi driver from the airport to the suites, the taxi driver dropped us off 1.5 miles away telling us its right up the road. It was a terrible walk carrying all of our luggage. The hotel told us we could have had a local shop call them to bring porters to help. At the end of the day it was the taxi driver that was rude. We should have hired a private car or told the taxi driver that we were not comfortable with him as he was rude from the get go. The hotel room is nice and comfortable, the view is stunning, the pool was frigid, no one was in it staff was excellent. Breakfast was top notch! We rented an ATV from the hotel and the prices were the same as from the local ATV rentals.",1
"We stayed at Anteliz Suites for 10 days at the beginning of June. We were on the island for a family wedding. What a great location for an outstanding hotel. A short walk into either Fira or Firostafani with picturesque views all the way. The hotel rooms are spacious and spotless with amazing bathrooms. Having breakfast overlooking the sea was a perfect way to start your day. The staff could not be more helpful whether it be putting up an umbrella, serving food and drinks or giving directions. Overall a perfect hotel for a perfect holiday.",2
"We had a delightful stay in Anteliz Suites and felt thoroughly indulged and so lucky to have found our dream accommodation in such a perfect location. Very hard to beat eating breakfast while gazing out over the caldera, unless of course you happen to be enjoying a cold drink while watching the magical sunset every night.I would highly recommend Anteliz to anyone considering a stay in Santorini as we will most certainly be staying there again in the not too distant future.",0
Antelize Suites is a wonderful place to stay. The location is far enough from downtown Fira to be quiet but perfect to walk in either direction and see everything. Our room was huge and beautiful. The pool was very nice and set back a little for privacy. The view of the sunset was magnificent. Breakfast was included and delicious. I highly recommend staying at Antelize Suites.,2
"This was our third visit to this outstanding hotel in Santorini. You can't beat the location. Easy walking distance to both Fira town, Firastefani, and Imerovigli. The view is breathtaking. Beautiful, hearty breakfast each day while looking out over the caldera. Rooms are immaculate and the decor is lovely. The entire staff goes out of their way to accomodate your every need. Anthony and Panos were always available to answer any questions and to provide any advice on restaurants, transportation and sights. We highly recommend this superb hotel when visiting the beautiful island of Santorini.   Room Tip: All the rooms are terrific, depends on what your needs are. This is an intimate hotel. All rooms h... See more room tips",0
"Had a beautiful week at Anteliz. Booked the airport transfer through Anteliz which was the same price as booking a taxi but with the bonus of their guy meeting us at the square to take our luggage and show us the way to our lovely room for the week.Beautiful weather, no mosquitoes and no rain. Booked a private pool room 203 lovely room, nice and cool with beautiful views. The only down side was the people walking past the path they just look in for an instant before the stairs drop down below room level, take a scarf and tie it to the plant to block out the little gap, otherwise it was perfect. Perfect location for strolling into town, great frozen yoghurt 5 min walk away, straight across from cable car station. On way down great shoe shop for ladies just before white shop, beautiful soft leather shoes, Rosa was a great shoe sales woman. Louis,s great for greek salad at lunch further down path past the jewellers street and follow signs down to port (next to Argos) which is also very good for food, we went for dinner at 6pm but was a little hot, better to go a little later when its cooler, great food but no air con. Imeriviliggli is outside Anteliz then turn to right instead of left and keep walking up the hill, beautiful view and nice restaurants at the top (Anogi) on the square is good and always busy but worth the wait or get Anteliz to make reservations before you go. A local taxi is 10 euros to the top (worth it if you're tired). The sunset,s about 8.45pm when we were there, which everyone gathers for. Nothing better than sitting on your patio on Anteliz with a glass of local vino and watching it at your own pace, then going for dinner later. everyone eats late in Santorini. Lovely local restaurant 5 min walk from hotel, to the right Aktaion, small but lovely, local prices. To be honest we found all the restaurants to be very reasonable, we ate at and food quality was excellent and fresh. We went on sunset sailing trip with thalassa (great) food included and wine, just need your own towel and money for water and extra drinks if required (this included the volcano walk) and sailed to Oia with jazz music, take your trainers to walk the volcano. Its quite easy, take your own pace, bottle of water and a hat, coverup and walk up the path with the guide. We also went on the wine tour which was quite good but last time we were here we got the local bus to santo winery and enjoyed that as well. (The wine flight at Santo was really reasonable). Santorini was just as beautiful, Anteliz was an absolute treat to come back to after every outing, spotless clean and if you required anything the team were on hand to help. Very well run and beautifully done. Santorini is the kind of place, you arrive, see the view, breath out and then relax for the time you're there. Thanks Anteliz team x   Room Tip: pool suites See more room tips",1
"This hotel certainly has the wow factor. Beautiful hotel superbly run by Elizabeth, Anthony and Panos. It is truly home from home and nothing is too much trouble. Breathtaking views and spotlessly clean in the bedrooms and all around this beautiful boutique hotel. I was so sad to leave and wouldn't hesitate in booking this gem of a hotel again. Everyone was so helpful in organising any trips, restaurant bookings and they were extremely knowledgable about santorini which is such a beautiful island.",1
"Amazing hotel. Very romantic and beautiful spot. The views are emasculate and one of the best locations in Fira / Santorini. Would highly recommend the junior suites. We came for our honeymoon and it was everything we expected and more. The family that runs the place is very lovely and so accommodating. The staff that help with the bags, and then with breakfast including the man that does the evening shift until close are very friendly and polite and so attentive. I can't find a fault. I would definitely recommend this lovely family owned hotel with speculator views of the caldera, great breakfast, lovely staff, great location in Fira and great facilities. I wish we could have stayed longer!",1
"Spent 3 nights at Anteliz during first week of July of 2016 and in short the place is outstanding, what a great experience it was. Here is why: 1- Great location: right on the edge of town center (Fira), where you get privacy and quiet when you need to rest, but a few minute walk to restaurants and shops. 2- Excellent service and super friendly staff. A big shout-out to Anthony and Panos – thank you both for making our visit fun and pleasant. 3- Well maintained and VERY clean, the room, the sheets, the bathrooms, the pool… everything. 4- You just cannot find better views anywhere.The master suite was spectacular in terms of cleanliness, authentic decor (with a modern touch) and size.   Room Tip: Make sure you try the breakfast there... by the pool. See more room tips",1
"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon, and had one of the private pool rooms. It was an incredible experience. Beautiful view of the sunset and the sea. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. They arranged every excursion we asked for through their office to save us the trouble. They even set up a fishing trip for us, something they do not typically do but went through the extra trouble just because we asked. We did the standard breakfast each morning and it was delicious. They set up a romantic table by the pool so you can watch the sunrise each morning. It was great. I highly recommend this hotel.",1
"So first off, the staff in this hotel are super friendly and helpful. They emailed us before our arrival making sure that we were all sorted for our porter collecting us to take our luggage to our room down the short but fairly difficult (with bags) route.The room was amazing, beautifully decorated and clean. The private pool and deck was also perfect; except for one minor detail....the main, and very busy path to Thira was at the back of the deck. The height of the wall is obviously designed to make sure you get the most of the perfect scenery. However, due to the height of the path at the back, it also means there is a constant trail of heads bobbing past your back deck and having a good gander in whilst you're relaxing in the pool etc. They also had a tendency to stop outside the deck to watch the sunset, stopping us from being able to see it properly. Having said this I would certainly return, perhaps ask for the rooms more towards the left hand side when looking out to sea since they seemed a bit more private. The rest of our stay was perfect!",1
"Stayed at a junior suite, definitely pricey but it was worth it. Good service at the front desk, very accommodating. Small hotel so not too crowded. Beautiful views of the Caldera and relatively central to visit north and south of the island. Room design is great and spacious.",1
"I recently visited the Anteliz Suites on my honeymoon in June 2016. The hotel is absolutely stunning, the views are breath taking and the suites are so beautiful! My highlights definitely have to be the views from the hotel, the bathroom and rooms! It is a must stay and my husband and I will most certainly be going back. The staff were wonderful and so welcoming, always willing to help make our stay perfect!",2
"We picked this place on hotel.com and i wasn't expecting much but i was so wrong. Anthony (i think his family runs the place) at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly. The location is great, the staff comes and meets you at the drop off location (5 min walk to the hotel) and they take your bags for you. Once you get to the hotel they greet you and show you to your room (rooms are big, clean, and cozy and the bathrooms are awesome) breakfast was amazing with breathtaking views. Staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel is quite with a cute pool (other rooms have private small pools) but we didn't stay in one.I would totally recommend couples and families to stay here, i know if I'm ever back in Santorini this would be my 1st option.The staff is also super helpful at renting atvs, recommending and making restaurant reservations as well as tours",1
"We just spent 4 amazing nights at Anteliz Suites with our adult children and could not fault this beautiful hotel. The rooms and facilities were immaculate, every member of staff was welcoming and helpful, and the location was great. Anthony and his sister Elizabeth are amazing hosts and were full of advice and information. The sunsets from the hotel are just as beautiful as anywhere else on the island. If we could give this hotel a higher rating we would. Do not look any further. Anteliz will not disappoint.",2
"All aspects of this hotel are perfect. Staff went above and beyond to make our stay amazing. Bathrooms are best I have ever seen and breakfast was delicious. About a 10 min walk to town, although positioned high which translates to great view. Highly recommended!",2
Wow what a beautiful Hotel could not believe how beautiful it was in Fira Santorini from the minute we arrived Anthony could not do enough for us staff all friendly and the view over the Caldrea awesome would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting 5 star all the way breaky yummy as well Thankyou Peter & Sharyn  Australia,1
"Anthony and his sister make you feel so taken care of, without being at all overbearing. The location couldn't be more perfect. Central on the island. Two minute walk from central Fira. But extremely quiet with unbeatable views. Comfortable rooms, great breakfast, friendly staff. A literal perfect place. I've just left today and have already recommended it to my parents and a friend. I will definitely be back.",1
"Anteliz Suites stand on the edge of Thira, overlooking the caldera bay. Absolutely stunning views ans sunsets. The apartment we had was furnished to a very high standard, even though it was not at the luxury end of their range of rooms. The pool was stunning with direct views over the bay and to neighbouring Thirassia. Panos and Anthony were particularly helpful and attentive hosts. Breakfast is served poolside with 'that view' as the backdrop. A short walk along the cliff top brings you into the bustling town of Thira with its wide range of restaurants, shops and bars. It's easy to get a bus locally to the picturesque hilltop town of Oia or to beaches on the other side of the island. If you are looking for a little luxury on Santorini look no further.   Room Tip: There are rooms with their own private pools if you want to splash out on luxury See more room tips",2
"We arrived here, hot and bothered, in the evening, to be greeted with a glass of wine and a lovely cool glass of water. At that point we knew we had made a great decision staying here.From then on we could not fault the hotel. For the first 3 nights we stayed in a senior suite, which was a great size, efficient air con, and with a comfortable bed and lovely walk in shower.On our last night we moved to a room with a private pool. Again, this was a wonderful experience.We had lunch on the terrace a couple of times, which was nice and tasty.In all areas the cleanliness was spotless - a sign of a well run establishment.Finally - the staff. It is rare that you find every member of staff as friendly and helpful as we did throughout our stay. We were made to feel welcome, and it really made our holiday.You rarely find that the pictures on a web site accurately reflect what you find on arrival, but I can honestly say that what we saw was what we found.A brilliant find, and we will definitely return soon.",3
"It’s a gorgeous place to stay. Staff immediately makes you feel comfortable and you feel so at home. You are pampered from the time you reach the hotel. The room that I was staying had an character and had a feel of a house with beautiful decor. The view from the hotel is gorgeous. Breakfast is just yum...especially the home made marmalade.... Since I was travelling alone, special thanks to Anthony for making my trip so beautiful and safe.",1
"This was a beautiful hotel and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we were happy and comfortable. The pool area was lovely and the view is breathtaking. The hotel is a very short walk to all of the bustle of Fira, but far enough that the cruise ship traffic didn't venture over. The sunset here is stunning! Breakfast was fantastic! Staff was always cheerful and very helpful! We really enjoyed our stay.",4
"Stayed in the junior suite.Pros:-it's only a short, scenic walk away from the city centre and all the restaurants-flawlessly clean-relatively large pool-great photo set! Cons:-slightly on the expensive side but that's the price for a hotel that ticks all the boxes",3
"We rented a Beautiful pool suite with a breathtaking unobstructed view out onto the caldera. Anteliz is maintained to a very high standard and the small intimate complex was immaculate. The staff were very attentive, onhand and helpful whenever we required yet they left you with plenty peace and privacy to enjoy the suite and views. The location was just perfect for us.. nice and peaceful yet just a 5-7 minute stroll along the cliff top to the edge of the Fira for all its hustle and bustle of bars, shops and restaurants. There is a steady stream of tourists wandering along the path just beneath the pool suites but to be fair most of them were looking out onto the caldera too and couldn't look directly into the suites. A real luxurious feeling holiday spot, but then it should feel special for the prices charged.",2
"My friend and I stayed in a private pool room at Anteliz Suites. The entire property is beautiful, as was our room and terrace. People stop by to look at the hotel and private pools, which makes you feel like you chose the right place to the stay. The staff was wonderful with arranging a transfer service, assisting us with our bags, greeting us with wine, arranging ATVs, and just informing us about the island and things to do and places to eat. Be sure to call to request your breakfast is served in your room. This place felt like pure luxury, and the best were comfortable. After long, hot days exploring the island, having the private pool to come back take a dip was wonderful. The common pool was beautiful as well. Definitely stay here for wonderful views, luxury, and service. Thank you for a great stay!",0
"We stayed five nights at Anteliz suites. We had a wonderful time. Our suite was very comfortable and included a deck with fabulous view. The staff, especially Panos, was outstanding. Panos gave us a good overview of the island with options to keep us busy. Panos also helped with restaurant recommendations and reservations. One tip: be sure and have the hotel make airport transfer arrangements.",0
"If staying in Fira the Anteliz is the place to go. A wonderful location with great views, attentive staff, well laid out rooms and a great breakfast served poolside on the patio. The number of people who just stopped by the hotel to admire it and take photos specifically with the hotel as a backdrop while walking by speaks volumes - it's very picturesque with a fantastic layout. Central location is also ideal with short walks to Firastefani and the shops and nightlife of Fira.   Room Tip: We had a superior double which was a good size and appeared much nicer than regular doubles. See more room tips",1
"Lovely position and accommodation, beautifully clean and maintained.Our room with private pool could not have been better and with such a wow view.The staff were very helpful and everything was catered for.Breakfast served on the terrace overlooking the Caldera was a great way to start to the day.I would recommend The Anteliz Suites without hesitation!!",0
"My wife and I have just returned from a week staying at this fabulous place. we booked a junior suite and awoke each morning to probably one of the best views in the world with breakfast on our terrace as a bonus, the room was spotless with a large comfortable bed and a lovely walk in shower with copious amounts of hot water.We found all of the staff went out of their way to ensure your stay was as good as it could possibly be, they even found us a kettle to make our own drinks as we do tend to drink a fair amount of coffee.We used the pool terrace on a couple of occasions and the staff will serve you drinks if you request, always with a smile, special thanks to Jimmy and Roberto for that.As has been mentioned in many previous reviews about Anteliz, almost everyone who walks past on the caldera cliff top path stops to take photos and selfies through the gate that opens up onto the pool terrace, such is its appeal.If you are thinking of treating yourselves to a trip to Santorini have a good look at this place, I am sure you will not be disappointed and with the bonus of a fantastic sunset view thrown in for free.",3
"We had our wedding at Santorini this May. All of our guests and us were staying at Anteliz Suites, which was an amazing experience. The view was absolutely stunning overseeing the caldera ( I would say it is one of the hotels with the best view).The design of the room is very unique with a combination of modern and traditional greek look. Not to mention, the staff at the hotel was extremely nice. They helped coordinate all of our guests to check in, arrange transportation to the airport, and very patiently addressed any questions we may have. On the day of departure, They even called the ferry company for us to confirm if our boat was still leaving on-time because of the strike.We will definitely come back for another time.",2
"I can't say enough about this place. It's in an absolutely perfect location - close enough to Fira to walk down for dinner but really closer to Firostefani, and thus insulated from the hordes of cruise ship passengers who debarked every day. It's also more convenient to the airport and black sand beaches on the east side of the island than Is Oia or Imirovigli. And the view of the Caldera and sunsets is spectacular. It's also a beautifully built and maintained property, with white marble everywhere, wrought iron gates, and gorgeous rooms and pool suites. Breakfast is included, and there can't be a better place to have one's breakfast every morning than overlooking the azure Aegean Sea. Wifi is free too.But what's best is the staff, led by Anthony. Everyone was welcoming and helpful in every way, and made us feel like we were living in our own private seaside villa on the cliffs. I give Anteliz my absolute highest recommendation.Two tips: (1) Walk up for dinner to Firostefani, where there are several excellent restaurants, including Remvi and Mama Thira, with mind-bogglingly gorgeous views at sunset. Not only do you avoid the crowded feeling of Fira, but your walk after a bacchanalian dinner is downhill, not uphill. (2) Take the bus from Anteliz up to Oia and down to the black sand beaches. The bus costs just €1.80 (versus €35-40 for a cab) and is a modern, air-conditioned and comfortable bus.",2
"The best part of Anteliz Suites is the view- it is in the perfect position of the caldera to see everything. We stayed in another hotel in Santorini as well and the view was not nearly as good. While we loved the design of the bathroom (like a cave), the hot water didn't last long. The wi-fi was not good at all and didn't always work in our room. If you're someone who cannot eat bread, the breakfast is a bit small. On the whole, we loved our stay there and would definitely recommend it based on the location alone.",0
"This is a beautiful hotel...Great staff..Great service..Great breakfast...Everything is 10 star..What a setting. ...Cold beer watching the sunsets...Thanks to all the staff for looking after us so well..From Panos,Elisabeth,Anthony,Roberto and Jimmy and anyone I forgotO",0
"I paid a lot to stay here so I had really high expectations, specially from the reviews here. The hotel is very hard to get to from Fira.... Do not plan on walking your luggage here.The receptionist was very grumpy and rude , he made us feel very uncomfortable when being around him or asking him any questions about our stay. The room we had , even though we got one with a pool was not functioning properly. Lots of lights not working, spa was not heated... Had lots of noise from the main walkway outside. Breakfast was terrible and nothing special, omelette was cold.The porters was the only one I felt worked hard to make the customers happy.Not sure how this hotel ranked up higher but if you still book this hotel after reading this... Just remember that I warned you.",3
"Great spot, amazing volcano view, infinity private swimming pool, fantastic breakfast and very helpful staff! Rooms combine a traditional Santorinian style with all modern facilities. Enjoying the perfect sunset from your balcony is an experience you never forget.Definitely one of the best places to stay in Santorini..",1
The hotel is one of the best we have stayed at. The room were the biggest and the best layed out I have ever stayed in and the food/breakfast was great.Everyone in the hotel was also very helpful and always deal with a smile. FANTASTIC VIEW and only 10min walk to central Fira. I am glad that I spent my holiday here.There was nothing to complain.Thank you for making our stay truly amazing!!!,1
"This was the perfect place for staying on Santorini. The view of the caldera from the room is amazing. The room was new, modern, clean, and roomy. The staff and owners were sweet and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. The location was great - you're close to the restaurants and shops of Fira and Firostefani without the noise and crowds. After four days on Santorini we never saw a better place. Breakfast on the terrace patio was so good, along with the views, that we were never tempted to go elsewhere. -- Bed was very comfortable. Wi-Fi was good. -- Be aware that our room was on the lower level (with a private tub) which was next to the cliffside trail so you have some people walking by. Not a big deal and almost everyone passing by has their eyes glued to the view. In fact, the occasional overheard ""wow"" made us chuckle as we got to re-appreciate our room. If we ever go back to Santorino we're staying here!",0
"Great place, staff and location. The best thing about the place location its conider to be far from shops noise so you can enjoy the view and the moment but not far walking distance. Definitely i will recommended it to my friends.",1
"Fantastic place with a great view, generous common area, staff and only a 5-10 min walk to central Fira. Definitely the most beautiful hotel we saw in fira. The Bfast was served on out terrace and very good but possibly not as extensive as other bfasts we had had in Greece. Overall thoroughly recommend",1
The pictures that you see with this hotel are all real. Could not believe the awesome view from our room. We had a room on the top level and would eat breakfast on the deck over looking the Aegean Sea. We paid the hotel to be picked up at the airport when we can in and to be dropped off at the port to go to the next Island. Everyone at the hotel was very accommodating to us. Shopping was very close to the hotel and great restaurants. I would recommend Salt & Pepper and Mama's House great places to eat.,1
"We had some troubles finding the hotel initially but Anthony picked us up and turns out we were only about four doors down from the hotel ( less than 5 min walk). If your coming in from the port there is a bus to Fira for just a few dollars per person. Be sure to take a taxi ($8) from the bus stop they will drop you off between Fira and firostefani. Take the left side road and continue walking for I would say 10 minutes( with luggage) to reach the hotel. Since we were there during the start of the season it wasent crowded at all. I even think at one point we were the only ones in the hotel. Anthony, Elizabeth, and Panos were fantastic! We stayed for three nights only April 17-20 on the pool suite. The pool was freezing cold but was great to jump in after a hot day such as hiking from Fira to Oia. The view from the pool suite is unforgettable especially when you open up all the doors and windows for the fresh air to come in. Every morning we had breakfast sent to the room where they bring a tablecloth and set up each plate beautifully. Their homemade marmalade is to die for! This is best part of our three island hop. Helpful tip: since the pool suites are fairly new and your key doesn't seem to open the door pull the door and turn the key left all the way until hear the door unlock. Thank you Panos for helping us. Overall fantastic trip and I hope to return one day! I cannot say thank you enough! -SN",3
"The room was spotless, the views beautiful, and the staff extremely kind and courteous! Location is close to shopping and dining in the village of Fira. Gorgeous sunsets from the patio was a great way to relax. Highly recommended!!!",2
"What a memorable experience. One the best views, best rooms, best stays I have had in Europe. The staff are especially beautiful, which makes it all the more memorable. A must you want the best stays when in Fira.   Room Tip: Best Views if you have a pool suite. See more room tips",5
gosh what a trip with my husband for our honeymoon it was a delight stay thank you for an amazing honeymoon Greece I advise everyone who is wanting a relaxing honeymoon please have a look at this hotel.   Room Tip: chose the best view See more room tips,2
"Stayed with Anteliz Suites for 4 Nights in Mid October, although it was a spurlge, it worth every penny!We arranged airport shuttle to pick us up from the airport. The hotel was located between village Firostefani and Fira. It has the perfect view of the caldera and Aegen Sea, 10 mins scenic steps to the bustling Fira town, and yet you get to enjoy the tranquility at night. There is a short walk from the shuttle drop off point, but hotel staff had awaited us to take our luggages. Not to forget to mention that the little greek restaurant –Aktoin round the corner which is a must try.We stayed in the private suite with pool with the breathtaking view overlooking the caldera. The private suite is not completely enclosed as there are noises from tourists passing through the foot path in front or stopping over to take picture. This however did not impose any inconvenience to us. There were good selection of breakfast and the staff can either brought to our room at our preferred time or we could asked to dine at the open dining next. Being in your room or outdoor, we got to adore the view every morning while enjoying the breakfast. The room was very spacious, came with free wifi, Bluetooth speaker. The bathroom was also beautifully decorated and looked posh. The bed was so comfortable.There were lots of things you can do in this island. Anteliz Suites is the great base to embark everyday itinerary. We went hiking on the 2nd day, joined the sailing tour on 3rd day, and rented a Smart car through the hotel on the 4th day round the island. There are few carparks nearby to the hotel so no worry where to park the hired car.There is nothing to fault about this hotel. First, I must say thanks to the staff who served us breakfast every morning. They were both so polite and hardworking; 2nd thanks to the housekeeping ladies who kept the room , the hotel surrounding so tidy and clean; Thirdly, the front desk guys were helpful to make any booking you require and provide you guidance. If I was asked to give comment, probably I would suggest a kettle in the room would be ideal so that we could make ourselves a hot drink at night while sitting by the patio as the front desk guys weren’t there 24 hours, though there is an emergency number to ring.If I were to come back Santorini again, Anteliz is surely my choice again.",6
"This place cannot be described in words.I did not had a chance to write a review earlier for our stay but thought it was necessary.This hotel is in such an amazing location, rooms are great, service is great and so accommodating.We even got a free upgrade. Do not stay anywhere else ! This place is heaven.",2
"We visited Santorini in June 2015 and we booked the Anteliz Suites for a week, I was looking for somewhere special to take my partner as it was her 50th birthday, well it was amazing, the views were amazing and the Suites gorgeous with a pool to cool off in also. Our hosts couldn't do enough for us and the waiters would bring our breakfast up onto our balcony ever morning they were just brilliant. There were so many places to eat and drink in the evenings, don't miss the sunset in Oia, gets really busy though. Only one downside if you have trouble getting about is steps everywhere, but overall fantastic holiday thoroughly recommend it, Anteliz Suites Awesome",2
We had a most enjoyable stay. We stayed with our adult daughter and her boyfriend who arrived early and were upgraded to a junior suite and they thought they were in heaven. When we arrived later at the airport we got a shuttle bus that went to our hotel and the bus driver rang Anteliz Suites so somebody was waiting to take our cases on a big wheeled trolley. We were so glad as the path leading to the hotel was quite rough as it was made out what looked volcanic rock. Once we arrived the view was magnificent. The staff were very friendly and gave us a glass of wine whilst we booked in. Our room was very nice too. The breakfast in the morning was very good too with plenty of choice. The staff were terrific and helped us with our cases when moving on to a villa nearby. Highly recommend.,1

"Stayed here for 3 nights in early October 2015. The place is flat out gorgeous. The rooms are spacious, the breakfast large and delicious and the views breathtaking.To sit out by the pool overlooking the caldera at sunset is one of life's great experiences.The hotel staff are very friendly and eager to help with great dining suggestions, how to get around the island and whatever you need to make your stay on Santorini memorable.",7
We visited Santorini in late season and picked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were not disappointed. It truly is a very special location on the Caldera with fantastic views. Room we stayed in was beautiful and my guess would be that all rooms are of a high quality. We particularly enjoyed breakfast on the terrace with spectacular views every morning. My family and I cannot say enough about the team running the hotel - they were very helpful and took great care of us.,2
We stayed for 4 nights in October and absolutely loved it. The staff are friendly and the breakfast is large and good. They serve it overlooking the ocean. The room we stayed in was huge and had a spa and a large bathroom. It was very good quality and we would definitely stay here again. Everyone walking past kept stopping and taking photos of the hotel and the views from our front door.,0
Santorini is heavenly!!!!! This hotel was everything beyond my expectation. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful who truly go out of there way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. My husband got sick with a sinus infection as soon as we landed in Greece. I called the front desk to figure out where to take my husband and how to get there. I believe his name was Antonio (at the front desk) he himself took us to the hospital and assured us the service was good. He was right and for that we are very thankful. Now back to the hotel.....We had a suite with a pool and I can't tell you how spotless everything was. The view from our balcony was like a dream I will never forget it. We enjoyed our breakfast on the patio by our pool and looking at the cruise ships. I must say the sunsets are hands down the best from this hotel than any other location we ventured to. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Santorini. Its an excellent location looking forward to returning again.   Room Tip: Room with a pool is amazing See more room tips,5
"Santorini was a DREAM! This small hotel is a huge part of that dream. The two gentleman that run the hotel are truly outstanding. There is nothing they won't do for you, help you with ... always asking how you are, if you need anything. They arranged excursions for us and made it all so simple. They even arranged to have a 4-wheeler brought to the alley nearest the hotel for us so we didn't have to go to one of the local shops to pick one up. Breakfast every morning was delicious and always prompt. Eating breakfast on your own private patio with this view is phenomenal. We stayed 4 nights in a room with our own private pool and I would absolutely recommend that. It meant we had our own private place to eat breakfast outdoors and had the benefit of the pool. Note - the pools are not heated - not those in the rooms nor the main pool of the hotel. The water is pretty cold, but we still got in and used it regularly in the middle of October. Our room was beautiful and the servicing of the room every day was impeccable. Have already recommended this hotel will many people and will absolutely stay here on our next visit to Santorini. Agree with other reviews that the sunsets from this hotel are better than anywhere else! I loved the windows and doors to our room - you could open for sunlight, crack open for a breeze or open fully - they are cool. Hotel offers free wifi and rooms do have small safes.   Room Tip: Get one of the rooms with it's own pool See more room tips",2
"We stayed here for a portion of our honeymoon and I don't know what else to say besides that it was amazing. One of the most relaxing stays I have ever had, anywhere. They arranged anything you asked for- dinner reservations, yacht tours etc. Front desk guys (and actually everyone) were so helpful. Every person that walked past the hotel stopped for pictures because it is that beautiful. Will be back for sure!",1
"As with most reviews for this hotel - we can not fault it at all. It is an amazing place to stay. The rooms were spotless, spacious and we had a lovely bathroom. The staff were friendly and they couldn't do enough for us. Each and every person who worked at the hotel made our stay something that we shall never forget. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Santorini.",1
"We loved the beautiful and relaxing outdoor setting, perfect location and excellent staff of Anteliz Suites. A magnificent overview of the caldera can be enjoyed at breakfast tables on the terrace. Breakfasts are outstanding! Guests can select from a menu that includes fluffy scrambled eggs or boiled eggs, orange and other juices, fresh fruit salad, the most delicious yoghurt with honey, cereals, fresh breads, etc. The managers, Anthony and Panos, were both exceptionally helpful with planning our time, reserving bus and boat tours and suggesting excellent, moderately-priced restaurants. The wait staff, Idi and Jim, who cheerfully hauled our bags the 10-minute walk from Firostefani Center and served breakfast, were friendly, helpful and attentive. The hotel sits by the rim of the caldera next to and above the stone walking path that connects Fira town with Firostefani, both about a 10 minute walk. Away from the heart of lively Fira town, the nights are quiet and peaceful. The Classic Double room is comfortable and overlooks the elegant pool/decking/terrace, and though it does not have a balcony, the dramatic view of the sea from the breakfast tables is comparable to the balcony view. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!",1
"Arriving Fira at 8pm, I had Anteliz hotel arranged our airport pick up to their hotel. Dmitri came to greet us, and carried our bags through the pedestrian alley linking Firostefani to Fira. I remembered feeling in awe looking at twinkling lights from houses built on top of the cliff surrounded the caldera. Arriving at the hotel, we were very pleased with the hotel view and the hospitality of the owner. We got our room; it is facing the pool and the bathroom is a cave like room, very Santorini style. From some travel moments we adore, this hotel has one of them; VIEW --beautiful caldera view from the breakfast table and beautiful sunset glow with hotel pool lit up in front of you.",1
"We have never stayed at a more beautiful hotel! The service was INCREDIBLE, the rooms were clean and stunning, the staff were so happy & kind. The best part? The sunset right from the hotel was even more beautiful than Oia. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, the BEST hotel in Fira. We cannot wait to come and stay here again!",1
"Spectacular views, wonderful suite, and exceptional staff! The owners made us feel exceptionally welcome, took care of anything we needed or asked for, made reservations for us wherever we asked, they even had a car rental service come to our room with a contract so we didn't have to find one (car rental was a last minute idea on our part). I can not say enough about how nice and attentive EVERYONE was who worked there as well. I would go back there in a heartbeat!",1
"We chose Anteliz for its location and based on its tripadvisor reviews. It surpassed our expectations. We arrived by coach from the port, which had been organised by the hotel. 2 from the hotel (Jim and Edis) were waiting at the coach drop off point for us, and wheeled/carried our luggage along the cliff path from Firostefani to the hotel. Antonio greeted us at the hotel, and throughout our stay, he and his sister were helpful in responding to our questions and in booking us a great driver/car for one of the days (a big call out to Theodore from LTS – he was excellent!). We stayed in the Master Suite which was plenty big enough for the 4 of us. The suite is beautifully appointed. The main bathroom was superb, all beds were comfortable and our own private terrace was an added bonus. There we enjoyed private time in the sun, and drinks watching the gorgeous sunset. Despite the weather being hot, the rooms were cool. Unlike other ground floor rooms, there was no table/chairs just outside our room, so we ate breakfast on the main terrace. It was the most astounding view of any breakfast location we have ever enjoyed. Choice of omelettes, boiled eggs, fruit, yoghurt, bread etc, all extremely enjoyable, fresh and tasty. As other reviewers have said, there isn’t much shade on the terrace with just the two large beach umbrellas. When it was time to leave, Jim and Edis again carried our suitcases, accompanied by Antonio, this time to the hotel organised transport to the Airport. We highly recommend the Anteliz.",2
"Room was immaculate, well apppointed, with great air conditioning. The owners and staff welcomed us like family, seemingly always available to respond to our various needs. One of the managers even brought us a bottle of wine one night as we were sitting watching a spectacular sunset by the pool deck. Breakfast was great. Service was great. I would highly recommend Anteliz Suites!",1
"Anteliz is awesome because of the location, accommodation, views and staff. It is right on the cliffs by the main path, a short walk to the busy part of town, Fira and Firostefani. Our family of four stayed at the master suite which is huge and has a furnished private balcony upstairs with an unobstructed view of the stunning sunsets. The staff are wonderful, the property is very clean and beautiful, and the breakfast is good. We will definitely choose Anteliz again the next time we are back to Santorini.   Room Tip: If traveling with family, the master suite is great because it is huge and has an unobstructed view... See more room tips",0
"Wow Wow Wow this place is amazing and will not disappoint. We just travelled all over Europe and the views from the balcony, service and rooms were the best. This place is situated at the height of Fira looking over the Caldera and port. Morning breakfast served Ono your private balcony or on the main balcony looking over the Port to the volcano is breathtaking. Breakfast was the best in Europe fresh juices, coffee, yogurt or eggs and bread. The evenings with views to die for as the sun sets whilst your drinking a glass of wine will be memories that will last forever. This hotel is impressive and as people pass the suites they take photos of the pool and balcony because if its location and views. This hotel I would love to return to again. If you struggle walking it is not ideal as there are slopes to get to the suite but Santorini is difficult for anyone who struggles walking or had disabilities including chronic Asthma due to the terrain. If you book hotel book transfer with hotel they will meet you and take your bags for you this service is a must and the staff are wonderful.",0
"I cant say enough about the wonderful location, staff and rooms at this beautiful hotel. Everyone was so helpful and made our trip to Santorini extra special. The hotel is located in an ideal location...near Fira but quiet and with the best views on the caldera! Don't miss this hotel during your stay in Santorini.",0
"First time to Santorini and were so pleased with our hotel -Anteliiz Suites. Located in Fira right on the cliffs (only a short walk along the cobbled path - great photos) overlooking the caldera and the sea this is a perfect place for watching the sun rise and set on the generous pool deck/balcony. The rooms were simple and comfortable. Bathrooms were large although the grey volcanic rock was a bit freaky at first. The hosts were friendly and extremely helpful. Just a note if you are hiring a car or quad bike. Car park nearby but make sure to research your prices before you go. Hire fees MUCH cheaper per day on other side of island to Fira... Can pick up drop off at airport if booked ahead!Re Santorini - Fira is very touristy, Oia is expensive and touristy, go to the opposite side of the island for real experience of the wonderful Greek people. We met so many people by going out of the way and saw so many places driving around just getting lost - was awesome. Things to do, find a bakery OMG, tomato museum (amazing sunset photos near here), red beach is interesting, lighthouse has good views of the caldera, Fira shopping (makes sure to haggle), dinner in a taverna (just order a selection of starters they are yummy and can easily fill you up - only if you are starving order the mains as they are HUGE) .This is a great place to stay, close to all, comfy rooms, helpful hosts - what more do you need.   Room Tip: They all looked out onto the main view - the caldera, and ours walked straight onto pool deck. See more room tips",0
"Our stay was amazing with views of the Caldera to match. We stayed with friends in the master suite, a well appointed room with plenty of room for 4 adults, including 2 ensuites and an upstairs balcony with breath taking views. The staff were fantastic making you feel as part of their family, eager to assist, guide and provide almost anything at a drop of a hat. Breakfast was amazing not only for the food but also the experience of enjoying it with the amazing views, both from the terrace and our balcony.I've read it within a few reviews on TripAdvisor and have now witnessed it first hand, tourist walking by the hotel and stopping to comment in awe of the beauty of this boutique hotel.Well done staff for a most memorable experience.   Room Tip: Master suite See more room tips",0
"We stayed at Andirons Luxury Suites for a 5-day stay earlier this month. Our room (""Zeus""), which was on the top floor of the main building above the reception area, was generously proportioned and adorned in the classic Cycladic style. As it sat atop the building, it did not have that typical ""cave"" feeling that rooms built into the cliff wall have. It had 2 patios, one with extraordinary views of the sea and caldera, as well as an outdoor jacuzzi which you can access from within the room. Apart from the unique and breathtaking views, what truly separates this hotel from other 5-star proprieties I've stayed at is the level of service provided by the staff and their attention to detail. From the moment we checked in, we were warmly greeted and made to feel completely at ease and confident that they were going to take good care of us. The front desk staff provided very helpful suggestions on activities (I highly recommend the semi-private sunset cruise) and shopping, and made dinner reservations at some of the better restaurants on the island, where we were always given excellent tables.The icing on the cake was what the staff did on my girlfriend's birthday. I had mentioned to them that I had wanted a simple flower arrangement in the room while we had dinner at the hotel's fabulous restaurant (best food on the island). Their idea was much grander than I had envisioned as they sprinkled the entire room with candles and rose petals, which they also used to form a large heart on the bed within which they had laid her birthday present, along wth a lovely bouquet of flowers. During dinner, the wait staff presented my girlfriend with another flower bouquet while the band played ""Happy Birthday"" and then brought over an amazing birthday cake! My girlfriend was overwhelmed when she entered our room to discover the rose petals, candles and flowers. It's these touches that separate the truly great from the really good.We took breakfast down at the restaurant every morning, which we found to also be a nice way to get in some exercise as we managed our way down and up numerous steps to get there and back. Food selection and quality were top notch - we both indulged in the well-stocked and tasty baked goods basket that they bring to your table - in addition to ordering from a wide selection from the breakfast menu.We also made use of the lovely spa for a couples massage, which was wonderful. My girlfriend also had a facial that she absolutely loved.The only minor shortfall was the jacuzzi outside our room, which is in need of updating as many of the jet control dials were inoperable and some of the trim pieces were rusted and need to be replaced. Aside from this, everything within the room was just right.I highly recommend the Andronis and would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Santorini.   Room Tip: Rooms in the main building offer excellent views and have the added advantage of easy access to Oia... See more room tips",0
"We stayed in the 'White House' which was incredible. The room, the pool, the view. Incredible. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect in Oia. It's pricey, but worth it for a very memorable experience. Definitely want to go back again!",0
"Perfect in every way! The service is unreal, the views and location are spectacular, the best hotel in the jewel of the island, Oia. You will not be disappointed, we want to go back already. Great breakfast served on your balcony. We travel often and were blown away by the level of service from the whole staff. This hotel even looks the best from the Caldera.",0
"You have to try this hotel if you are planning to visit Santorini. Amazing staff, great food, stunning view....Nicolas and Goerge have been very accommodating and helpful. Educated team with great manners and very helpful.",0
"We spent 7 nights in Deluxe Suite with outdoor jacuzzi. The room was big and beautiful. Especially bathroom was huge. We had a private terrace with spectacular view to the sea and caldera. The staff was great. Always smiling and ready to help you in all possible ways. Special thanks for them. Restaurant Lycabettus was also something special. In our first evening we were lucky to join the special dinner by Michelin-starred chef and that was totally unforgettable event. In our last evening we had a dinner with wine tasting. The quality of local wines was excellent and sommeliers knowledge and enthusiasm for these wines was great. Having a great breakfast in private terrace with the view was something we have no words to describe, a bit of pure luxury for us.So overall Andronis Luxury Suites is a perfect place for romantic and relaxing getaway. We really hope that we would have a chance to come back some day. Maybe then we try to get suite with a private infinity pool:-)",0
"It's been 3 weeks since our honeymoon stay at Andronis Luxury Suites and we can't stop thinking about how magical our time was. The staff was 5+ Star, extremely knowledgeable, very accommodating and willing to assist us at anytime. The Poseidon suite was magnificent; it featured a breathe taking private terrace with jacuzzi over looking the Sea, an elegant cave like seating area, beautiful king size bed and a huge bathroom. Lycabettus was so wonderful we decided to dine there twice. Not only was the food out of this world, not only was the view spectacular, but the waiting staff was amazing! We met an elderly couple by the pool, the gentleman told me that they've been vacationing in Santorini for 10 years, the last 9 of those years they've been staying at Andronis Luxury Suites. There is no greater endorsement then that! WE WILL BE BACK!   Room Tip: Poseidon suite is a must! See more room tips",0
"This place is magical. We spent 6 nights here for our honeymoon and I could not have asked for anything better!TIP- The Aphrodite room is on the highest level of the hotel, so it's the most private! It has less of a cave feel but no one is walking by your door constantly, or looking into your hot tub (most importantly!) You do however get a birds eye view of everyone else's patios.Moving on... The breakfast is so good, whether you eat in your room or at the restaurant. Their iced latte's were the best I've ever had.Dining wise, Lycabettus is really good with a beautiful view, but the restaurant at the neighboring Andronis Boutique hotel is crazy delicious!!! Try the risotto and Malagusia wineWe set up a hotel/airport transfer and it was worth the 70 euros each way.Service was fantastic!! We truly had the best time.",0
"Beautiful accommodations, superior staff, fantastic location, professional in every aspect and detail. Wouldn't stay anywhere else. Staff goes out of there way to make sure your stay is seamless, effortless and most of all relaxing.",0
"My husband and I just spend out honeymoon here. It was absolutely perfect. The front desk staff was extremely helpful. They booked all of our dinners, ATV rental, catamaran, massages, etc. They take 100% care of everything. We had amazing service from the poor guy carrying our luggage up all those steps in the heat. Dimitris, the bartender, made absolutely the best drinks we have ever had. Spicy passion fruit drink was the best. The same lovely guy brought our breakfast every morning. Honestly, the hardest working and nicest group of people. The suites were gorgeous. We stayed at the Odysseas Suite. Very private and awesome little pool. The main infinite pool was a little cooler, which was nice. And the views are unparalleled. The worst part of our experience was leaving. We were both so sad, but were shipped off with hugs and well wishes.",0
"Wow! where do I begin, the stay here was Magical, Perfect, Awesome!!!! We received champagne once we arrived. Then we were presented with a bottle of white wine from Santorini. The wine there has definitely changed for the better in the last five years. It was delicious! The homemade greek yogurt and jams were the best thing I have ever had. The greek yogurt was something I have never had in my life, I couldn't get enough. Breakfast was not only was their a buffet but you could also order eggs, pancakes, waffles and basically any kind of breakfast as well. Breakfast can be delivered to your room or you can go down to the restaurant. The views from the room are mouth dropping. Every single view from any of the rooms is picture perfect. We had a warming pool off our deck, AMAZING! The service from the staff was beyond 5 Stars! Their recommendations were on point and great.   Room Tip: All the rooms are fabulous get the one with the pool See more room tips",0
"Amazing time at Andronis. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Price is steep for the summer months, but well worth it. We were deciding between here and Canaves Oia.. Decided on here because Canaves didn't have the nights we wanted.. Sure am glad Canaves was full because Andronis suites were GREAT. We had a room with a view of the caldera and a private jacuzzi. I could spend everyday chilling in the balcony. Infinity pool is amazing for pictures and surprisingly not busy, since the hotel is so small.. Also has complimentary breakfast in room.. Really clean. Outstanding hotel overall   Room Tip: Every room is probably amazing... We have one up high and you can see the main street in Oia and als... See more room tips",0
"Santorini was our last stop on our honeymoon in Greece, and the Andronis Luxury Suites did not disappoint! It is the perfect grand finale to a trip through Greece. Our only regret was that we only had 4 nights to stay. Staff was kind and accommodating, made sure we had everything that we needed at all times. When we booked we could not decide which suite to book, and ended up staying in two separate suites during our stay - the Apollo and Eros suites. Hotel staff made our switch easy, and both suites blew our minds. The Apollo suite had a huge, grotto-style hottub in the bathroom - very private and romantic, perfect for honeymooners. Also had a huge tub inside with a huge window and view of the caldera. The Eros suite, however, had an absolutely SHOW-STOPPING terrace with a great outdoor hottub; we never wanted to leave the suite, and took our breakfast outside every morning. The only drawback is the the outdoor tub had a little less privacy than the Apollo suite, but both suites were incredible. If you are going to visit Santorini, you should definitely not skimp on the luxury, and Androniz Luxury Suites is a great option for that. We WILL be back!",0
"We stayed 6 joyous nights in the Pythia Suite which is absolutely beautiful. The room is spacious with a luxurious cave like bathroom and a terrace with an outdoor jacuzzi and magnificent views. We not only loved our suite but we loved the location of our suite and the privacy on the terrace in the evening. There is no gym though the steps kept us active during our stay. The hotel itself is located in the breathtakingly beautiful setting of Oia and is close many of the restaurants and Sigalas- our favorite winery (Sigalas also offers a food and wine tasting tour directly from their website and the hotel provided transportation). The staff, especially Giorgio made us feel welcomed and accommodated all of our request- even a late checkout! Like other reviewers mentioned, we were treated to a daily luxurious breakfast which we opted to have in our room. We dined at Lycabetus, the beautiful cliff side restaurant twice which was our favorite dining experience. We wish we made reservations for the wine tasting dinner at Lycabetus as an experience to sit in the King and Queen chairs overlooking the cliff (make reservations well ahead of time as this table books quickly). We also ate at their sister hotel though we enjoyed the views and the quiet atmosphere of Lycabetus a bit more. We enjoyed a sunset dinner at 1800 and we were seated at one of the best tables which the hotel concierge booked for us along with a few other restaurants. We pretty much relaxed all week, we indulged in massages which were terrific. We only went to the pool twice and one of the most pleasant surprises at the Andronis are shaded lounge chairs and the lap pool just below the main pool for those that prefer a private like, quieter and shadier pool experience. They are first come first basis and we were lucky they were available to enjoy our last full day. Our stay was a truly luxurious experience thanks to the natural beauty and elegance of the hotel along with the incredible staff.",0
I visted the hotel in July 2016 with my wife; Andronis Luxury Suites is the best hotel in Santorini ; amazing location and view ; best service; ideal for honeymooners ; the quality of food is perfect,0
We stayed there at our honeymoon and had a great time. The staff are great and very accommodating. They are very friendly and make you feel like you're the only guests at the property. The suite is great. The view is terrific. And the location of the hotel is very convenient just halfway through the pedestrian walk in Oia.,0
Spent a wonderful week at Andronis. Our honeymoon was made extra special by the privacy of our suite. Breakfast on our terrace overlooking the caldera and Aegean sea was the most stunning was to start the day. Pools and poolside service were very welcoming and a wonderful place to spend a lazy afternoon. Recommend the sea breeze cocktail! My wife and I have so many special memories of our stay at the Andronis Executive Suites! Stunning!,0
"Have the staff arrange your transportation to and from the ferry port or the airport..It's seamless and relaxing. The drivers we had we very knowledgeable about the island, places to visit and dine. The reception at the hotel was fantastic and relaxing. The room we stayed at had fantastic views and were spacious and comfortable...as were all the amenities. The pool was fantastic and Demetri (the bartender) makes fantastic cocktails...ask for the drink he has the most pride in making, it's awesome!!The restaurant was fantastic. We treated ourselves to the ""Wine Tasting"" which I highly recommend. The seating for that is that table with the big Pink Chairs. The server/somm (Paulo)is very knowledgeable about Santorini wines..which are really good! Katerina will make sure that any meal at the restaurant is memorable.My wife and I stay at a lot of fantastic resorts and properties around the world and this is one of the best. We will make sure that we return. I highly recommend it!!",0
The other bedroom Ac is fine need to change Ac in main bedroom as bedroom is big and Ac is small. Get daikin company acs. Don't get American co acs as they are power guzzlers and useless. Japanese are best. No notice less electricity bill and service free,0
"We had a wonderful experience staying at the Andronis Boutique Hotel in Oia on the island of Thera (Santorini). The woman at reception recommended the room above the reception to us and it turned out to be an excellent choice. We are in our 70's and had some difficulty climbing the stairs from the bar pool, bar and restaurant level, so our room location minimized the number of climbs we needed to make. The view from our room was breathtaking and gave us a vista of Tholos and Nisida Nea Kameni. The staff was responsive and thoughtful. The variety and quality of the breakfasts were outstanding.",0
I was traveling with my daughter and this was our favorite place. The staff was amazing and the hotel was just perfect in every way. Our room had an amazing view and the beds were comfortable. Private pool and eating area were also amazing. Food was delicious with a Amazing variety. The hotel consigere service was excellent. Friendly and welcoming. We can't wait to go back.,0
"Good service, good location, good facility, good view, good breakfast,,,,, everything was perfect and excellent for our honeymoon. We really hope to stay there again in future... You can expect amazing experience there if you choose to stay there.",0
"This place was everything we dreamed of and more! We had the total honeymoon experience here, every little detail and surprise was so special! They made us feel like a King and Queen every single day and night. We are so thankful to the entire staff for making our honeymoon so memorable. From the perfect recommendations, to arranging reservations, to the friendly conversations, to ensuring our drinks were always full - it was perfect! I also recommend the wine tasting experience, it was very romantic and view is like no other! Thank you so much, Andronis Luxury Suites!",0
"Andronis was the perfect resort for our honeymoon getaway. It was everything and more than we could have ever imagined. You are definitely paying for a 5 star experience, and you receive it and more. The concierge and staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and are room was exquisite. I would almost guarantee you that this is the best hotel on the island.",0
"The best option of being pampered once the service is on a completely different level, with genuine warmth care and attention to every detail. The staff's helpfulness is simply unparalleled. It’s an amazing authentic luxury hotel! We Just loved it all!",0
"I was in Santorini for my honeymoon. We could stay at andronis only for a night. But we wanted to stay even longer as we were amazed by everything that this hotel offers - our suite HERA comprising of private jacuzzi, the common infinity pool just adjoining the suite, early dinner at the lycabettus restaurant with breathtaking views of caldera and the aaegen sea. All this with great service and amazing staff. Overdose of romance. Highly recommended stay with your loved one. Prebooking of suite and restaurant recommended!",1
"We didn't stay at the suites though enjoyed a 7 course gourmet event held here cooked by a Michelin star chef! The surrounding was amazing, the villas/rooms from the outside looked very lovely, the bar/restaurant area is on a cliff overlooks out to the ocean. The food was delicious and service impeccable. I imagine the rooms are equally luxurious!",0
"We booked this hotel with the hopes of excellent serviceFrom our arrival, carrying suitcases, down the steep stairs, helpful and attentive staff, detailed menus and outstanding views give this hotel a must see, and stay badgeOne of the best in the worldAwesome personal pool in the room, overlooking the Caldera, sunset and the known Santorinian sunsets, worth every penny!Beautiful rooms, with fine detail in mind.",0
"Best Hotel I ever stayed in !The staff were friendly professional and always went beyond in everyway The room was exceptionalBreakfast room service, I will always remember The pool and pool side drinks .......Perfect in every way   Room Tip: We had a mid sized suite , with a Balcony and a great view See more room tips",0
"The service and beauty of our suite were so great its difficult to start. We spent the first four nights of our honeymoon at the Andronis. Giorgio and Vassileia's service and accommodations were the most professional and pleasant ever experienced . All the employees were great. Excellent breakfast, beautiful view, and very comfortable and exquisite room. Wish we stayed there for the whole trip!!   Room Tip: They are all great See more room tips",0
My husband and I stayed here for 3 days while honeymooning in Greece and it was an absolute dream. The service was professional and always very friendly. We really appreciate those strong fellas helping us with our luggage up and down those steep hills! The views are breathtaking and we so enjoyed our private heated pool! I dream of returning to this beautiful place with my husband one day.,1
"Brief:Perfection... i'm not even going to use another word. It was just perfectRoom:Where to start? The room is huge, with an amazing king sized bed, couch, and small dining table. Dedicated wi-fi in room, also wi-fi available by the pool. concrete mosaic tiled hot tub in the private balcony with views of Oia and of the ocean.Huge bathroom with heaps of bench space, massive seperate shower with wrap around concrete bench.The room was just beautiful.Bed:Huge King Size bed... they even emailed us a week before check in to allow us to customise the pillow and sheets, amazing service. Perfect linen and mattress, excellent sleep.View: Amazing view of Oia plus the ocean. Semi obstructed towards the west, but all the rooms have a different view. Other rooms didn't have a view of the city.Hotel facilities: Two infinity pools looking out over the volcano and the rest of Santorini. Deck chairs around with impeccable bar service.Spa center, but no gym which was a bit of a disappointment, but the stairs should be enough of a work out.Really nice lobby and drinks on check in.Hotel Breakfast:Amazing breakfast menu, literally pick what you want, and how you want it, and customise it as much as you like. Delivered to your bedroom or you can have it at the pool. Or just forget to fill out the menu like i did and rock up to the restaurant and order what you like.Hotel Dining:Dinner at the Lycabettus is one of the best dining experiences you are likely to have in your life. Just sitting at the table is worth paying for. only 6 tables make up the cliff top restaurant with panoramic views of Oia and Santorini Bay.The service... impeccable, the food... amazing. Fine dining at its best.Location:Right in the heart of Oia, Santorini, this location gives you the absolute best views of the town and the bay, take endless photo's by the pool or any of the hotel grounds. Walk along the marble tiled path and shop at the boutiques.Walk down to the very end and ride a donkey down to the Ammoudi Bay and have dinner while you watch the sunset.Getting to/from:Transfers to and from the airport or seaport for €70 in a luxury Mercedes E-CLass.Staff:Cannot speak highly enough of the staff. They treat you like absolute royalty, the full celebrity treatment. And at least one high profile VIP German soccer player stayed there while we were there. But the staff still went above and beyond to provide any service. I left my glasses in the seaport transfer, and they found it and delivered it to me when i was staying in another part of the island towards the end of the trip.They were absolutely amazing. Every single staff in the hotel there to make your stay as comfortable as possible.Conclusion:It would be hard to find a better hotel anywhere in the world within the same price range. Even the local taxi drivers told me it was the best hotel in all of Santorini.Cant wait to visit again.PERFECT!!!",1
"My husband and I are on our honeymoon and we are currently in Mykonos and we had such an amazing experience I had to review now. The hotel is in Oia which is a wonderful spot of Santorini! The staff here goes above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need. My husband needed nail clippers, we quickly asked the front desk before dinner. They didn't have any but said they would try to help. When we returned to our room, there was a pair on the desk. This is one simple example of many wonderful experiences in this hotel. This hotel is expensive but worth every penny. && OMG the breakfast was incredible. We ordered food at the food which was incredible as well. I'm contemplating emailing the hotel for a recipe of something I ate at the pool! Go to this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",0
"My wife and I just stayed at the Andronis Luxury Suites for our honeymoon. Based on the pics and reviews we had very high hopes for this part of our stay. Unbelievably these hopes were exceeded by a mile! From the porters that meet you on the street to carry your luggage, to the drinks while you check in, to the little touches in the room every day, this is an exceptional hotel experience.Of course Oia has breathtaking views that make everything even more special.If you are thinking of coming to Santorini for a romantic vacation Oia is the place for you and the Andronis Luxury Suites should be at the top of your list of places to stay. You will never regret it nor will you ever forget it!",0
"Fantastic property located on the caldera cliffside in Oia - very warm and polite hotel reception / concierge, spartan(ish) yet cool-chic suite with terrace and jacuzzi overlooking the magnificent caldera. Excellent cuisine and great breakfast at the Lycabettus hotel restaurant with stunning views, also obtained from the lap pool area. The entire experience is the stuff of dreams, no more and no less. Top Top Top!",1
"It's hard to improve on the perfection of the Santorini scenery and the beauty of a luxury hotel - however the staff at Andirons hotel manage to do just fine, with their kind, welcoming and efficient manner. It felt like coming home every time and frankly - I kinda miss the manager, George!",1
"During our 2 weeks between Mykonos and Santorini, this was by far the most amazing part of our entire trip.The island of Santorini is gorgeous.As far as the hotel, Andronis Luxury Suites goes... well, it cannot be described by words or images (but I'll try my best). Coming from someone who has stayed at 5-Star resorts all around the world; our stay at Andronis was something so special, that I think it has become my favorite.I give all the credit in the world to the staff. From the bellboy who has to carry your luggage up and down a million steps (with no problem), to the entire front desk - who will jump through hoops to ensure your happiness, housekeeping, and wait-staff. Literally everyone did a part to make our stay so incredible. I cannot recall the woman from the front desk who helped us so much, but she looked like Mila Kunis. She deserves praise!!The property is stunning. It is very well kept and maintained, and if you wake up early enough, you'll witness all the hard-work they go through to upkeep it.There are a million steps, but that is what Santorini is... so be prepared.The two infinity pools are gorgeous, with full unobstructed views of the Caldera that no other property can match.We stayed in the Hera Suite, which was a beautiful little cave immediately to the left of the main pool. We had a gorgeous large room, sitting area, comfortable bed (with a choice and selection of pillows as per your request), and a beautiful bathroom with cave shower. Outside our front door we had our own private patio overlooking the Caldera, with a beautiful hot top, hammock, and two unique lounge chairs. Staying at Andronis was literally the most peaceful experience ever... The views are something that you will never experience ever again.The restaurant at the hotel was fantastic and beautiful. The food was perfect, and the entire kitchen staff and wait staff, does everything to make sure you're happy. They knew that we loved our food so much, that they sent a few complimentary tastes our way afterwards... It was just perfect.Our room was cleaned regularly; it almost seemed as every time we returned to our room, it had just been cleaned.I hope that I can get back to Santorini soon, and when I do get back, I won't even consider another hotel...Nothing compares to Andronis Luxury Suites!!   Room Tip: Closer to the Pool See more room tips",1
"views, staff, service, food, roomseverything was impeccablebreakfast at our own private patio.... heaventhe view is breathtakingnot too many steps to the Icarus suitestaff met us as soon as the taxi pulled into the meeting place and two men carried our luggage to the suitethe staff on this island work extremely hard, yet are always polite and cheerfuli highly recommend this hotelno children under 15 allowed due to safety reasons:the hotel is perched on a cliffso the hotel is extremely quiet and peaceful",0
"We stayed 4 nights in the second week in July. From the moment we checked in, and even before arrival, the entire staff assisted us eagerly in all reservations for dinner, recommend outings and arranged sailing. Top notch staff. Everyone was very friendly and made us feel like a part of their family. Giorgio Farne was especially nice and helpful!! The pool, rooms and dining are all five star. The food is on par with the Amalfi cost resorts, and that's an extremely high bar as we consider that to be the highest benchmark we have experienced, and we are well travelled and stay at the best resorts. The local food is excellent off property too! Do not hesitate to stay at any of the 3 Andronis hotels in Santorini. They are all next door to each other and offer a luxury.",0
"The Andronis Luxury Suites is a six star experience. We spent a week here at the beginning of June for our Honeymoon. Thank you to Giorgio, Kostas, Dimitris and Tasos for making our stay beyond perfect. The Andronis goes above and beyond in every regard. By far, it's the best place to stay on the island, high quality, high standards of excellence. We will remember our time with you always, Thank you - Nicholas and Miranda",0
"We booked a very nice and large suite with jacuzzi and balcony to the south (beautifull view on the caldera) and one balcony to the west (sunset direction). The breakfast could be held in the room or at the restaurant : large choise in a variety of dishes and drinks. Also the choise 'a la carte' for dinner was great and tastfull , but from our point of view somewhat expensive. Franck and Charlotte from Belgium   Room Tip: You can ask advises to the concierge Giorgio. This person will be glad to help you. See more room tips",1
"My family and I have travelled the world, and this is one of the best hotel stays we have ever had! Andronis Luxury Suites is simply fantastic. After arriving in Santorini we were deeply disappointed with a hotel that our travel agent selected. A quick call to Andronis reservations saved our Santorini vacation. On the phone Chris said ""of course we we can help. Come over"". From that point on we heard ""of course we can do that"" dozens of times. From the front desk staff who organized the collection of our luggage from the other hotel, to Nadia who arranged spectacular rooms for our stay. The flowers were a nice touch!Every room of the 24 suites is unique and beautifully appointed. We saw 4 of them and each has superb view of the Caldera, a personal pool and/or jacuzzi and spacious quarters that are beautifully appointed. We loved the ""Apollo suite"" with best views of the Caldera. The Iris suite was great and private. The common amenities are spectacular from the welcoming reception area steps away from the pedestrian path and all the best shops in Oia, to the great infinity pools overlooking majestic views of the Caldera and volcano. The restaurant serves among the best food on the island with gracious and very attentive staff. All were more than willing to help, no matter what the request. Breakfast is a la carte and delightful. But for a real experience you must have a dinner ""on the peninsula"" the most dramatic seat in Santorini. You will not forget this experience but book early. If you can't get it for dinner, show up early for breakfast and Thassos or one of the staff will set it up for you. Sunset drinks at the bar are a must. Say hi to Dmitry the in-house mixologist who will create anything for you always with a smile. Try the Bartenders Special, you won't forget it. I can't say enough about this great hotel, but especially to the people that we got to know and were super-helpful and super-kind. Giorgio in guest relations is the best. As a long time member of the Andronis group he is full of great recommendations of what t do, the best places to eat, at where to find what you are after. Even finding a local sports bar to see Euro 2016 game! Ciao Giorgio... Mille Grazie! Also ask for Nadia she is a wealth of information and full of smiles. And we have to give a big thanks and hug to Yota. She runs the best boutiques on the island, Andronis wear for men and women, and dressed my ladies exceptionally while also making the shopping experience fun. A tip- as an Andronis hotel guest you get a great discount at all Andronis shops! Simply the best fashion section on the island. Last , ask one of the helpful staff to arrange a Sail around the caldera We did a private one which works out best for groups of four or more. The front desk staff arranged it through Santorini Yachting and our crew was exceptional. Thank you George our Captain and Milanda his first- mate. Sunset cruises are most popular but we did it in the morning which wS less crowded in the stops along the sail, and left the evening to view the sunset from Dmitry's at Ammoudi bay. All in all a great vacation at a genuinely world class luxury hotel!",1
"We truely enjoyed our stay at Andronis. The view was superb, staff was very friendly and suites was clean, spacious and beautiful! The biggest problems were the steps to and from the rooms, as those steps can be quite steep and slippery. They staff helped with all the carrying and tugging of the luggages so there is no need to worry about that.",0
Andronis is the best place in Oia Exceptional customer service Simply amazing hotel and restaurant Fantastic food with Greek fusion cuisine The best terrace on the island Wonderful service and lovely people offering the best attention to every detail Will be back,0
It was just perfect!! We stayed three nights and wish we hadn't left. The room was incredible with the most breathtaking view that we have ever seen. Our room had a private balcony with a jacuzzi facing Caldera. The service was excellent and everybody was very polite.   Room Tip: No specific advice for the choice of the room cause all rooms are like suites with incredible view. See more room tips,0
"Spent 5 days there with my family (wife and 2 adult children). Stayed in rooms #5 and #21. When you enter both, you say ""wow"". Each room there (I was fortunate enough to tour a number of them) is unique. Both of ours had views of the water and towards Fira (I preferred this view). Our rooms were spacious but with distinctly different features. #21 has an enormous deck/patio with an in ground infinity spa overlooking the water. The room itself is large, nicely laid out and comfortable. #5 is laid out to maximize the view perfectly. Large living area and king bed is on platform facing the balcony. At the foot of the bed is a large jacuzzi tub, likewise taking advantage of the view. The bath has a spa/tiled grotto within it. Simply spectacular-however, this is the only negative- you must keep bathroom door closed or the steam/moisture of the spa makes the room too warm and humid. The problem is that when you keep the door closed, the bathroom becomes an entire steam-room. They need to install a vent to pull out the moisture. As far as service is concerned it is simply outstanding. The staff(all of them) worked to know our names, our breakfast preferences, and actively sought us out to make sure everything was great. A special thank you to Giorgio Farne. From the moment he greeted us at the parking lot until the day we left, he was always available to answer any questions, make excellent suggestions for meals and activities and ALWAYS with a smile and ""can-do"" attitude. The ladies at the front desk could not have been more professional, pleasant and helpful. Everyone's English was perfect-no issues with communicating. It is not inexpensive, but the views, staff and facilities are world class. If our travels take us back to Santorini, I would definitely stay at Andronis again.",0
"We had the wine tasting experience and was so romantic with a wonderful view of the sea, the volcano and the white houses os Oia. The sommelier explains the different wines produced in Santorini, unique in the world. The attention is great, the price is expensive.",0
"We stayed at Andronis Luxury Suites for our honeymoon and had 3 perfect nights. The view, the service, the food, the swimming pool... Everything was so perfect. This place must have one of the most idyllic settings in the world..",0
"I spent 4 days at the resort and found every single aspect of it unbelievable. Great views, smiling people and a hot tub for romantic evenings make a perfect stay. The food is something that should also be mentioned and the cliff is an experience by itself.",0
"We stayed at andronis luxury suites on June. The perfect romantic getaway. Amazing rooms, pools, food and service. All the above in a perfect surrounding and a spectacular view. Will definately go back. Totally recommended!",0
"Having heard about Greek Easter in Santorini, we took the opportunity to visit the island at the end of April. Andronis Luxury Suites was exactly what we needed for our accommodation, as guest reviews from previous visitors made us dream of a unique 3-days getaway. Service was impeccable and the view simply amazing. Everyday we were being served breakfast in the room, enjoying our privacy. We had a sunset drink at the night of our arrival and the day after we enjoyed a delicious meal. As we heard, Easter was indeed a nice experience in Santorini. Holy Friday at Pyrgos, you can see candles all around the village streets, such a picturesque scenery. Generally speaking, the whole experience was just perfect and gave us some air till summer holidays.",0
"We just loved our stay! It was just 3 nights, but we couldn't have asked for better service or setting. From the very beginning, they addressed us with charm and attentiveness. We felt very special throughout the stay. Be warned - this place (and most of Santorini) is full of steps, so you'll get your exercise! We loved our little pool and our breakfasts on the terrace looking out to the sea was magical. Our only minor complaint was the food at the restaurant for dinner. While most was very good, my partner is a chef and when he specifically asked if the fish was wild, they said yes, but later (when we tasted it) corrected themselves - it's farmed. OK for some people, but not to our liking. But again, the setting is perfect and if I ever go back, I would 100% stay here again!",0
"We were part of a larger group so I got a chance to see multiple rooms. All are very spacious some with indoor or outdoor pool resp. jacuzzis. All rooms are facong east towards caldera. We stayed on top floor with great view and probably the only one with the view of a sunset as well. Rooms service was great, staff friendly a professional. Bar and restaurant by the pool were fine. Couple things to be improved on: floor is rather hot and slippery, wifi is sporadic and kind of slow. And you must be in better shape in order to climb the the stairs leading towards the rooms on the lower part.",0
"As it was the first time I visited Santorini, I tried to receive as much of the unique energy of the island and its nature. I enjoyed relaxing in my veranda and gazing at the stunning view of the Aegean Sea and the Greek sky . The most beautiful shade of blue my eyes have ever experienced! I Thank Andronis for making my stay so magical and peaceful.",0
The rooms are exceptional and the view is out of this world! Waking up early with this view is sooooo worth it! Try to book the suits with outdoor pool. We stayed at the Exceptional suit and white house suits. Unforgettable trip.I am definitely coming back!,0
"My husband and i stayed at Andronis Luxury Suites for our honeymoon and also we had our wedding there. It was just like how we dreamed.....even better!!! All the staffs were extremely friendly. Our favourite part was the private hot water jacuzzi, In hot water looking at breathtaking view with champagne.... can't ask more!",0
"From the moment we were greeted everything was perfect. Check in was easy and pleasant. The room was ready and super clean. Breathtaking views from our room and throughout the resort. My husband and I went hiking and I ended up with sunburn in my back. Around 5am I asked them if they knew where I could buy something for surburns, they told me not to worry and five minutes later housekeeping brought me a lotion for sunburns. It worked miracles and they allowed me to keep the entire bottle. That is going above and beyond for a guest. No request was ever a problem for them. The breakfast and the service at the restaurant was also great. You can order room service, but each morning we decided to have breakfast at their outdoor restaurant. The view from the restaurant was just amazing. If you want to experience staying at a traditional Greek Villa with amazing views, but with a touch of luxury this is the place. I have traveled the world and stayed in many five star luxury properties, hands down this is one of the best properties and services I have ever experience. We got to see other properties and we were very happy we chose the Andronis. We spent six nights in Santorini and I'm glad we did that. The last two nights we stayed in property to enjoy the pool and our private outdoor jacuzzi at night. I would like to recognized and thank Georgio and all the staff for the great hospitality and for making this an amazing experience for my husband and I. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your great hospitality and attentions.   Room Tip: All villas are beautiful, but because of the location pay a little more and get at least the secon...

"Everything from the infinity pool to the honeymoon suite upgrade was fabulous. We can't praise the staff or beautiful hotel enough. Yes, we didn't see the sunset- but we were always at dinner during sunset anyway, no biggie.We ate at the hotel restaurant the first night- make reservations! The five course meal was delicious, and the wine pairing got us drunk (maybe we're lightweights)- but we didn't regret it. The other 2 nights we went to restaurants that Georgio recommended to see the sunset- and they were great too. As great as Georgio is.Two tips I learned while here are: 1) don't drink the tap water in Santorini & 2) always make dinner reservations if you're eating at 2000 (or whatever time is sunset time).Also, the semi-private catamaran cruise was great in the daytime with the sun to keep you warm, and the tour size of 20 people was just right. Small enough to not be crowded, and large enough to talk to a variety of people- with a reasonable price tag.",1
"This is the place to stay while on the island. We were pampered from the moment we stepped off the plane and the private transfer took us to the hotel. I just don't know where to begin.... the reception staff greeted us with a glass of Sangria and told us to have a seat on the couch. We were then told about the property and other things. We were escorted to our room, which the reception staff gave us an upgraded for free! Our suite was completely amazing.... a sauna in the outrageously big bathroom and a cute little hot tub on our patio. From the complimentary bottle of wine to the made to order breakfast, everything was just perfect! Oia (the part of the island where we stayed) reminded me of Capri, Italy. It's a very quaint area. The streets are made of stone (no vehicle traffic).   Room Tip: All of the suites face the Aegean Sea so there is no bad room! See more room tips",0
"The view is stunning! They greeted us so kind and warmly with a glass of sangria and offered great advice. In our room they have us sweet goodies and a bottle of wine. They were easy to communicate with via email beforehand. I was planning a special birthday dinner for my partner's 50th birthday, and had a dinner at the chef's table with spectacular view reserved (shown in pink chairs on the website). The weather surprised us by being too windy to sit outside. The inside of the restaurant was fine, though not spectacular by any means. I love great atmosphere and it was just....fine. But disappointing compared to the special view. My partner and I are not foodies but I will say this particular meal could've turned us into one. The service in the restaurant was outstanding and the 12 course meal was amazing. Put that outside in the chairs and you would be in heaven. What the manager did to help me with my surprise gift (which I had planned to give him at the table outside) was to instead call back to the front desk and they set candles and rose petals all over our room. They also helped us set up a yacht tour, which was great. It is perfectly located on the pedestrian walk. Be warned the stairs are fairly treacherous - it you are unstable or have difficulty climbing it would be difficult (check to see if they have rooms on the main level, though - it is worth it).",0
"Wow! My wife and I live in Malta, so it's not like we were coming in from Nebraska or something (nothing against Nebraska). There are not many places that we visit that I instantly say ""we are coming back"". So the bad, LOTS of stairs. For us, it was like morning gym and I had no problem. I'm sure older people might struggle, but other than that there is nothing I can say. The hotel is right in the middle of all of the shops and restaurants. Morning breakfast delivered to room can't be beat. We were in the Phoebe suite and would not want another room. For the geeks, the wifi was realt good as well.",0
Our stay at Andronis Luxury Suites was magical and we were well taken care of! Their breakfast menu was really good and the services and amenities were brilliant. The spa was very relaxing and they had under the stars massage which I imagine would be one hell of an experience!,0
"Our 5 days at Andronis was faultless. From the incredible view from our room to the amenities, staff, location - just perfect. The restaurant for dinner is a must - Chef creates a work of edible art with the food. It was an experience we won't forget, as was the stay.10/10",0
"Andronis Luxury Suites offers a breathtaking view of the caldera and a pampering stay for even the most demanding person. Every room is decorated in an authentic Cyclades style, bare of any ""overdecorations"" and is either equipped with a Jacuzzi or small private pool. When I visited they informed me that due to a malfunction the hottub on the room I had booked wasn't working, so they upgraded my stay to an even more spacious room for free! I wasn't even planning on using it in the first place! The breakfast is an experience. Most rooms ask for breakfast in bed, but I highly recommend to enjoy it on the balcony of Lycabettus, the hotel's restaurant, where you can enjoy the a la carte breakfast menu with the view of the cliff and talk to the friendly staff that always have something interesting to propose you do the rest of your day. The only drawback is the main pool which is small by any standards. It's a lovely spot to refresh on a hot day, but its size is not ideal for your morning workout. However Dimitris at the pool bar is amazing, fun and comes from a family of bartenders! His signature cocktails are the perfect afternoon refreshments any day.",0
"We stayed at the Andronis Luxury Suites for 3 nights. The property was amazing. We stayed in the Hera Suite which had an amazing outdoor hot tube on a large patio overlooking the caldera. Breakfast was delivered to us every morning out there and it was delicious. Fresh breads and jams in addition to whatever we ordered. The room was built into the cliff so it was like being in a cave. We loved it! The room was right outside the pool, which was perfect for us. It seemed like it was our own private pool/bar with maybe 1-2 other couples there during the day. Would def go back! The only downside was all the stairs, but that seems to be all of Santorini!",0
My husband And I totally loved this place!The staff is very warm and hospitable..The property is very beautiful...The suite was fantastic with a wonderful sea and caldera view.The overall treatment was very grand..the staff made us feel really special.Andronis suites are highly recommended!,0
"We originally had a different hotel reserved on Santorini and the reservation was cancelled by mistake and we were given the Andronis instead. The rooms were amazing including our own spa and pool in a ""cave"". The hotel served a full breakfast on our patio each morning while we looked out at the Santorini ""Caldron"".The service was great and the staff was wonderful. The only negative we had was the day we arrived. We didn't know we couldn't drive to the hotel and after trying to find it, we were met by the manager where we parked and he had someone carry all of our bags up the stairs and to the hotel. We were told we had been upgraded and from then on, it was an outstanding stay.   Room Tip: Try and get a room near the top of the cliff so you don't have too many steps. See more room tips",0
"The customer service, the view and food were amazing ....staff is always ready to help suggesting activities, responding to requests ...hotel is very clean and all aspects of the stay were taken care of.",0
"We spent 3 romantic nights in this hotel, the staff is friendly and accomodating, the hotel has an amazing view of the caldera and the jacuzzi transforms an already very nice moment in a dream.The restaurant offers a nice wine tasting in a very romantic spot on the caldera. The breakfast served in the room is very good and with many choices.",0
"We spend 3 nights in Andronis for our (Orthodox) Easter holidays and were pleasantly surprised with upgrade to Hermes Luxury suite. This is an amazing and incredible place to stay in Santorini, probably one of the best hotels on the island. Located just in the centre part of the main street of the beautiful Oia village, all suites have a splendid panoramic view of the sea and near islands, offering unparalleled relaxing experience. Everything about this hotel is perfect: design and styling of the rooms, the private spa pools on the balconies, restaurant, bar and pools and of course, the staff. Hotel staff are extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful, it is pleasure really contacting them for any need you may have.We can hardly describe with more words how wonderful we felt in this hotel, it is best if you can try it on your own. As for us, we will return back again with great pleasure.",1
We stayed at the Andronis Luxury Suites during the last 3 nights of our 2 week journey around the world. This hotel was the perfect retreat for relaxation. The service is stupendous. The food- unreal! The views- unforgettable! The room- a dream! We booked a regular (but beautiful) suite during our stay but the lovely management at the hotel upgraded us to the cave jacuzzi suite and OMG! It was sooo amazing especially since we had just gotten engaged a few nights before <3 A BIG thank you to everyone of your staff members for an unforgettable stay!

"I booked this romantic holiday to propose to my girlfriend and Andronis Luxury Suites stood out for me. They were extremely accommodating with special requests before I arrived and their communication was fantastic. I wanted to hire a boat and Andronis sorted it all out for me with a fantastic company called Spiridakos.The customer service from all staff at the hotel was incredible. They really went above and beyond the call of duty to make us feel special! They upgraded me from the Exception Suite to the White House which was beautiful with a private pool! The view out to Sea was mesmerizing.We had dinner at their restaurant which was in the most beautiful setting and the food was Michelin Star level! The breakfast was also delicious.Can honestly say that this is the best experience I've had with a hotel (and I've been to a lot!) Will definitely be coming back to visit, thank you for everything!",1
"I love Andronis Luxury Suites! I stayed in suite 5 with my partner (its the one with the indoor cave) and it was amazing! The only thing I'd warn you about it to make sure you put the A/C on because if you don't the Cave will make your room a sauna. The staff we AMAZING, extremely helpful and very friendly. The hotel is located in a great place and compared to other hotels not as many steps (you'll understand what I mean when you go there!) and plenty of places to eat, and of course, the breath taking views. I've only been back 2 days but i'm still dreaming about the place, its such a romantic destination.   Room Tip: suite 5 AKA honeymoon suite (but you DON'T need to be on your honeymoon!! I wasn't) See more room tips",2
We just got back from our babymoon in Santorini. We stayed 5 days at Andronis Luxary Suites and it was utter heaven. We were well received by the Hotel and warmly welcomed. They accommodated to the fact I was pregnant and I was provided a room with no steps ….which was a huge bonus. Breakfast everyday was bliss and yummy. My husband also fell ill during the break and the reception staff looked after my husband as if he was family. The best bit about the hotel….was the view. Every room has an amazing view of the Sea and the island …words nor photos could do it justice. Andronis you were every I wished for and more.,0
"I think I'm still dreaming of our time in the Hera Suite at Andronis. The balcony was unreal, with views of the Caldera, a hammock, lounge chairs, and our private hot tub. With breakfast served on the terrace each morning and a suite constructed like a traditional Santorini House (and the coolest bathroom I've ever had at a hotel), our stay was total bliss.The staff, particularly the Italian manager (I wish I could remember his name!) who greeted us and took care of us during our stay, were all exceptional. We were treated to champagne (in honor of our honeymoon) and massages at the spa, which were just the icing on the cake of an amazing visit. The location in Oia makes it easy to meander around town, go sailing, see sunsets (though we had bad luck with clouds during our stay), and pop out for drinks or food as you need.One thing to note: if you're on one of the suites on the lower part of the property (which is built into a cliff, which is why it has such stunning views), it's a steep climb to get out to the main street or down to your hotel, which may not be as suitable for those who have issues with steep stair climbs.If you want to be absolutely pampered and leave completely relaxed, splurge and book your stay in Santorini here.   Room Tip: The Hera Suite is excpetional See more room tips",0
"We stayed at the hotel in a standard room in early April. The room was stunning with a hot tub on the balcony, sea view and spacious bathroom. A highlight was the incredible breakfast served either in your room or in the hotel restaurant overlooking the caldera. The pool was heated with a phenominal view and pool bar. It's hard to fault the hotel which sits in a quiet part of the village but still only steps away from fantastic restaurants and bars.The staff were charming, helpful and always available. Nothing was too much trouble and we felt very welcome. I'd whole heartedly reconmend this hotel to anyone looking for a touch of luxury in Santorini.",0
"Set one foot in this high-end small luxury suite hotel and you know you are at the right place. The sublime staff welcome's you in a perfect way. All the 27 suites have there own outside jacuzzi! What a feeling sitting in this hot-tub overlooking the bay!The restaurant deserves a Michelin star (but Michelin doesn't visit the Greek islands!). Love the poolbeds, the breakfast at the suite, the tempura matrasses and the spacious bathroom with Chopard products. This hotel is one of Greece bests!!!!",0
"If you’re booking in advance and money isn’t a hindrance I suggest you book the exceptional suite because it’s absolutely awesome. Aside from being wonderful, large and extravagant you also your very own private Jacuzzi. How amazing is that?As everyone else has stated, the employees of Andronis are top-tier. They are excellent and they always deliver excellence. I don’t know how they perform so highly but they do. They make you feel important and valued and they make your stay great. Heck, if you want something not on the menu they will make it for you. Also, the toast with fried egg for breakfast was so delicious. I sometimes yearn for it even now. Bar staff and drinks are top-notch and Dimitri is a lovely person to chat.While we were there a wedding took place and we stood and watched as it was something out of a movie. I can’t even imagine how wonderful it was to get married her",0
If you come here make certain you stay at least four or five days. Andronis was definitely the trip dreams are made of! The service here is absolutely outstanding and when we arrived we were welcomed with smiles and a local sangria. Our special dinner was on their cliff restaurant and it overlooked the deep-blue water. It was like living a postcard. And the food was delicious. Everything I ate at the resort was good if not great. From the superb meal to the flawless service… the entire experience was so perfect and beautiful. I am curious as to the statistic of returning customers as I know I will return soon. I want to go each and every year!   Room Tip: Lookout for Georgio. He's the best! See more room tips,1
"Every second of our stay here had us content. Amazing. I love how the rooms are situated far enough from one another so you receive privacy. The bed we slept in was super comfy as well. We wrote down the mattress name as we want it for our own home! As mentioned, everything here is perfect and the staff will do whatever it takes to make you feel like you’re walking on air. Our room had a private terrace which was amazing: especially because it also had a hot tub. We took the advice of the staff’s knowledge… I think this is an excellent tip to partake in. They know the best restaurants and will ask you questions and consider them so they can match you with a place you will love. Giorgio (front desk) is al all-star and he will help you with anything.George the manager runs very skillfully this property and you will always see him around making sure everything is perfect!I also suggest anyone staying here who reads this check out the room tips on TripAdvisor as they have some useful tidbits that will make your stay more enjoyable.

Loved every bit of it .. very friendly staff .. still dreaming about the breakfast and everything was truly perfect beautiful scenary tried cave pool suit and exceptional suit .. both were great this hotel made our trip magical totally recommend it .,1
"Andronis exceeded our expectations. We travel a good amount and are not always super pleased (last Christmas in Puerto Vallarta, for example) and we did a good amount of research before choosing Andronis. It was fantastic. Besides the incredible beauty of the location, the staff were exceptional. They were always cheerful, helpful, and thoughtful. They did everything they possibly could to make our vacation special. Georges, Cristos, Ares, Mary, Maria, Jonna, Anastasia, Theo, to name a few... Their friendly and good natured approach helped us to relax immediately. The hotel is also very quiet and peaceful, which we wanted. We loved Oia as well. So glad we chose that location. It's truly dreamy and so romantic. We will be back!",0
"Staying in Adronis Boutique Hotel was my husband’s birthday gift to me! His choice left me speechless, as he had taken care of everything and I found myself in this little paradise. It is the ideal paradise. It is the ideal place for relaxation! The room, resembling a cave, was the most special escape, and the evenings enjoying a cocktail a cocktail by the swimming pool were fascinating! The highlight of our stay was the evening we enjoyed dinner in the very romantic restaurant of the hotel! :)",0
"I can't rave enough about our stay at Andronis. First, the hotel is beautiful and is in the best part of Santorini. Before visiting Santorini, I thought the whole island was the white washed buildings with blue domes, but only Oia is. Andronis is in the middle of beautiful Oia, so every which way you look you have the views of the caldera and the domes. Also, you are walking distance to Santorini's best restaurants and bars. The rooms are super large and luxury is a priority. There is a pillow menu, turndown service, private pools and jacuzzis in many of the rooms, etc. The main pools are the ultimate place to relax and the food at the pool is wonderful, as are the cocktails. Breakfast was also delicious and the best we had in all of Greece.The service at Andronis is impeccable. The entire resort is the definition of a 5-star hotel, and you truly feel pampered while you are here.I left with the most wonderful memories and am already plotting my next trip to revisit Andronis.",0
"Amazing place, Amazing service, Amazing food, Amazing Hotel...The Lauda Restaurant is the best choice of the island and more... Food is wow..!The rooms are all fantastic but you can ask to change if you don't like it..The service was incredible.So thank you very much and hope I come back soon...",0
"The style of this hotel is really unique, perfectly matching the grace of Santorini island. All areas were clean, the room always neat and the service fantastic. Excellent choice for summertime in Greece.",0
"From the second we arrived we were treated like royalty. Every employee was there to make our stay amazing. Everything was so personable and intimid. There was no staff that passed you by that didnt ask if everything was alright and how they can help make things even better! The hotel was gorgeous as well as the views. You didnt know where to look first, every part of the place was just more breathtaking than the next. for the entirety of our stay I felt like I was living a dream! Thank you to all the staff of Andronis for making our stay the stay of a lifetime!   Room Tip: best views! See more room tips",0
"The service at The Andronis is bar none. I planned a trip here with my husband and George and Mary from the concierge team went so out of their way - I felt like I had my own personal trip planners!The staff in general were so helpful and hospitable through every guest touch point from the concierge to housekeeping and the wait staff in the restaurant. There is nothing they won't help you with and they're also incredibly thoughtful and knowledgeable when asked any questions.The room was incredible! We booked a suite with a plunge pool, jacuzzi and an incredible view of the caldera. It almost felt like a waste not to spend as much time in the room!The food was also great and if you're into fine dining, definitely recommend grabbing a table at Lauda around sunset.All in all, we had such a great time and were only disappointed that our trip was too short.",0
"Amazing hotel, restaurant, views and service... 5 star, we look forward to coming back!!! From the private room that felt like a swanky cave, to the individual pool, double decks with views pictures do not do justice, to the people that were extremely helpful and friendly, we could not have had a better experience. Only thing we would have changed is to stay for longer!",0
"Overall an excellent stay. Staff, concierge, poolside all excellent. Food Excellent!! Location was perfect for walking into town at night, and for our older kids to go back into town after parents went to bed. Concierge services were excellent. *Our only negative was that the bed was not comfortable (a mattress only about 4/5 inches thick) and this caused both of us back pain. Not sure if there was something we could have asked to be different, but in order to go back we'd want this to be better!!",1
"Andronis Boutique Hotel is where you want to stay! If your family or significant other is not impressed by your stay here, they should be replaced, not the hotel. Everything was amazing, from check-in to check-out.",0
"Amazing hotel, beautiful room. Very clean and beatiful view. We had an amazing honeymoon. The staff is very helpful and kind, they arranged a tour and rent of a car for us. The 5 hour catamaran tour is worth it. Love the organic products and food they have. Definitively I recommend the hotel.",0
"Breathtaking views, impeccable facilities, incredible staff. Great romantic honeymoon place, although we went with 5 children and still enjoyed ourselves immensely. Daily breakfast, which was included, was superb. George the manager is fantastic...always eager to please the customer. Main pool could use more lounge chairs, but when there were no chairs available we sat in the lounge chairs outside our room and private pool. The only problem is the steep steps. If you cannot climb 115-120 steps, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, it's a must! We plan on returning next year.",0
"My wife and I, along with our 3 teenage children, spent a week at the Adronis Boutique Hotel in Santorini. Our stay there was nothing less than incredible. The hotel is located in a spectacular location on the island and the views of the caldera are amazing. During our entire stay there there was not one issue or problem we encountered at the hotel. The staff was incredible and went way above and beyond to meet our needs and requests. From making a special Birthday cake for my son's Birthday that we celebrated while in Santorini, to arranging for incredible private tours of the island and dinner reservations at the best restaurants. We have nothing negative to say about our stay and would never consider staying anywhere else on Santorini.",0
"Overall, we were really happy with our stay. One complaint that I had was the way that staff at the pool handled a situation. They allowed guests to hold sun beds for several hours while they weren't at the pool while during high season there aren't enough chairs for guests at the pool. My husband and I were sharing a chair. After waiting an hour and a half, we decided that no one was sitting in the chair next to us as no one had ever sat at it the entire time. I moved one bottle of sunscreen to the side table for the guest to collect if they forgot it or decided to come to the pool. The guest showed up another hour later yelling at staff about someone taking her seat. After the guest left, I walked up and explained the situation. Staff asked me to move to another set of saved chairs. ""I said no, this guest has not been to the pool in over 2 and a half hours and we are paying guests as well. I told them that the other guest could switch seats. They then had to remove stuff from two other chairs that had been saved for over three hours. I found the entire situation unreal and felt that it was not handled appropriately. Other than that problem everything was great. Overall, we had an awesome experience.",0
"We stayed with my husband to this amazing hotel.The view to the caldera was breathtaking. The suite was very beautiful and very clean as really 5 star hotel.The staff were willing to serve all our desires, and they were very helpful with the tips that gave to us about the beaches and the places that we should visit.Cant wait to visit again this hotel!!",0
"I spent hours and days trying to figure out what hotel to stay in on Santorini. This was not our honeymoon but our 36th anniversary. This was going to be the most expensive hotel we had ever stayed at and I wanted it to be perfect. With a perfect view. I knew I wanted the Aegean Sea- but did I want the direct sunset? Which Andronis does not have. I finally decided on Andronis Boutique Hotel. It was PERFECT! It was more then PERFECT! It was more then PERFECT! To start I sent more then a few emails asking many many questions. George answered all very quickly and with plenty of detail. The suite I picked was not the best room but not the cheapest either. The room did come with airport transfers, which was a plus as we did not want to figure out how to get to that side of the island. Ariel was waiting for us when we got off the plane and off we went. The drive was over 30 min. long Ariel explained every where we driving through. We got to the Oia parking lot- short walk up to the Andronis door. Once you open the door the view just takes your breath away. I knew right then I had made the right choice. Now I live on an island where my views are beautiful but I had never seen anything like this. We checked in and were given ice cold glasses of champagne. Our room was not ready so we choose to walk around Oia and come back. Oia is only pedestrian. You are right there on the main street. Yes, there were hordes of tourists all taking pictures of the view in front of the Andronis. When we came back we were taken down down down shown the pools- there are 2 and the restaurant and then down again to our room #10 Paris. We had been upgraded to a room with a small pool. Heaven. The room and bathroom were like you were in a cave. Our patio-the view - I just can't say enough how breath taking it was. Now it was about 100 steps down - which ment 100 up. I can't say I we were up and down numerous times a day as you never wanted to leave the patio and pool. It was well worth every step. The first night we decided to eat at the hotel. We walked about 10 min. to the area where everyone goes to watch the direct view of the sunset. It was crazy the amount of people. We didn't stay to watch the sunset. It was crazy the amount of people. We didn't stay to watch the sunset. Dinner was excellent! The staff removes all the pool chairs and sets up tables and chairs over looking the sea. Just beautiful. The food was excellent. The staff were excellent! Breakfast comes with the room. Huge buffet and champagne plus a menu to order hot items . The staff- can't say enough! All so nice so accommodating.   Room Tip: If you stay close to the top people from the street can look onto your patio. #10 Paris was well wo... See more room tips",0
This hotel has one of the most beautiful views on the planet. Very romantic. We stayed here with our family but definitely plan to return just as a couple. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and catered to every request and travel need.,0
"The Andronis Hotel and everyone at it made our first trip to Greece one to remember. From checking in to checking out, the staff makes you feel like their most special guest. Beautiful rooms, delicious breakfast, breathtaking views. Such a wonderful place that we can't wait to get back to.",0
"My wife and I were celebrating our 3rd year anniversary in Santorini. We chose Andronis and it was our best decision. It worths every single penny we spent there. The room, the view and the staff are the BEST I have ever experienced. Will be back again!!!!!",0
"5 star hotel with 5 star service.! I think that in this hotel you can find the best people.! Vey polite, very kind, every single moment at our disposal! And of course that is not all about it, andronis boutique, is a hotel built on the hill of the most special island in the world...the view is stunning!!! It can de a real soothing even for the most troubled of the souls.!",1
"The place is excellent the views are fantastic and the food in the hotel restaurant a gourmet dream! The suites are beautiful, neat and clean and I like how the whole group of Andronis pays attention to small details, adding to the perfection of boutique hotel. We spent 3 amazing days there!",0
"Such a beautiful hotel! Everything about it is perfect, starting from the location, the views and also the breakfast buffet (amazing! probably one of the best buffets ever, with a variety of delicious local, freshly-baked products!).The service was impeccable, they all made us feel greater than being home! A huge thanks to the entire team.",1
"Our first time with Andronis Boutique Hotel and it was an amazing experience. George and his team were faultless (Maria, a special mention for the beach tip for us hippies!). The food in the hotel and the surrounding restaurants was superb. A special dining experience with Mr Bignon during our stay was fabulous and we will definitely be visiting his restaurant in Mayfair on our return home. The staff were exceptional in managing the steps to cater to our every needs - what a way to stay fit!A truly special place for us and look forward to revisiting",0
"We was at Andronis luxury suites two years before and this year was fully booked. So we choose Andronis Boutique, the hotel is amazing. Great atmosphere and service, the staff couldn't make you feel more comfortable, the landscape is just magnificent and the rooms are just perfect. Andronis is the synonym of luxury and exclusivity we recommend 100% both hotels.",0
"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days since we had a late departure and it was definitely the best hotel with the best service I've ever stayed in. We got the classic suite, room 6, didn't use the private jacuzzi so much, because the 2 pools were 10 feet from our suite. The suite is literally dug out of the side of the mountain and had a huge bathroom, and air conditioner worked great unlike spot we stayed 2 nights prior in Fira. The view of caldera while sunbathing and at the dinner we had at the restaurant that takes over the pool deck in the evening is the view that sells people on going to Santorini. Top shelf!",0
"Such a great location and staff. We had a great stay and really enjoyed everything about this hotel. The food was also amazing, creative and very well prepared. Can't wait to come back again in the future.",0
"The Adronis exceeded our expectations! The hotel is spectacularly beautiful and very unusual, the view was breathtaking and the service was truly fantastic! The pool/restaurant setting and view was the best of any hotel in the area and the food is delicious! Our balcony was such a treat - jacuzzi, sun beds, umbrella and table and chairs for meals - with the most unbelievably beautiful view. Some of the room have small private pools, which would have been nice to have, but we were close to the pool and really didn't miss it. The location of the hotel is perfect - in the middle of Oia's ""Main Street"". I arrived on crutches with a broken foot and our room was down multiple levels with too many steps to count- each member of the staff went out of their way to be helpful to us-they were just lovely people.",0
"We had a wonderful stay at Andronis Boutique Hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, with stunning views of the caldera from every suite. There are a lot of stairs, but we preferred our room near the pool, as it was farther away from the main pedestrian road. The staff are exceptional, and will cater to every request. The only issue we had was with our jacuzzi, as it never got properly warm, despite two requests to have the heat turned on. Also, the suite we stayed in, Nestor, had a very small balcony, with only one sunbed. We ended up laying out by the pool where there were more sunbeds, but for those who want to sunbathe in the privacy of their own balcony, be sure to request a different suite. Really, those are just minor quibbles, the service and the views more than made up for it!   Room Tip: Suites further away from the pedestrian street are more private, but require visitors to climb quite... See more room tips",0
"The hotel is Excellent superb service and beautiful Suits. It has only one problem :-It does not fit people with mobility issues or young children, as there are plenty of stairs. We had 90 from our room level to the entrance of the Hotel.",1
"We stayed at Andronis Boutique Hotel for the second time this summer. It's by far the best experience we've had at any hotel/ resort. It's a real 5 star with the focus on pampering the guests and the views and rooms are just out of this world amazing and unique. One suggestion I would make is maybe going back to the room service breakfast for free like it was in 2013. Because we were older guests the management accommodated that amenity for us and offered it for free again instead of the 15€ per person. But I think it's worth doing it again as a complimentary service for all the guests. The buffet is just as good food wise and it's still included, but the pleasure of having it on your balcony everyday is an experience that matches Andronis luxury better than the buffet. We look forward to going back :)A&D",0
"I've stayed to Andronis before, but at the also majestic Luxury Suites, however when I had to visit Santorini for just a couple of days, the suites were fully booked, so they suggested me to go at Boutique. It was amazing! The room was a huge, two storeys condo with a lovely balcony and a small terrace, where the hot-tub is located. The amenities and services are exactly what one would expect from the Andronis brand, catering for all your needs. I highly recommend the breakfast that combines a buffet with a la carte options. Choose a table in the shade, cause of the sun. I usually woke up very early, and in the deafening silence of the caldera, watched people setting up the pool and restaurant for each day! It was so serene!!   Room Tip: Rooms lower in the caldera are a bit more expensive, quite more stylish and a lot more private. See more room tips",0
"This hotel is an experience in itself. We stayed in the Iris Suite with the most spectacular views! Our bathroom was bigger than our bedroom. It is built in a cave and has a walk in shower and a separate steam shower room. Impressive to say the least. We had our own Jacuzzi and balcony with lounge chairs on our patio. Service was great. Pool is small and quiet. Not a place you would want to hang out unless you wanted to just read a book alone. There are many steps to get to our room, but it was well worth it. Location of the hotel is right in the middle of town. And just a few steps away from the parking lot where the taxi dropped us off from the airport. Highly recommend.   Room Tip: Iris Suite was an experience. You must be able to climb stairs. See more room tips",0
"Santorini was our last island to visit on our family two week island hopping trip! We were absolutely overwhelmed by how beautiful the Andronis was! We had three suites- one with a hot tub, one with a ""cave"" hot tub and one with a pool! The rooms were all beautiful and the views were outstanding! The staff was absolutely amazing! Would definitely recommend making reservations at their restaurant! We had an amazing meal! It was the perfect ending to a perfect trip!!!",0
"To begin with ,arrival at the Alta Mare was a most hospitable and warm feeling.The staff had the biggest smile for a welcome and was most helpful at any request during our whole stay.We were guided to our very cosy and cool, built inside the rock suits and the excellence of the simplicity left us speechless .A cave bath , a built bed with the most exceptional mattress, and our private jacuzzi with a view to the caldera.No words can describe the surroundings and the real view.And of course access to all external pools and facilities.We woke to face the magical caldera caldera morning and have a royal breakfast, including anything you might imagine and more .Quiet all around as everybody relaxation is most treasured, (No kids aloud so another motive for those who do not have).Lie on the deck chair , swim in the poll, have cool beverages all day..., WHO COULD NOT BUT LIVE HERE 4EVER!Later in the day a most exquisite dinner at the Lauda Restaurant at the boutique hotel that is next to the Alta Mare and a variety of tastes that you almost taste all Hellas!4 Days are not enough, but work calls back, so ...... LETS BOOK NOW FOR NEXT MAY !!!!",0
"Andronis boutique hotel offers unique experience of art culture,lifestyle and fashion.The hotel is well located in Oia with an amazing view and in perfect harmony with the environment. All rooms have breathtaking view and keep their privacy as well. This is somehow one of the best things in the hotel. Staff and managers are incredible in making you feel special.The rooms are designed with great detail to satisfy even the most demanding visitors. Sleeping was an experienceq the matress felt so comfortable that you didn't want to wake up. Everything we needed was done immediately and with great discretion. Breakfast in the hotel is an experience as well. The variety and the quality of the food was unreal. The hotel owns fashion stores where you can find contemporary designers from all over the world but with emphasis in Greek designers. Collaboration with some of the finest Greek designers gave us the chance to meet Greek fashion and to buy amazing pieces. I would definetely visit the hotel again, it was a lifetime experience.   Room Tip: best view, top quality, amazing service See more room tips",0
"From the staff to the facilities to the incredible room to the food....this experience was one of the best ever. The staff from the Head Concierge all the way down to the maintenance workers, bellmen and even the housekeeping staff were all simply incredible. As difficult as it is to take the perfect geographic location and improve on it, somehow the Andronis did it for us. Anything that we needed was taken care of and handled with pleasure. We plan to return soon and experience what for us was an unparalleled vacation.",0
My sister and I took our first trip to Greece this summer and we stayed at the Andronis while in Santorini and I have to say this is one of the best decisions we have made...ever. The quality of service at the hotel is unmatched anywhere else. The view and location is absolutely phenomenal. The rooms are beautiful with breathtaking views. Everything about the hotel was absolutely phenomenal. I would not change a single aspect about our time there. I could go on for hours gushing about how perfect the hotel is. We both said that is is so amazing that we will both return... we even now want to look into investing in a villa there. Soooo amazing!!   Room Tip: All the rooms are amazing! See more room tips,0
Andronis is a great hotel in santorini. I do recommend everyone to stay there. The customer service is unreal. The staff and the management team do the things you wouldn't expect. They treat you like a king and a queen. The hotel is beautiful with a breath taking view. The rooms are designed very nice and the housekeeping does a great job. The manager George is awesome and makes everything seems easy. They took care of anything we asked for the activities. This hotel gets a 100% score. Great job.,0
"The hotel has a top location with the most nicest view you van imagine ... it's like staying in a picture ...The pool area very calm, no chaos, nice music, very attentive staf that watched over us ... nice little extra's like a little sorbet or a nice drinkThe rooms are stunning !!! large, so nice in the rocks ... everything very stylishThe staff ... not just a staff ... they were real people !!! who made us feel so comfortable in every way ... nothing was to much to ask ... everything was done with a smile ... for sure we will come back   Room Tip: I believe every room has a superb view ... also very peaceful, no noise heard in the rooms See more room tips",0
"This property is absolutely gorgeous. Views over the Caldera, fabulous pool area, attentive staff and fantastic attention to detail and quality. Our room was spotlessly clean, well equipped, comfortable and stylish. I heartily recommend this resort to couples. (Don't bring small children as you'll be forever panicking about the stairs and big drops). It also has a number of flights of stairs so you need to be fully mobile. We had a wonderful two days in Oia and wish it was longer!",0
"This hotel exceded my expectations!!! Is more than Perfect, is outstanding!!! Breakfast owesome, with Great variety and Great quality of food. The room is Lovely, with a jakuzzi in The deck. People from The hotel is always asking you how you feel and What you need, is really very nice. The view to the cantera is beatiful and the hotel is perfectly Located in Oia, by far The Best place to stay in Santorini. The hotel personel will help you arranging The catamaran trip, 4 weel motorcycle ride, restaurant reservations, etc. It is quite expensive but it worths every penny.",0
I was impressed to find out that I had the complete view of the volcano while dining! Andronis Boutique hotel is built on the ultimate location!I couldn’t get enough of the amazing atmosphere and the unique view!,0
We spent an amazing honeymoon week in Santorini and we thank Andronis team of the Boutique hotel that made our stay so pleasant! We loved our room and the romantic dinners we had while staying there! Excellent choice for every couple who wants to visit one of the most beautiful islands in the world.,0
"Have Yourself a Little RomanceAs soon as we arrived on the island ,we were immediately welcomed by the Andronis Team driver and were also offered a glass of a refreshing drink! Througout our stay,we were really satisfied with the service , the meals (loved the breakfast buffet!) and the small details that created a perfect,romantic location!Totally recommended for unique , romantic vacation!",0
Beautiful colours and shapes in the great view of the landscape that Andronis Boutique Hotel offered!The landscape looked just like an idyllic image of a painting…Our Holidays was a unique experience .,0
"I was very impressed with the breakfast options that were offered in the buffet, and gave a really pleasant twist to my common struggle as a vegan-I always have to avoid so many products and have a hard time finding foods that I can actually consume. I was surprised to find my favourite almond milk served as well as the regular organic cow milk. Thumbs up for this thought!",0
"We stayed here at the end of May, 2016 for 5 nights. It was the last leg of our 2 week trip to Greece. What can I say that hasn't already been stated? The suite was fabulous (we had Clio), the views were spectacular, breakfast was great, and the staff was incredible. Everything they did was to make sure our stay was incredible. From talking to other people staying in Oia, (at places with similar price points) the staff here was way above other places. You just can't help but relax, enjoy, and not worry about anything (except what you want to do next). The staff was even on top of our itinerary. We had a few changes, and they knew about them before we did. Many people told us we were crazy for staying in Oia, and spending what we did, but it was worth it. We could do what we wanted in Santorini without hassle, take a bus to go were we wanted, and escape to our suite when we wanted to. It was much nicer then staying in Fira, less crowds, traffic, and cruise tours.",0
The most beautiful stay during our 25 days in Europe by far. Exceeded our expectations in every way from our accommodations to the incredible views and service! The staff is very attentive to your every need! The hotel manager Giorgos was always there making sure our every wish was taken care of. Loved this place!,0
"This hotel is PHENOMENAL. The views are unparalleled. Georgios, hotel manager, is the nicest and most detail-oriented person. He will handle all of your reservations and questions. The staff is professional and poised. The pools are fantastic. The food is fantastic. The suites are unbelievable, built literally into a cave. Very chic decor. Centrally located next to all the best dining in Oia. I could go on and on.... Many thanks to the Andronis Boutique for hosting the Santorini leg of our Honeymoon! We will definitely be returning!",1
"we stayed Andronis Boutique Hotel with my mother and sister on the end of May. all staff are friendly and kind, well-trained, they all helped us whatever we asked. we took spa treatment which was awesome, breakfast was beautiful, the view from our room was breathtaking. some clothing shops in oia offer us discount(affiliated company). this hotel is located along cliff as others are same, reception's on grand floor(that's top of this hotel) and we have to go down to pool, bar, restaurant and rooms. many steps from reception(top) to pool and restaurant(bottom). so you might need tough legs.we stayed with 3ppl in 1room, so extra bed was arranged, but it was not comfortable, it could be improved.and last 2nights we couldn't use jacuzzi in our room due to some problem, which was dissapointing but manager gave us free shuttle to the airport instead.we are satisfied with that covering.we'd choose this hotel if we come to santorini again, thank you for everything Andronis!!",0
Andronis Boutique Hotel is one of the best hotels in Santorini! I've stayed there for two weeks last year 2015 and I really enjoyed it. The room are so clean and decorated so well! The location is perfect. The employees also are friendly and always want to help you! I'm looking forward to visit this hotel again in the future!,0
"Amazing place, amazing view, amazing people....A boutique hotel which combines in the best way Oia's elegance with greek hospitality and glamour; don't forget to visit the boutiques and put some fashion in your holiday<U+2728><U+2728>Both the hotel and its boutiques are strongly recommendedI spent 3 days here and I feel so lucky to find a place that makes saying goodbye so hard!!!",0
"Santorini: The greatness of simplicity. The endless peace of an amazing volcano. Oia: white village, black rocks, blue sky, sea and domes, And some spots with colorful flowers, just at the very right places. Andronis Boutique: all that together. If you are looking for something unique and inimitable, here is it. If you are waiting for a sign, this is it!Die Pracht der Arglosigkeit! Der unwiderstehlichen Frieden eines bosen Vulkans. Wir waren dort letztes Jahr, dieses Jahr und wir mochten wieder zuruck. Zsenialis egyszeruseg, amikor a keves tobb. Egy hatalmas vulkan vegtelen bekeje. Oia: a feher falu kek kupolakkal, mint az eg es a tenger a kaldera fekete sziklain. Andronis Boutique: mindez egyutt. Itt voltunk tavaly, iden es oda vagyunk jovore is.Agnes & Laszl",1
"Firstly anyone writing a less than 5* review must really be nit picking because this hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in,even better in some ways to the posh Dubai hotel I stayed in last year. The views are breathtaking and every room enjoys them, if you can stretch to a hot tub or private plunge pool then do, you will love it but if not the pools are lovely too. Breakfast is excellent, everyone who works at the hotel are lovely,the rooms are all lovely but the suites are amazing! The only downside would be if you can't manage steps as there are lots. I loved this place and Oia is just a dream with amazing views round every corner. Book this hotel you will love it.   Room Tip: Pay for a suite See more room tips",1
"I stayed at the the Andronis Boutique Hotel with my sisters for 5 nights. Our stay at this beautiful hotel was perfect from the start to the end. We were met by George, the hotel manager who guided us to our room and thereafter gave us a tour of the hotel and was always happy to help during our stay in Santorini. On arrival at our suite, we were given welcome drinks and a variety of local fruits and a delicious vanilla yoghurt. We stayed at one of the honeymoon suites (penelope suite) which had its own jacuzzi pool hidden away and a great patio area for sun bathing in the privacy of our own suite. Before arriving, we were sent an email for our preference of pillow types and toiletries and the suite was equipped with our selections. The suite was cleaned twice a day by a lovely lady called Bahia. The staff in general were extremely polite, hospitable, friendly and nothing was too much for them and they all spoke great English. The service at Andronis was indeed 5 stars and beyond and we could not fault anything during our stay. Apart from the great service by the staff at the hotel, the location of the hotel is prime. If you are looking to stay in the beautiful Oia, on top of the Caldera, with mesmerising views, then look no further. The hotel is situated at the top of the stretch of Oia and very close to all the restaurants, cafes and shops. The selection of places to eat around the hotel is great and you also have the benefit of being so close to the sunset point in Oia, which you mustn't miss. Whilst we didn't have dinner at the hotel as we wanted to explore the restaurants around Oia and Fira, the breakfast was delicious though a bit repetitive. We will definitely be returning back to Andronis.",0
"The Andronis Boutique Hotel is not a place to stay, it is an experience. Where to begin? The kind driver was waiting for us upon our arrival at the airport, welcome drinks upon fast check in, excellent service during all our stay…plus cleanness means a great deal here. On top of that is George and Nadia who will take care of all your needs, be it for a cruise around the island (must do), taxi service and restaurant bookings. Do follow their advices as they are locals. Everything here at Andronis is simple and calm.",1
After having visited many luxurious hotels around the world trust me when I am telling you that the service and the concierge that this hotel offers to guests is beyond and above high class standarts. Everyone is smiling to you and happy to assist you. We felt like their guests and not clients. Keep on guys.,1
"Where to begin! My husband and I stayed here for our Honeymoon and we could not have chosen a more beautiful and welcoming place for our two weeks in Oia. Regarding the hotel staff- FANTASTIC! Each and every member of their staff smiled and greeted us each time we crossed paths; from sitting pool side, to entering and leaving the hotel to explore. From dawn until dusk they were there to make sure our stay was nothing short of perfect. Anytime you travel you wish to stay in a beautiful place with a view, but what takes it to the next level and labels it ""exceptional"" are the people. After two weeks, we truly felt as if we were leaving good friends as we said our goodbyes. The entire hotel was more beautiful in person than the pictures can explain. We had the opportunity to stay in a couple of rooms during our time there, and each had a different layout making it unique and cozy. No matter which room you stay in, you are guaranteed a view that will take your breath away! Everything was very clean, tidy and very comfortable. Needless to say, we would highly recommend staying here. Oia is the perfect combination of relaxation and luxury. Not too quiet and not too busy. We are beyond happy with our stay and already looking forward to a return in the near future",0
"My (new!) husband and I visited Andronis Boutique Hotel last week for our honeymoon. We had a 5 night stay that couldn't have been more perfect. The setting is just stunning and the location is perfect. Oia is certainly the place to stay although apparently in peak season the streets get very busy. The staff could not be more helpful and friendly - nothing was too much trouble The attention to detail throughout is beautiful.We booked our transfer from the airport by email to the hotel in advance of arrival and were met at arrivals by our driver. We had a private car to the hotel and they are able to charge this cost to the bill to be settled upon check out. When we arrived the porter took our luggage up the steep drive and into reception for us. We checked in which was completely painless and were taken on a tour of the hotel and talked through some of the islands history, recommendations of what to see and do, the hotel services, what time breakfast is served from through to the temperatures of the pools!We then were taken to our beautiful room (Penelope) and were lucky enough to have a completely private jacuzzi in a cave! The room was beautifully clean and luxurious with some lovely touches. I was excited to see a pillow menu but the ones provided were superb anyway so there was no need to change them! Upon arrival to our room we were given complimentary greek yoghurt with honey and fruit and a bottle of cold white wine, a really lovely touch.We ate breakfast each day down by the pool, you can have it in your room for no extra cost but the setting by the pool overlooking the sea is too beautiful to miss. At breakfast, the options are endless. It is all beautifully presented and all so delicious. It was a challenge to know when to stop eating as you want to try it all!We had a few days relaxing by the pool and towels and water were provided and it was a very relaxed environment with beautiful music playing. We ate in the restaurant one evening and again, the food was outstanding. The sommelier helped pick out wines that complimented the food perfectly. As recommended we did the sunset cruise with Santorini Yachting Club on a catamaran which Andronis booked for us and it was brilliant. We had a BBQ on board and swam in the volcanic hot springs before docking to watch the sunset - an absolute MUST. All in all the hotel, service, food is simply excellent and I cannot wait to go back, Many thanks to George for making this part of our honeymoon so memorable.   Room Tip: Choose a pool with its own pool/jacuzzi - you will not be disappointed! See more room tips",0
"Andronis Boutique Hotel...a miracle on the Earth!! I' ve just returned back home from Santorini, where i had a unique experience at Andronis Boutique Hotel! Let's start from the way that all the staff welcome us at the Hotel, Mr Giourtzidis, the chief concierge, was so kind and helpful to us, he organized for us everything with an amazing way.. additionally all the Front Desk staff made us feel like home! We had an Exceptional Suite with Plunge pool, with a breathtaking view to the caldera of Santorini! The suite was extremely beautiful, clean and cosy! The architecture of the whole Hotel was fabulous...! We stayed there for 1 week, and we are so happy that we went there to celebrate our wedding! The experience that we will never forget is the Wine Tasting that we had at the Restaurant of the Hotel, Lauda, and the perfect dinner that we had at the Chef's table! Andronis Boutique Hotel made our wedding life just a miracle! I recommend for sure this Hotel to everybody!!!",0
"We flew into Santorini and arranged a private car (I believe it was 75 Euros for two, but worth it) to pick us up at the airport. We were met by George after baggage. He was very professional, friendly and very accommodating. The ride to the hotel is approximately 20 - 30 mins depending on traffic. When we arrived into Oia, we were greeted by George the Chief Concierge (yes, another George :)) and a porter. They led us from the parking area, up the short pathway, to the hotel. (Note: when you get out of the car and realize that you have to walk up a hill to get to the hotel, don't worry. It's not that long of a walk and they have someone to help you with your luggage)As soon as we walked through the gate, we were greeted by the front desk staff. Check-in was seamless. Our key was already waiting for us. All we had to do was provide our passports and credit card. At that moment, George informed us that they upgraded our room from Classic Suite to an Executive Suite with a plunge pool. We were very excited and grateful.As George led us to our suite, we immediately noticed how beautiful the hotel was and the amazing picturesque view. The hotel, bright white, sits on the cliff and looks over the dark deep blue Aegean sea. Throughout the hotel property, little pools are scattered complimenting the already beautiful scenery. When you hear advice about booking a room with a caldera view, take it. It's absolutely breathtaking and worth the extra money. A short walk down and up some steep, but safe stairs, we were at our suite. I've stayed in a few unique and beautiful properties in Europe and I have to say that the Andronis is in my top 3 so far. We walked on to our patio with our own plunge pool. It felt very secluded and private. Once inside my room, I was amazed at the size. There was a small sitting area with a couch, table, flat screen TV and mini bar. A comfortable king size bed was towards the back of the room leaving ample room to roam around. What really took me by surprise was how large the bathroom was. It was almost the size of a room. There was plenty of closet space and shelves, plus a vanity table and mirror. The toilet and open shower were separate and off the side.Decor was simple, but chic and functional. Stone and concrete (I think, could have been stone too) and natural materials were used throughout the room (flooring and bathroom counter top) and property. Again, it was simple, but very tasteful and felt very high end. Service was exceptional. The staff from the restaurant, front desk to housekeeping were always very polite, helpful and accommodating. George, the Chief Concierge, went above and beyond to help us out. He walked us to the ATM when the one we found didn't work, made fabulous dining recommendations and even helped purchase our ferry tickets to Mykonos. The hotel was in a perfect area in Oia. It was located in the middle of the main pedestrian path and everything was easily accessible. If you forgot a hat, there is a great hat shop right across the way with great prices. Also, along the main walkway you will find lots of restaurants, shops and places to buy food. There is a great gyro place very close to the hotel...see my next review on Pitogyros. Breakfast was great. They had an assortment of everything and made to order eggs. Had lunch at the restaurant and it was pretty good too. Again, service is great - everyone was friendly and attentive.Overall, I would definitely return to the Andronis. I highly recommend this property, it's definitely worth the money. It has great ambiance! Property, service and location all get 5 stars from me. Once you arrive, the staff does everything possible to make your stay exceptional and worry free, and they definitely do!Extra plus: they have plenty of electrical plugs available for your phones, computers and hair dryer. Some hotels you have to search for them, but these are plentiful and easy to find and use. Also, if you can, get a room with a jacuzzi or plunge pool. There are two main pools, but it's really nice to have your own little one!   Room Tip: Get one with a plunge pool or jacuzzi. See more room tips",0
"Andronis is an amazing place... The staff were the greatest and were very accommodating to our needs. The hotel is located in a great location and the views are breathtaking, pictures do not this place justice. I will be going back, literally the best place I have ever stayed.   Room Tip: Any room will be great at this hotel. Lots of stairs but worth the walk See more room tips",0
"Built on the edge of a cliff in cave like traditional style, our suite was spacious with every comfort. Including a sun gallery and jacuzzi. Great service and food too. Oia is famous for its sunset. And don't miss sailing around the Caldera",0
"We've traveled very extensively and stayed in many of the top hotels in the world, but the staff at Adronis puts all of them to shame. The amount of personal attention and service these good people bring to bear is not only second to none but also just the right amount for what you need or want.Between the service, the fantastic food and wine, the excellent facilities, and the breath-taking view; for two hardened explorers like us the ONLY challenge every day, was to work up the motivation to leave the hotel and discover the rest of this enchanted island!",0
"Photos of this place don't do it justice. It was absolutely breathtaking. You cannot fault it at all. Beautiful cave suite, outdoor jacuzzi, private sun lounges on the terrace, your choice of pillows and skin care brand (and even room scent!). I think besides the place being an absolute dream, what really makes this place what it is are the staff. They were nothing short of incredible. Nothing was too much, they are all so helpful and friendly. George manages the hotel and greets everyone in person and takes you on a little tour of all the hotel facilities. He checked in with us regularly during our stay to see if there was anything we needed and genuinely wanted to make sure we enjoyed ourselves...it was a very nice, and personal touch that you don't get at many places. We can't recommend this place highly enough, it's worth every penny and then some.",0
A modern contemporary cave house. Hercules is the best room! private pool and jacuzzi overlooking the best view of Oia - the Volcanic Rocked Sea!!!Situated in the center of Oia giving you an easy access to the more down to earth part of shops and modern high end part.Staff are all attentive and friendly!,0
"I was very impressed with this hotel. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The service provided by them was second to none. The room we had was a Classic Suite, cave Jacuzzi and balcony with amazing views.We had a good choice for breakfast both veg and non-veg. Cocktails were very nice as well.Great destination for relaxation!   Room Tip: The Aoelus Classic Suite is excellent and very private. However you have to go down a few steps to g... See more room tips",1
"Every single detail of the hotel, from the rooms, food and staff is a 5-star! We were picked up by a friendly driver and provide some info on the island and also recommended places/restaurants. As this hotel is only opened the next day we arrived, they've arranged 1 night at Andronis Luxury Suites (suite with cave pool!)- few minutes walk away from the boutique hotel. We had a refreshing Santos wine and the hotel manager brought us to our suite.The next day they have arranged someone to transfer our luggage to boutique hotel. We were happily surprised by the upgrade from classic suite to elegant suite with plunge pool. This suite has amazing view of the caldera! This was perfect for our honeymoon! The hotel has room cleaning services twice a day. And the night service was a considerate one - with a sweet nougat and weather forecast of the next day! Very thoughtful.The only unfortunate for us is that the plunge pool was not hot enough for us at night. There was some issues but the hotel staff are very responsive and helpful in trying to resolve. The water is warm and perfect for afternoon, but slightly chill for night. We wake up every morning and look forward to the buffet breakfast- has lots of variety and taste yummy!!! The staff are again very attentive and friendly, to ensure we are at best comfort during our stay.Overall, I will recommend this hotel to anyone visiting and plan to stay in Oia. We looked around Oia for the few days when we were there and believe this is the best hotel, with great location, staff and also hospitality.",1
"A wonderful hotel, with a spectacular view, possibly the best in Oia. I've traveled several times to Santorini and the week I spent in this hotel, was by far the best one I've ever had on the island. The location offers a breathtaking overview of the caldera and the volcano and in combination with the steep rocks descending straight down all the way to the sea, exactly underneath the hotel rooms, creates an unique feeling.The service was one of the best I've experienced and all of the staff was really helpful, day and night.The room was exactly what you would expect on this island. It was embedded in the natural rock, and following the local tradition it was decorated in a quite minimal way and off-course the view was spectacular.... Special mention has to be made for the room's outdoor jacuzzi! The options in the restaurant's menu were a bit restrictive at the time but we were told that that would change later in the season. Nevertheless the food was delicious and once more the view from the restaurant was great.Finally, make sure that you are prepared to climb a lot of steps but that's a small price to pay for enjoying what is possibly the best view in Oia!",2
"We moved to andronis hotel after a very bad experience we had in a nabor hotel canavisoia! What a wonderful surprise this hotel turned out to be. Spacious rooms, chic decor, very clean and free WiFi available. Breakfast was included too. Never thought that nebor luxurious hotels might be so different. and the reception staff were very welcoming and friendly. We arrived at the hotel early as we just moved hotels at noon. our room was not ready but they rushed a room to be ready for us! Really appreciate it! thank you!!",1
"We really loved this hotel. It was small and personal, great location, and the views were jaw dropping. Also the rooms are cave-like, so you sleep really well. We went all around the island, and I was certain we picked the best hotel. Can't wait to go back!",1
"Fantastic hotel, so beautiful. We arrived at lunch time , and had lunch looking out over the Sea, the restaurant was fantastic. Our room was very special, our bathroom was set into the rock so it looked like a cave. We also had our own private little Jacuzzi, which was really nice. All the staff were fantastic, and a special thanks to George, for everything. This hotel is very privet , just one thing, make sure you are used to climbing steps,,,,,,,,",0
"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our honeymoon in Greece. The views upon arrival to the hotel are jawdropping. Our room (elegant suite) was very spacious and we loved sitting on the patio and enjoying views of the caldera from our jacuzzi. The service was impeccable throughout our stay, including dinner on the pool deck, breakfast each morning, and complimentary poolside refreshments brought to us while laying out. The infinity pool was great to relax in during the day, and we liked being near the shops and restaurants of Oia at night. On the last morning, they surprised us with room service breakfast at 4:00 a.m. as we had a very early 7:00 a.m. flight to Athens. Again, they went above and beyond in every way. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone - especially couples - looking for the iconic Greek cave experience.",0
"Andronis Boutique Hotel is the best place for a Greek honeymoon. Our accommodations included a private terrace overlooking the ocean and a private hot tub. Our room faced the Aegean and you could choose to open the windows or use the air conditioner. The breakfast in the morning was fresh and delicious. The staff was calm and relaxed, and we felt as if we were staying at a spa. The pools were clean, and at night the pool area turned into a restaurant. The hotel restaurant was delicious and I would highly recommend trying it ! This hotel is located within walking distance to shops and other restaurants. The entrance to the hotel is a few steps away from a place to rent 4 wheelers if you get the urge to explore (highly recommend!) in addition to a casual to-go gyro place for a quick bite. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and beautiful honeymoon experience!",0
"Stayed for several days of pure romance. Beautiful, private and very clean with luxury in a spare, modern way. We opted for the smallest room for 2 that was very affordable. To our surprise, we had a private jacuzzi and our own breathtaking view of the Adriatic sea. Inside was cool and sparse, with a wonderful bed and bath, while upstairs a private sitting area and walkout to upper deck with 2 lounge chairs. You will do some ducking when going upstairs. My husband is 6' and had no issues with it but if you are much taller, this may be bothersome. Excellent service, on arrival we were given champagne and a tour of the surroundings. Daily breakfast is included and was absolutely fantastic. If you want luxury, romance and a place to decompress, you will not be disappointed. Wifi was a bit spotty but free. Can be windy through the fall, our electricity went out briefly but was quickly back on. Location in Oia is ideal. We ventured to the other towns and they do not compare! Be sure to take a sunset boat cruise around the island, the hotel will make any and all arrangements for you.   Room Tip: If rate is important to you, then opt for the best price.

"If you are staying in Oia, you must stay here. From the location of the property to the rooms to the views, this place is amazing. You are in the center of Oia with access to everything. Our room was beautiful with a private outdoor jacuzzi. Breakfast was amazing and the view from the pool was to die for.",0
"I understand the need to rate this hotel excellent because quite frankly everyone spent a lot of money to stay here. It is beautiful. The views are extraordinary. They get very close to 5 star but there are to many small things wrong. 1) the loud voices of the staff at 8 AM as they start their day, that echo thru the caves. Right now I am sitting on our bed trying to relax but all I hear are the staff talking loudly. This is not 5 star behavior. 3) as you maneuver around the resort on the cool walkways and wonderful endless steps, prepare to step aside and let the staff pass you instead of the staff stopping to let you pass. 2) making a simple request over the phone only to never get a response. 3) being ""scolded"" literally by a manager for making waves in the pool! We had been in the pool for an hour with another couple and no one had moved a muscle because we were just taking in the awesome view??? Definitely not 5 star behavior. I feel a responsibility to mention these things on trip advisor in hopes the management will read this and improve for future guests. As I make these reviews I realize that the ultimate test of ""excellent"" is ""would I return here"". Sadly, the answer is ""no",7
"Santorini was our last stop of our 2-week-get-away, and our hotel choice was nothing short of perfection. ABH locates literally in the center of Oia with its reception right at the main st which saves time and energy just for a simple check-in. All the rooms are located below the reception through the narrow steep steps, but no worries, the helpful staffs will gladly help you with luggages. Our room was situated on the lowest level of the hotel with a private pool and an amazing view, and best of all, the privacy we wanted. Room was clean and tidy although not big, AC worked amazingly, bathroom was a bit small with no shower door and a really high toilet, patio area was a great size for two of us with the hot tub in perfect temperature (all rooms at ABH has hot tubs btw), and the pool was not heated but still amazing to just chill and look out the beautiful view without having to hike up the steps to reach the public pool. Try at least one room service menu because it's worth it - very tasty and reasonably priced.Breakfast at ABH was decent. We are not the big meal breakfast kind of people, so their selection was more than enough, and tasted great. No, there's no direct sunset view from the hotel, but the 5-10 min walk will take you to the spot to watch the world famous santorini sunset. If you're not into all that pushy crowd and hectic, order a room service and you can still enjoy the colorful horizon the sun creates from your own room/patio.Yes, there may be some hit and miss with this property as with any others. But those can be something so small compared to the great stay you'll have here, so don't let the little things ruin the unforgettables. Remember not everyone may be as lucky as you to stay in Santorini, and especially Andronis.",0
"No matter how many times we've looked at the pictures, we are still amazed by the gorgeous view from the hotel. Their service, to match the view, was impeccable. From the moment we arrived at the hotel to the time we checked out, we were well taken care of by the staff. It was a nice touch when they brought over a bottle of their own white wine with yogurt and fruit spread. Having a drink while relaxing in the infinity pool is a must, as is enjoying the sun by the poolside. The room was spacious and nicely appointed. Soaking in the outdoor jacuzzi of our room was the perfect way to wind down at night.The location is unique--it's private such that non-hotel guests cannot walk through the hotel grounds for photo ops. However, do expect to walk some steps to get around within the hotel grounds. Thank you for a wonderful holiday.",0
"This property does not disappoint! Prior to arrival we received a questionnaire regarding several of our preferences such as pillow and toiletree type along with the offer to set up any add on services such as wine tasting, dinner reservations, spa, etc. Upon arrival we were greeted with champagne, accompanied to our room and provided a tour of the property. As to be expected the views were amazing but the service was top notch too. We usually dread having to call the front desk for anything cause we hate waiting for ages...not here! Anything we requested arrived in less than 5 minutes (ice buckets, hot tub adjustments, towels, etc.). The breakfast spread had something for everyone including hot meals made to order and there is a reason the dinner restaurant is one of the top rated. Flavorful food, good portions, knowledgeable and attentive staff and a great view of Oia. We didn't want to leave and can't wait to return!",0
"Everything was perfect for us here, starting with the amazing view, the excellent location, the frienly and helpful staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere. We found the location excellent, being in a fairly quiet area, yet on the beautiful path from Fira to Oia. We would be very happy to return.",1
"The perfect way to end our 5 week European holiday. We were made to feel welcome not only on arrival but during emails and phone conversations. The staff were extremely welcoming, generous and accommodating throughout our entire stay. We arrived into Santorini after a red eye flight from Barcelona. We had a delicious Mediterranean omelette with coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice then laid by the pool while our room was being prepared. We could have very easily stayed at the hotel for the entire 5 days we were in Santorini as the view, tranquility and food options were more than enough. However, when we reluctantly left the hotel to explore the island, Mary and Ioanna were spot on with their recommendations when it came to excursions. Eddies cocktails and bar service deserve a special mention as do the culinary skills of Chef Spyros, son of owner Ioanna. What a talent !! Not only was the presentation of the food first class, the portions were big the fusion of flavours were incredible. In regards to the sunset, I have been to Santorini before and have seen the sunset from both Oia and now from Imerovigli. In my opinion, the best view is definitely from Afroessa, Imerovigli with unobstructed views of the horizon, ocean, volcano and islands. Lastly, we were made to feel like we were part of the family at this gorgeous boutique hotel. Everything from our long conversations with staff to making sure my wife was feeling ok while she was battling the flu. Thank you to the Afroessa team, everyone from owner Ioanna, to Mary, Super Chef Spyros, barman and legend Eddie, Ntina, Spresa, Dora, Ilias and Litsa. A million thank you's for this unforgettable experience.",0
"Amazing small hotel! Their hospitality was exceptional. Mary was helpful and knowledgeable! Great place and unbelievable sunset views! Don't go to extremely crowded Oia and be squeezed by million people and be disappointed but stay in Afroessa and have a lovely romantic dinner on your room terrace or on the main terrace. The place is very quiet and we loved the fact that children are not allowed! They treated us like one of their own. The food was amazing and value for money. We stayed in their smallest but extremely clean room but the size didn't matter because the views and the outdoor place was unbelievably beautiful. We want to come back soon and we are sorry we couldn't stay longer and had to go Naxos where the quality of the 5* hotel was incomparable terrible!! We will recommend Afroessa to everyone!! Thank you Mary, Judith and all the staff!   Room Tip: All rooms are sea view. See more room tips",0
"Simply spectacular! The view the service the location was absolute perfection. The breakfast and the restaurant was superb. Staying in Imervegili was peaceful. Oia too busy and Fira too crowded. The team were brilliant keeping track of our activities, organised amazing dinners and ATV hire and cars. They knew the best places to visit on the island and were very hospitable.",1
"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was wonderful. Ioanna and her family were delightful and made us feel vey much at home. Location is stunning, breathtaking views while your having dinner. best place to stay in Santorini. best yoghurt, fruits and honey we've ever had for breakfast. So nice to come back to a peaceful, intimate hotel after a busy day around Santorini.",0
"Came here with my girlfriend (now fiancee after proposing to her while watching the sunset from Skaros rock - definitely a walk worth doing) for a weeks holiday and had high expectations based on the 5* ratings. Stayed in room 5 which was one of the standard double rooms however it was more than standard. A king size bed, living space, kitchen and ensuite, all of which was spotlessly clean, very romantic and authentic. The room was located off one of the walkways but this should not put you off as the area is alot quieter than the main centre (Fira) and there was only the occasional passerby. It has to be said that the views from this room were outstanding and there was an unobstructed panoramic view of the entire Caldera, which having went to Oia for two evenings I must agree with Ioanna (owner) that the best view of the sunset is from Imerovigli. Moving onto the staff, words cannot describe how helpful, friendly and caring they were for the entire stay, I have never met such a friendly bunch of people. The food at the hotel is also amazing. Cooked by Spiros (owners son) I must recommend the Muami burger, it is incredible! Also Eddie the waiter makes a mean mojito . Overall, I cannot say a bad word about our stay and the hotel. It helped make our holiday truly one to remember. Thank you Afroessa. We will see you soon! Simon and Ashleigh. (Wales)",0
"We stayed here for 3 nights and we loved our stay. First of all my boyfriend arranged the whole thing, and when we got to the room they had given us a bottle of champagne and rose petals in the room as he requested. It was so romantic and was really nice of them to do this for us. The staff at the hotel were incredible. They were very helpful and friendly and they knew all the guests personally because of the size of the hotel. It was an incredibly personal experience for us. They gave us great suggestions for things to do and they coordinated all transfers for us, including taxis at night, atv bikes etc. Anything you need just ask and they will help. I have never experienced a more personal stay in a hotel. Location: the hotel is located in imerovigli, which is between fira and oia. Oia is about a 15-20 minute drive ( 3-4 hour walk) taxi was 20 euro one way. Fira is only a 5 min drive or you can walk along the path Infront of all the hotels. But the walk takes about 45 min depending on your speed. If you walk along the main road it would be faster but there are no sidewalks. I think the hotel location has the best sunset with its position. I much prefer the sunset in Fira and imerovigli to oia as in oia it's on an angle so you don't get the full effect of it. If you want to party at night you have to go to Fira. That's where all the bars are that are open late. We went to oia one night and it was dead so oia is not the place to be if you want to stay out late. Most of the restaurants are open still in oia so you can have a chill night. I recall only one bar that was open past midnight. Fira is where all the cruise ships dock so it has an abundance of stores, restaurants and bars. I don't think Imerovigli had any bars just a few restaurants. I recommend the restaurant right near the hotel called avocado which I wrote a review for. Get a reservation - it's amazing. Hotel: the hotel is typical on the cliff inside a cave feel. Our room had a little sitting area, small kitchen with plates utensils sink and kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. We also had robes and slippers. It was a very nice room and the bed was soft so if you like soft beds you will be happy. We had a lovely terrace looking out to the sunset and in the morning we even ordered breakfast to eat outside. The breakfast at the hotel was very good! The Mediterranean omelette was delicious. If you want the romance this is the place. Things we did: we did a sunset cruise around santorini which was very nice. They fed you dinner (souvlaki, Greek salad, etc) and took you to the red beach, hot springs and one other location. There are a bunch of tour operators so the hotel can arrange this for you. We also rented an atv ( completely arranged by the hotel) which we took to drive to oia and to the black beaches. They drive like maniacs down there so just be careful and wear a helmet. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. I hope we will return next year for a longer period of time!",1
"My wife and I stayed at this lovely hotel as the second part of our 10th Wedding Anniversary celebrations (Naxos first) and were very pleased we had opted to book this as our choice for Santorini.Pick-up from the ferry port is chaotic as we always find at all Greek ports ... but that is half of their charm of course! The hotel does not have direct vehicle access as it’s a 5 min walk down a path to the main entrance – please note that as with most hotels on the coast there are numerous steps throughout to reach the entrance, reception, pool and all rooms.The welcome we received on arrival from Ioauua, Mary & Eddie was really great – these three as a team REALLY make guests feel that nothing is too much trouble … they just want to ensure you are happy. Plenty of local information is given Ioauua & Mary including a daily Santorini newsletter which we found very interesting.Our apartment was very spacious, well fitted with plenty of storage facilities including small safe. The kitchenette area includes all of the basics and a full size fridge which was much appreciated.BUT … it’s the views that really sell this as an ideal location – the sun literally seems to set on the balcony!All of the hotel areas, the pool & paths/steps are all well maintained and very tidy. Pool and/or beach towels are provided daily – a very much appreciated service.The breakfasts are selected daily from their menu and can be taken either on your balcony or up on the terrace – the view from there with your breakfast is such a great way to start the day!Our thanks to Ioauua, Mary & Eddie and whole team at the Affroessa Hotel for making our Anniversary so very special … we look forward to returning!Martyn & Anne   Room Tip: Room 7 is great!

"Afroessa Hotel was the highlight of our stay in Santorini! We spent 3 nights here while on our honeymoon. Everything from the views, service, hospitality, room, bathroom, food, and pool was PERFECT. It was difficult to leave our hotel room every morning because the caldera view was just stunning from our balcony of room #2. Mary at the front desk was very helpful in giving us suggestions of sunset spots, wineries, and beaches to visit. She also arranged an inexpensive rental car for us with Gem Car Rentals. We explored every corner of the island on our Kia rental! Sunset views from our balcony was SPECTACULAR because this hotel is located near the highest point of the West side of the island. Beats sunsets in Oia without a doubt because Oia is low in elevation and has no caldera views. I highly suggest enjoying one sunset having dinner on your private balcony w/ delicious food from Afroessa's very own kitchen!   Room Tip: Room 1 and 2 appeared to have the most private balconies with better caldera views See more room tips",0
"We just came back from our trip and are still raving about Afroessa! Mary, Eddie and the whole Afroessa team were absolutely fantastic! They were so accommodating and made us feel very welcome.Our room (room 3) had a breathtaking view. There was no need to have to leave our suite and trek to Oia to see the sunset because we saw the sunset every night from our balcony. I'd recommend Afroessa to every couple visiting Santorini!",1
"The very first thing that hits you when reaching Afroessa is the views. The hotel probably has the best views in the whole island and one can spend hours in the balcony admiring them, including the stunning sunsets. Secondly, the staff are phenomenally friendly, kind and helpful. Mary's recommendations of activities (and companies providing them) is great and we have enjoyed every single one very much. Thirdly, even disregarding the views, the hotel is remarkably cute (Ioanna has done an amazing job) with rooms decorated individually and to a high standard.",1
"My husband and I stayed at Afroessa during our honeymoon after choosing it due to excellent trip advisor reviews and it was better than expected! After staying at many hotels, it's so refreshing to stay at a hotel that feels like a home. Our room was very spacious, thoughtfully decorated, had amazing views-so comfortable and relaxing. The staff are so amazing, they treated us with so much kindness and went above and beyond to help us with everything we needed- we truly appreciate their impeccable service and the atmosphere they create in the hotel. The best way to get around stanorini is with a quad bike- it will get you to Fira in less than 10 minutes and all the beaches and Oia without a problem! We found Imerovigli to be a nice, quiet, central point in Santorini. Thankyou so much Afroessa for such a beautiful experience! Hope to come here again one day!",1
"The most beautiful welcoming boutique hotel in Imerovigli Santorini. Ioanna and her team are fantastic, would definately recommend this amazing place ideally located we hired a car but the bus service was great, will definately be going back.",0
"We can't say enough good things about Afroessa and its staff. When you begin to know the staff by name, you know the hotel becomes more of a home rather than just a place to stay. From the moment we arrived, Joanna and Mary saw to it that we had everything we needed. I have Celiac Disease and Spiros and the staff made me gluten free breakfast every morning and delivered it our suite. Eddie is Superman, he carried our luggage up and down tons of stairs with ease, he made us fabulous drinks at the pool and chatted with us when we had down-time. The location in Imerovigli is extremely convenient because it's between Oia and Fira. We were on our honeymoon and stayed four nights. We had room #8 which was a beautiful suite with a private patio just outside the pool. It had an l-shaped couch, a sink and mini-fridge. Although extremely convenient, it's not totally private if people lay in the lounge chairs outside the private patio. The other thing that I loved about the hotel is that some rooms are on the walking path and others are not. As some other reviewers have noted, there are a lot of stairs but that is the case with almost any hotel on the island and the stairs have several levels if you need to rest in between. We didn't eat dinner in the restaurant; however, we did have breakfast in the restaurant on the first morning and we also ordered lunch and appetizers to our room. The food was excellent and I felt very safe eating what Spiros and the staff prepared. There are several places that you can eat at the hotel which makes the experience even more interesting. I can't stress enough the level of service that Joanna and her staff provided - they made and rescheduled reservations for us, they made suggestions for daily trips, they delivered bubbly to us TWICE, and one night I needed medicine and Spiros drove his scooter to Fira to get it for me. If that's not superior customer service, I don't know what is. If we could come back year after year, we would and every time we would stay at Afroessa.",0
"Amazing hotel an amazing place.The view is amazing,the rooms are superb clean and the staff are very friendly. We enjoyed breakfast on our balcony.Airport transfer can be arranged, for an additional fee.Higly recommend!!!!",1
"We just came back from Greece after 3 weeks there (June 17 - July 8 2016). We spent 9 days at Afroessa Hotel. We've been coming back there since 2004 and can't stop thinking about the next time. I guess we've stayed in 6 different rooms out of 10 in the amount of about 70 days over the years... Every time we go back, it feels great! The rooms are beautiful and super clean... The staff are wonderful... The food from the restaurant, made by the owner's son, is amazing! Ioanna, the owner is just magnificent.. She'll do everything for you to accommodate your needs and make you feel at home (away from home). That's how we feel when we are there... At Home away from home...Not suited for kids, that's for sure. Bring your ""other half"" and just enjoy the beautiful view of the Caldera and hear the sounds of the birds flying above your head... Plenty of restaurants around it if you decide not to eat on site. The ""old path"" to Fira, is just there. Take it on your own pace and arrive in Fira to explore the Town. It will take you about 45 mins but, seriously, it's a great walk and beautiful as well. Good to do that before sunset... So you can see it while you are walking on the path that can be 4000 years old. Just breathtaking !!!! Trust me: Afroessa is much more than words! You have to go to experience it in person... We just love it there!!!   Room Tip: If you have a small budget, chose the room number 9 by the pool. If you have a friend or a tenager k... See more room tips",0
"An amazing place to chill out and forget the hustle of every day life.Staff were all professional and very friendly. The hotel is freshly painted every year and the property multi tiered with a pool and sun deck all facing the caldera and it's wonderful sunset views.The restaurant was the real surprise.... Excellent ala carte menu choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner.The Greek salad is probably the best we have ever had and the evening meal special is usually a traditional Greek dish but the menu has other choices should you wish! Spiros the chef is very talented, simple fresh food cooked very well and presented beautifully!For those of you who can't cope without a wifi connection, I am ashamed to confess although delighted to say that the wifi coverage is the best I have ever experienced in a Santorini with routers in every room and every level of this delightful property.Location is in Imerovigli which is a quiet village but only 10 mins from Fira and 20 mins from Oia in a taxi, there are also regular bus connections.Highly recommended enjoy your stay",0
"We stayed in this hotel from Jul 4th to Jul 6th. The view is breathtaking, rooms are super clean, staff are very friendly and helpful, location is amazing. I am super happy that we stayed in this hotel. 100% recommend it, just book it!",0
"What an incredible hotel! The hotel is situated on the Caldera and offers 180 degree views of the ocean and islands on the entire property. Staff is warm, welcoming, accommodating, and helpful. We enjoyed breakfast on our balcony overlooking the ocean every morning and a cocktail overlooking sunset from our room's balcony every night. The pool is one of the larger pools that you'll see. This hotel was recommended to us by friends and we will no doubt recommend it to others.",0
This was an amazing hotel with a polite staff that are willing to do whatever it takes to make you feel welcome and comfortable. The food is five star and the location is perfect. If you have spent countless hours looking for a good hotel look no further. You won't be disappointed. The rooms are amazing but do have a slight musty smell but remember you are in a cave like atmosphere. Leaving the windows open solved that issue for us. Don't pass on an opportunity to stay here.,0
"If you've seen those Santorini pictures of the pristine white-washed villas dotting the side of the mountain, overlooking the deep blue caldera sea... then Afroessa will deliver that dream.Located in the more exclusive town of Imerovigli, it's an entirely different experience compared to what you get in the busier, more touristy areas such as Kamari, Fira etc. We hired a scooter and visited these towns and beaches... and it was so nice to be able to ride back to Imerovigli and Afroessa and retreat to the quiet splendor of a room with it's breath taking views.The accommodation, service, food was superb... it's not often that we cannot point to a single thing that was amiss. On numerous occasions the staff at Afroessa extended themselves and exceeded our expectations.After many years of travelling we are also a bit sceptical of in-house restaurants... but again we were amazed by the quality and presentation of the Lava Restaurant (open to guests only) and found it was as good as, if not better, than some of the better rated restaurants we visited. The Greek salad, Greek breakfast and expresso milkshake were our favourites, along with the pizzas (ask for it to be thin and crispy if you like it that way).Afroessa made our trip to Santorini unforgettable... and it will certainly be our pick when we return again some day.",0
"This was our fourth visit to Afroessa in four years. It never fails to stun us with its amazing views, lovely rooms and the warmth of its welcome. It really does feel like a home from home. I can't praise the staff at Afroessa highly enough, they are so warm, helpful and friendly but are never intrusive. The lunches and dinners at the new Lavas restaurant are also a great addition. It's lovely to enjoy a leisurely glass of wine and meal from the terrace while the sun provides that famous sunset.We can't wait to return to this amazing place next year and to see all our Afroessa friends again.",0
"Afroessa is easily one of the best hotel experiences I have had, even thought it is not a luxury hotel. It's a family-run boutique hotel managed by Joanna(such a gravious host), her family and her team - a closed knit affair. I found them all extremely friendly, helpful and very welcoming. They are genuinely passionate about their hotel and their guests. Our room was traditional style, with air-con, wifi, mini refrigerator, heated bed, iron and toiletries. We had a small balcony but some of the rooms come with bigger ones too. All the rooms face the caldera and hence boast of amazing views of the Aegean. It's a very well-maintained and beautiful hotel. I highly recommend eating their breakfast of Greek omelette on the terrace near the reception. The views and the food are both excellent. Airport transfer(shared shuttle) can be arranged, for an additional fee. They do have a no children policy. Location is simply perfect, between Oia and Fira. It's quiet and peaceful, away from the hustle and bustle but well connected and boasts of stupendous views. I think it's a perfect option for a romantic getaway.",0
"This family run small hotel (I recall 10 suites) is a renovated former winery on the slope overlooking the caldera and with views from every room and terrace. Thanks to prior reviews we knew to ask for an upper room rather than a room at the level of the pool or walkway. Our suite was located above the kitchen and office be we never heard a sound in 3 days. The building is built of thick stone and plaster and the only sound we ever heard was the wind which was constant during our 3 days. There is a furnished private terrace, a small kitchen with everything but a cooking surface or microwave (none of which is needed as the hotel has a lovely eating area, indoors and out, and two of the family are chefs). Our Greek omelettes were so delicious that we ordered them every morning. Breakfasts were generous no matter what else we ordered, the baking was fresh, the yoghurt and fruit were delicious. Lunch and dinner was available with good variety although we found many other restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. The sunsets can not be beaten and one can stroll for many kilometres in either direction from this location. I did and took hundreds of amazing photos. We recommend not renting a car or scooter. Driving, directions, and parking are all difficult unless you already know the island well and don't mind taking risks. The hotel is very good at arranging rides or shuttle and the bus service is surprisingly efficient although takes a little getting used to. The family and staff are wonderful from start to end. We felt pampered and most fortunate to have chosen Afroessa. We will return if that possibility ever arises.   Room Tip: Ask for room not at pool or walkway level See more room tips",0
"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Booking was easy, great communication from Ioanna and Mary. We had the warmest of welcomes on arrival from both of them, and they all made us feel like family (as in they were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us... they didn't make us wash the dishes and take out the garbage ;) We had a room that fronts on to the old path that goes all the way from Fira to the end of Imerovigli and round to Oia. Not the best position in the hotel, as we had people walking past a fair bit, but it made us realise that we had the BEST view on the island (in my opinion)... everyone wandering past would stop, say 'wow' and take photos (of the view, not of us in our room!). Spectacular doesn't begin to describe it, and it was great to be able to step outside and start wandering along the path... this is a must-do, incredible views the whole meandering way to Fira. Our room (deluxe studio) was lovely, beautifully decorated and clean with a comfy bed. Each room has its own wifi router, so the connection was fantastic. We ate at Afroessa's restaurant on 2 evenings, and though the selection of dishes isn't large, the food we had was lovely. Oh and the pina coladas were the best we had on our whole trip (tried ones here, in Naxos and Athens. Afroessa wins!!). The only thing I'd change about our stay is that we were there for 3 nights and should have booked for longer! Imerovigli is in an ideal position in the middle of the island, quieter than Fira, but with great restaurants and a few bars. We'd love to go back to Santorini sometime and would definitely stay at Afroessa again. Ioanna, Mary and Eddie... we miss you!!!",0
"My fiance and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I actually planned the proposal for our second day and both Ionna and Mary were immensely helpful in securing reservations, making arrangements, and storing the ring for me. Eddie was friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Santorini is a wonderful place and staying in a beautiful, friendly hotel like this made it even better. Thank you to all the Afroessa staff for your help and hospitality!   Room Tip: Make sure to get an ocean view. They will bring breakfast up to your balcony where you can enjoy a s...

"This hotel is truly spectacular. The view is AMAZING, and the staff is more than welcoming. The owner greets you personally, and the entire staff gets to know you by the end of the trip, always interested in making you feel at ease and with great recommendations. (Shoutout to Eddy, best bartender ever.) The location is, according to us, the best one since you are between Fira and Oia, in a very peaceful village where you can just relax and enjoy the view. They arrange transportation from and to the airport (you have to pay for it, though), and print your tickets for you. The rooms are comfortable, the pool area perfect, and the food just like in a top-notch restaurant. Do not have any complaints, would definitely stay here again with friends or for a honeymoon.",0
"Afroessa has such great reviews on tripadvisor for a reason! My husband and I booked the hotel for our honeymoon and from booking to departure our stay was positively flawless. 5 star service is provided by all of the employees. Booking was easy online, I had to add an extra day at the beginning due to our flight change and that was easily accommodated by the staff. They arranged our taxi pick up and drop off for us (25 Euros each way). The front desk assisted us with booked an ATV to drive (a must do!) and booking a catamaran cruise around the island. Room was clean, large, had a fridge and a small freezer, and daily housekeeping was excellent. Towels for pool/beach provided. Pool was lovely. View was great. We didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant but it looked lovely and often had other guests there. We had room service to our room a few times and it was prompt and simple. Didn't have a chance to eat breakfast at the hotel but they had some good options, including vegetarian options (vegan may be more difficult). Prices are very inexpensive for the location. Bus stop is easy to get to and hotel is on the main trail. 25 min walk to Fira (capital) and a 2 hour walk to Oia (again bus station is easy to get to and buses are reliable) 1.80 euro bus fare. All around a romantic, quiet, beautiful place for us to spend our honeymoon. I couldn't have asked for a better trip - 5 star service at Afroessa.",1
"Late booking to Santorini, must have views of the caldera and this fitted the bill on paper. On arrival it was better than expected with lovely staff, a fantastic view and a great room just above the pool.Best rooms (in my opinion) are those just above the pool and below the old path.Breakfast brought to the room was excellent value and very good.Big plus was the hotel was near the end of the village so very quiet and not as much passing footfall.Highly recommended!   Room Tip: Below the old path and above the pool See more room tips",0
"I stayed with my mother for a week. This really is a super hotel, whatever your budget you won't be disappointed. The owner has such superb attention to detail, not least in her selection of staff. Service is clearly top of the priority list here and nothing is too much trouble when it comes to making sure the guests have a perfect holiday. The food is delicious, the bar/pool area is comfortable and relaxing, the rooms have everything you need and are kept spotlessly clean. Edi will make you a wonderful cocktail and the cleaning ladies do such an amazing job without being at all invasive. I swear, it's like everyone here can read your mind! The location is great, we walked to Fira two or three times and Oia once. As for the views - well! Best hotel views ever?? One thing you must do while on Santorini in take a sunset catamaran trip, just ask at reception and they will fix it for you. We would have done one every night if we could have!Seriously, just stay here. You will have the time of your life...   Room Tip: We had suite 7, level above the pool, on the left as you go up. It was perfect! See more room tips",0
"Spent two nights at the Afroessa during a week long vacation to Greece. If you want to stay at a very nice hotel, that provides top notch service, then select this hotel. What sets it apart from the others are they make you part of their family, care about your needs, and ""always"" go the extra mile to ensure you get the best service possible. We found this throughout our stay from selecting a tour of the island to breakfast and then at dinner. Instead of sitting back, they treated you special to ensure you got exactly what you wanted. Our room was located along the trail between Fira and Oia...with an extremely beautiful view of the water looking towards Oia and the Greek Islands. It was breathtaking view that we will forever cherish. The room had all the amenities of a regular hotel - small kitchen with silverware, utensils, cups, coffee maker and free bottle of water daily. The wi-fi was secure (to the room only) and very very fast. This was a room with view people only dream about, but in our case came to real life.The provided a $50 voucher for dinner, which we used the first night. I ordered minced beef (a Greek specialty) and my wife Mediterranean pizza; both were done to perfection. It was only rivaled by their breakfast in the morning. We asked to be picked up upon arrival at the airport, and they were there just as we requested. We were whisked to our room quickly which was extremely nice. Upon departure, we asked for a ride to the airport. With a 2:30 pm flight, they arranged for a van to pick us up at 12:30 pm. They helped up get to the pickup point, and the ride arrived exactly on time. Given the small size of the airport, we were at our gate by 1:30 pm with more than enough time to spare.Let me say that Joanna (owner), Mary (receptionist), and Eddie (assisted with luggage coming & going) were the most friendly people that we've ever met at a hotel this size. Their desire to help us with anything that would make our stay better was unmatched. We really appreciate all they did for us.So if you want to stay at some place special during a trip to Santorini, the Afroessa Hotel is the one for you. The will make your stay the best ever!",0
"Even before arriving the staff at Afroessa could not have been more helpful. We had some late changes to our schedule which Afroessa accommodated happily.Ioanna even helped us arrange our transport from the airport to the hotel.As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by Ed who could not have been more helpful throughout our stay. He helped us with our luggage offered us drinks and was always on hand to answer any questions.Ioanna was so lovely and generous, offering us free drinks and desserts nearly every day.During our stay we needed a lot of advice on where to go and Mary was there to recommend and arrange some excellent options. Really couldn't have asked for more from her.The rooms were great, the views were spectacular and the service was the best we have experienced. The food was also a pleasant surprise. Try the Mediterranean pizza!We would like to thank all of the amazing staff. Mary, Ed, Ioanna and everyone else that made our stay unforgettable. We'll definitely stay at Afroessa hotel again when we visit Santorini and highly recommend this place. :)   Room Tip: Ours was room 3 with an amazing view of the Caldera and Skaros Rock, it was right next to the recept...

"We stayed only one night before flying home after a 10 day sail around the Cyclades and so were really only looking for a good bed for the night in a quite location. This hotel is right at the end of Imerovigli and so is very quite. Like all the hotels along the caldera it has stunning views and lots of steps. Our room was at the bottom of the hotel adjacent to the public path that runs along the caldera from Fira to Imerovigli. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with our own little balcony. The room includes a sink and food preparation area with a few basic items of cutlery etc. Surprisingly this hotel has a kettle but no tea or coffee consumables so you will need to buy these from the local supermarket or order cups of tea or coffee from room service at €2.5 each. Our room rate did not include breakfast which we paid for separately at €20 for a 2 person continental breakfast, delivered to your balcony but not before 9:00 am. This was fine but maybe a little pricey for what you get. The receptionist, Mary, is very bubbly and enthusiastic and happy to help with anything you need. The hotel does have quite a nice pool and sunbathing area and a nice large bar/lounge opening onto a terrace with seating for dinner. Overall this hotel was satisfactory rather than exciting and is really at the extreme end of the caldera hotels in Imerovigli",0
"After a lot of research booked this boutique hotel in Imerovigli and we stayed there only for 2 nights since we couldn't get an availability on our third night in Santorini. I have stayed in a couple of 5 star properties as well but never have I recieved the kind of love and care that we got in Afroessa. We were treated like family and made to feel a part of their family. Just to top it all, the view from the hotel is amazing and Chef Spyros cooks really amazing food. being vegetarians - they always came up with ideas on how to make our food innovative and tasty according to our palettes. Their hospitality is beyond imaginable. I have never felt sad to leave a hotel after a holiday, but this time was different. Each and every person on the staff - Mary, Xara, Edi etc were always smiling and concerned about our well being. There is no doubt that when I go back to Santorini - that is the place I will stay. We have come back making connections for a strong friendship. I cannot rave enough about the brilliant experience we have. My husband said - this is absolutely another definition of hospitality altogether. Never could I have imagined this level of care. A must stay when in Santorini!",0
"This is the first review ever I gave full stars to a hotel, especially looking at all the score categories. The staff was brilliant and Ioanna, our host, took so much care of us and invested so much of her time to ensure that we do not only have everything needed but that we feel great too.Location is perfect, away from the hustle of the main streets and swarms of tourists, yet at a very romantic point with stunning views and on the trek from Fira to Oia. The view from the terrace is breathtaking.Anything we asked for we received, Ioanna and the staff planned the programme for our stay with us, took us through the options and arranged everything with the local operators, be it transfers, car hire, catamaran trip, winery visits or excavation visits. They recommended very good yet affordable wine and cooked us a dinner even outside of the normal hours.The room was spotless, bed very comfortable and still one has a feeling that the accommodation is traditional, in the cave houses dug in the volcanic ashes.It is still cold and windy at the beginning of May, warm clothing was a good choice.All in all great value (the romance, the hospitality and authenticity) for the money. If you book direct through hotel webpage you get €50 voucher to spend on dinner or wine and this value takes you a long way in Greece nowadays.   Room Tip: We booked the Deluxe Studio with private balcony, yet all the rooms have stunning view at the sea an... See more room tips",1
"We stayed here for 5Nights earlier this month and absolutely loved the whole stay. The Host & Staff was very kind and friendly and always went extra mile to help up, be it arranging a taxi at midnight from the airport to casual dinnertime conversations. They really put a personal touch to everything they do. As per the hotel itself, its on the edge of the cliff overlooking the volcanic island and the sea in the charming village of Imerovigili. The whitewashed walls and cozy interiors adds to the charm. All the rooms are on the cliffside so all of them have either balcony or patios plus you have the outdoor terrace to enjoy the views while you dine.You can get one of the best sunset views from imerovigili and from this hotel right from your balcony :) Afroessa gets a 5* from me. Expectations surpassed.. Couldn't recommend enough.",0
"I can not think of any place I would rather arrive after 24 hours of traveling in cars and on planes. We came here to start the celebration of our 20th anniversary. Everyone made us feel immediately at home. Although we made some plans online, Mary was able to give us some great information about activities around the island. Our unusual circumstances allowed us to stay in three of the hotels rooms and we would have been happy spending our entire stay in any one of them. Although there are several top rated restaurants in the area, we found ourselves most happy at the hotel restaurant which devotes all of its resources to giving their guests the best experience. The restaurant is not regularly open to outside diners. There are really too many great things to describe but one of our favorite attributes of the hotel was the peace and quiet. We also loved being right on the path that runs from Fira to Oia , (pronounced E-ya)   Room Tip: The hotel is a bit off of a main road.I would suggest contacting them in advance to arrange an easy... See more room tips",1
"There are so many things to love about this place. The staff is all top notch- kind, responsive, and helpful. It was the best service that we had in Greece. The location is great too- we were happy to be in Imerovigli only a bus ride or long walk to Oia. This was a quieter place to stay- I would certainly stay in Imerovigli again, and would choose Afroessa.My only recommendation is that they bump their reasonable price a few Euro and include breakfast.If you're looking for a hotel that stands out, book here! We loved our room #2 with our balcony!",1
"This is a little removed from the crazy part of downtown Fia. Makes the walk there more fun though as it is mostly downhill. The staff is very friendly. I was the first guest of the season and they were busy painting everything. The room was small, but was built in a wine vault (or something) So lots of character. Very cool which I imagine is even nicer in the heat of the summer. You can not see the center of the caldera, but you can see the sunset. The balcony was private, but you can hear everything happening on the cliff at adjacent properties also. They bring breakfast and dinner right to your balcony. Very very nice.",1
"Stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days during our honeymoon in Greece in June 2015. The check in was smooth. Stayed in the Deluxe Studio room, although it was not a modern swanky room, it had a character of its own. There was living area, bedroom and a small kitchenette and a balcony with breath taking view of Caldera- truly magical. We use to have our morning breakfast on the balcony and its was really romantic. The morning breakfast is not complementary but it's is very reasonably priced. Thee pool looked really inviting. The person at the reception helped us to book the sunset cruise and did advice us when we asked for any little help. The hotel staff are polite and helpful.It's a paradise for honeymooners. We had amazing time here with great memories to cherish forever. Nice little boutique hotel.",2
"The three days/two nights we have spent here were very memorable. Santorini is an amazing destination, something that should be on everybody's bucket list. Having said that, it is a very touristy place, incredibly busy when the cruise ships are there and crawling with American tourists on daily basis, boasting how many times they've been here before - this made me think 'right, this is the first and the last time I'll want to visit Santorini, so I better try and see whatever I can'.Afroessa has a great location, it is about 40-min walk from Thira (and a 5-min walk from Imerovigli restaurants) and offers stunning daytime and sunset views over the caldera towards Thirasia and Oia. The hotel is nicely tucked into the cliffside and offers cave-like accommodation, meaning it's pleasantly cool. The build is traditional, very unique indeed. Our room had a nicely sized bed, with candles at the bedside, there were also slippers and robes, AC unit, hair dryer, safety deposit box, even an iron and ironing board, as well as a kitchenette with plates, cutlery and a fridge (a free bottle of water included). The fridge did produce terrible humming sound so we had to keep it shut off during the night - hence had issues with keeping the drinks cool. The shower was fantastically practical, a slight downside was that the water was boiler-heated so you need to switch it on half an hour before intending to take a shower. Luckily it's the sort of destination where there aren't really any beaches so there's no need to keep washing salt water off your body (sweat is another matter). Each room had a terrace or a balcony with table and chairs, there was also a small but deep pool with loungers and a bar on the main terrace. Was a bit compact, but cute and functional. There was free wi-fi with each room having its own router I believe.The staff was very friendly and caring, Greeks are natural hosts. The owner so often described in these reviews is indeed very gracious (only realised who she was based on other reviewer's comments here).The only two hiccups we had were: 1) transfers: we could not locate the driver that was supposed to be picking us up - everyone charges the same so in the end it doesn't matter who you travel with (when we finally arrived at the hotel we got a partial telling off by a receptionist lady that we then never saw again); on the way back we were left standing in the sun for at least 15 mins waiting for the driver who was running incredibly late to pick us up, and 2) the restaurant food just wasn't at par with others in the area, I can't put my finger on it, but wasn't as good as elsewhere (I'm impressed with Greek cuisine). The management cared enough to offer a free ice cream and if I remember correctly, we haven't been charged for the dish that my partner had not enjoyed at all. So hands down for the fair treatment one gets, cannot fault the Greek hospitality at all.Breakfast on the other hand was very good, they were also kind enough to swap coffee for a larger glass of fresh juice. Greek yoghurt with honey is amazing.Overall, great location (please note the taxi cannot drive up to the entrance so travel as light as possible), amazing views and excellent service. Definitely worth a visit.",3
Me and my wife were here in october 2015. it was our honeymoon. we flew to santorini from athens and the moment we were at the hotel we were in awe. it is the exact kinda view u would like to wake up to everyday. simply magnificent. is very windy all day. mary and eddy we very hospitable and made our stay really comfortable. the rooms were very neatly kept. breakfast was sumptuous. also it is very close to fira which is the spot to have food and hangout. so apart from travelling to oia for the sunset u don't have a lot to travel. mary's suggestions about the travel places also helped a good bit. the pool is not large but just about enough. its is like this perfect little hotel in the perfect honeymoon destination.,1
"After a very rough travel schedule including flight delays and re-routes, we finally arrived to our destination 7 hours later than planned, after midnight local time. No problem for the hotel, as Eddie stayed later to meet us and carry our bags to our room, where a bottle of wine was waiting for us. In the morning, we were treated to a wonderful view from our room's patio area near the pool. We spoke with the staff in the morning and they were extremely helpful with helping us plan our stay, including a wine tour, catamaran sunset tour, and excellent restaurant recommendations. They explained how to take the bus to Oia, and tips for what to do and where to go once we were there. We ate breakfast at the hotel everyday, which was excellent. We had a few dinners at the hotel as well, and really enjoyed both the food and the excellent view of the sunset. It was a short 5 minute walk from the hotel to a convenience store and bus stop. Eddie also served as the poolside bartender that week, and helped make our stay even more enjoyable. We definitely enjoyed our time at the Afroessa Hotel, and would recommend it to anyone. Excellent service, nice rooms (with fridge for water/wine), perfect view and great location with easy access to the rest of the island. We couldn't ask for anything better, and would definitely stay here on a return trip. Thank you Afroessa staff for a wonderful stay!   Room Tip: We had the room on the pool level with the sectioned off patio area, and it was wonderful. Easy pool... See more room tips",7
"Me and my girlfriend visited Afroessa for 2 weeks in August. From the very beginning we were made to feel very welcome and we're helped from the car park to the hotel by Edy. All of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and have no issue in advising or assisting whenever needed. The hotel is beautiful and without doubt have the best views from the swimming pool balcony. The rooms are very nice and tidy, the swimming pool area is perfect for relaxing as it's very quiet. The location of the hotel is one of the best and can easily get to other areas of the island via public transport. The food in the hotel is very nice and we stayed in the hotel and watched the sunset over dinner a couple of times and the prices for food and drink were very good. We will 100% return to santorini in the near future and to the hotel afroessa. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. We couldn't fault the stay or the trip. We would like to say thank you to everyone who made us feel welcome and see you soon. Edy if you are in London let me know.",5
"Affroessa is our little slice of heaven in Santorini. From the morning we arrived till the day we left, every moment was absolute perfection.Our arranged transfer was easy and the driver dropped us off near the hotel where Eddie, one of the staff, helped us with our suitcases.When we descended the steps to get to the reception area, we held our breath to soak in the landscape of the island. The view was breathtaking! It literally was heaven on earth.Ionna and Mary welcomed us with the utmost hospitality. Every question we had were answered and they gave a few recommendations on what's best to see and do on the island. They also booked a couple of dinner reservations and the boat trip to the caldera for us. Our deluxe room was spacious and well appointed. We loved waking up to the spectacular view of the caldera. After a long day, we enjoyed having a glass of wine and relaxing on our porch to watch the sunset. The hotel also had a decent size pool, a bar and a restaurant on premises. We had an excellent stay at Afroessa Hotel that we are planning to return to Santorini real soon",2
"First let me start by saying our overall experience here was wonderful due to the location of the hotel away from the hustle and bustle, amazing views, clean rooms and grounds. The pictures truly represent the property. Now for the few things that you should be aware of. If you are an early riser and wanting breakfast or at the very least a cup of coffee then you will be disappointed as there is none available until 9-9:30am. When we walked around we saw other hotels having coffee available. I booked this hotel over a year before our arrival and based on the fact that we love spending time on the balcony I requested a certain room with a large balcony and it confirmed with the hotel twice before arriving. Well they gave one of the rooms with the smallest outdoor space, barely fitting two chairs. When I mentioned the mistake to the front desk I get all sorts of excuses including we didn't want to inconvenience another guest who requested the same room a day earlier. She said she would have the owner come talk to us about this which she did but never mentioned anything about correcting the situation. At that point I decided to accept the smaller room and see if she would offer something else in return, but nothing. To me this was very disappointing at the time and decided not to get upset because we were just starting our fabulous vacation and let it be. But I feel it's worth mentioning in this review. There are far too many other hotels and choices all around the island so choose carefully. Yes this is a very very nice place for the price but they did not treat us like valued clients at the time given that situation.",1
"As a single ‘solo’ traveller I wondered how it would be staying at Afroessa and making my way along the typography of the various steps and paths from Imerovigli through to FiraSs and onto Firostefani… but I need not have worried. The welcome I received from Mary in reception and Ioanna was kind and reflected a genuine wish to know their guests, providing suggestions on outings and timings to reach the main towns of Fira and Oia. First, a welcome drink on the restaurant terrace overlooking The View over the caldera – yes, I know you’ve seen the pictures, yet you will be mesmerised towards the blue sea and the trails of the boats making their way to and from the ports; trust me, it can be very easy to spend all your time in Santorini just gazing at this!Then, with luggage already whisked down the steps to my room, I found my room, a lovely double bed studio which opened directly onto the pool deck. Tastefully decorated with Greek hats on the wall, shutters on the window and the door, there was a small ‘kitchen’ area – with a fridge, plates, glasses – although not a means of cooking or heating. Immediately outside by the pool is the poolbar from which meals and /or drinks can be ordered. Just one small piece of advice – do be prepared for the variable quality and nature of the steps and pathway along the caldera…. some parts are tarmac and painted to match the adjoining hotels decor and style, others are steep uneven steps with netting and scaffold pole alongside an ‘unoccupied’ piece of land… whilst other have carefully plotted cobbles jutting out of the sand, designed to trip up your sandal! Thank you Mary and Ioanna for your lovely and welcoming place. You make a real difference – and I can say this with authority because although I only stayed 2 nights on my outwards journey to Paros and Antiparos, I did stay in Imergovli again on my return… when the personal touch of Afroessa was definitely missed.",2
"Recently stayed at the beautiful scenic Afroessa hotel in Imerovigli, Santorini. We are 2 middle age couples on vacation and we were looking for a friendly yet quiet place to stay. Our transportation was organized and went very smoothly from the port. We were warmly greeted by the staff and they were so helpful during our 3 day stay. The view from this hotel is outstanding and indescribable. The sea and the volcanic mountains are picturesque as seen in the photos. The owner Johan ensured we had everything we needed and more. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The pool is perfect with comfy chairs surrounding it. The day we were leaving the island, our departure was later in the day and we were able to use the pool, shower and bag storage until we had to leave. That was very helpful. We cannot say enough positive things about the Afroessa. We felt welcomed and they made us feel like family. Can't wait to return. Merci Johan and staff.   Room Tip: All rooms are interesting.

"We absolutely loved this place! The entire staff was spectacular. The location was perfect for my wife and I. A short walk to great restaurants and a longer one if you want to go into the capital...but why would you IMO. Views are to die for as everybody says but another secret is their own little restaurant. We had the best grape leaves ever and other snacks. Big lunches and light dinners made this work perfectly for those nights.Mary gave the best restaurant advice as well...the walking was the only thing saving me from putting on 5KG. Definitely will be back.   Room Tip: go for the best room available...all are nice, we stayed in two diff rooms and liked them both, but... See more room tips",2
"The only drawback to an otherwise superb hotel were five flights of stairs between the terrace pool and the entrance to the hotel.This is because the hotel is wonderfully located on the top of the cliff overlooking the bay and fantastic views of sunset.The staff were courteous and ever helpful.It was quiet and peaceful - just what we wanted.Although we hired a car for two days out of the six we stayed to give us some flexibility, bus transport around the island works .There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance   Room Tip: Room 10 is smaller than most of the others but was fine See more room tips",0
"This hotel is at an excellent location. It's at the highest peak of the mountain, so you get an excellent view of Santorini. The view from the hotel is really breath taking like everyone says. It's about a 30 min walk to Fira or 5 min walk to the bus station. The people working there are very nice. There are many steps up and down, but there are steps to every hotel you book in Santorini. The room we booked was a little dated but for 100 euro, I wouldn't complain since we didn't spend much time in the room. They clean the pool everyday. We actually went to check out other pools at other hotels with higher ratings on tripadvisor but their pools are not as nice.",0
"From the moment we went through the gate and walked down the stairs to the reception area all my dreams came true. The hotel and the staff are beyond wonderful. I was so overwhelmed by the magnificent view that I began to cry tears of joy. Joanna, Marie, Hara, Eddy, Dora and Joanna's son(I'm sorry I forgot his name) were ALL so kind and helpful. The Hotel was immaculate. The food was delicious and the village of Imerovigli is peaceful and was centrally located. I wish I could have stayed another week with these warm, friendly people at their lovely hotel. We were on the ""GO"" everyday and didn't spend enough time at the hotel and the extra week would have been wonderful to be able to enjoy the spectacular view and our outstanding accommodations.",2
"This property has it all, fantastic rooms, incredible views, and wonderful staff that will make your visit to Santorini truly special. My wife and I along with another couple spent 4 nights at the Afroessa in mid September and we definitely feel that we made the right choice. Do not miss the opportunity to try Chef Spiros dinner creations or Eddies Red Vodka cocktails, you will not be disappointed.Thanks to Mary for offering the shawls so we could enjoy our late evening dinner on the deck overlooking the caldera. They were a big hit.Finally, thank you Ioanna for making us feel special and not just a room number. It's the many little things that you and your staff did that will make us remember this trip forever.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Afroessa in early August during our visit to Santorini and thought the accommodations were wonderful. The hotel is located down a small quiet street and the views are just wonderful from all areas of the hotel. The room was spacious and had a fabulous patio that we enjoyed seeing the sunsets from. If you are looking for a calm and relaxing experience, this hotel is perfect. The only slight downside of the hotel and Imerovigli in general is that you pretty much need to stay and eat in the few restaurants in the area because getting to Fira is a bit difficult and getting a taxi home at night is even more difficult. Imerovigli is however much more peaceful than Fira and Oia, so it depends on what you are looking for. Joanna, the owner is just wonderful. You can tell how much pride she takes in the hotel and is very willing to accommodate every request and make sure you feel at home during your stay. The pool is very relaxing and we really enjoyed the small bar where we eat lunch and had drinks each day. We will definitely be back soon I hope! Thank you Afroessa!

"We spent 10 night in this gem during our honeymoon. The location is in a calm part of Imerovigli (which is also calm compared to Fira & Oia) and after travelling around the island we're quite certain that the Caldera view is best from Afroessa. The hotel restaurant i brilliant, we prefer it over many of the other restaurants that we tried and which all are top ranked at TripAdvisor.All rooms have balconys and Caldera view, and we spent quite a lot of time on our! The room was beatiful and cosy, perfect for the romantic holiday! The pool area was stylish with cooling water temperature and a bar for ordering food and drinks (and yes the Caldera view is spectacular here aswell!).Finally, everyone in the staff was really kind and helpful. They were constantly eager to make our stay great by providing execellent service, sharing tips and always with a friendly smile!",0
"This hotel is with no doubt your best choice to stay in Santorini. First of all, the location is fantastic. It is not as crowded and hustle as Oia, not loudy as Fia, this place is quite, great spot to see the sunset. near to everywhere. One of the most tempting attraction is hiking in that famous rock (Sorry I forgot the name, start with letter ""S"" I guess). You have to literally climb up with both your hands and feet. But it is worthy the effort. Apart from all of these, the staffs are extremely helpful and nice. My special thanks goes to Mary. Wish she can have a good vacation with her boyfriend.   Room Tip: Ask ask via email before the trip, they will arrange you the best room within their limits. See more room tips",1
"Afroessa Hotel was everything we had hoped for after reading the reviews. There is a reason Afroessa consistently receives excellent ratings - the owner takes great pride in creating and maintaining a luxurious, intimate hotel. You will be treated to warm hospitality from the moment you arrive from efficient, friendly staff ready to fulfill any requests. Centrally located, you are within easy walking distance to restaurants, markets, local transportation and other services. Oia should not be missed, but we much preferred watching evening sunsets from the peaceful privacy of our own balcony, especially while enjoying delicious, authentic Greek cuisine prepared in-house (available exclusively to Afroessa guests). With comfortable beds and crisp sheets in well-appointed guest rooms, to the pool-side bar and dining room, you will be hard pressed to find a more elegant, professionally operated, lovely hotel in one of the most spectacular settings in the world. Read the other reviews and look no further. You will be delighted when you arrive, and sad to leave.   Room Tip: All rooms looked great, but discuss your preference with the owner while booking.

"Best hotel ever the view is great, staff amazing made a bunch of great suggestions and helped our trip to be amazing. So glad that I chose this hotel. I would recommend.They even helped us up and down the stairs with our luggage. Surrounding was quiet yet close to the city.",1
"Great experience, a hotel with very nice view of Santorini, good for star gazing and sun set views. Staffs are polite and friendly, very helpful too. The restaurant has awesome food, and the happy hour with free wine is just brilliant! We'll definitely choose here again when we come back!",1
This hotel lived up to all our expectations. Fantastic room with breathtaking views and accommodating staff. The room kept Greek touches and was clean and very comfortable. We would return without hesitation .,1
"The staff at Afroessa was great. They were extremely helpful and welcoming, and genuinely cared about their guests. The location was nice as well -- right between Oia and Fira, and very close to the bus stop. Our room (studio with balcony) was located right along the walking path between Fira and Oia: right on the caldera and gave us really nice sunset views.Anogi and Estia restaurants are both very close, and there's a convenience store nearby as well. The other positive is that the hotel partners with GEM rental cars. GEM drove our rental right to the hotel, and allowed us to return it at the airport when we departed.The TV signal was a little spotty, but the wifi was decent. Our room was rather small as well, but we would definitely stay here again.",1
"A lovely warm welcome after our late arrival and a lovely meal. A beautiful location right on the edge of the caldera with stunning views across to Thersia and of course the amazing sunset. The room was very nice and kept by very clean by the lovely cleaning ladies. The only downside was the outdoor seating was at the bottom of the steps to the pool and so not at all private. The pool at the lowest level of the hotel area was nice with ample sun beds and towels provided. The food was good and could be eaten either in your room delivered by Eddie (does he ever sleep?),or in the beautiful restaurant ( have a look at the photos of the restoration). Mary helped us book a couple of trips and looked at the weather forecast to pick the best days( the boat trip was amazing). There are lots of steps, because of the location, but each of the approx 120 was worth it. Joanna should be very proud of this lovely hotel,   Room Tip: The outdoor seating for some of the rooms is not very private room 8 and those on the main footpath. See more room tips",1
"Arriving at the Afroessa is quite an experience - the hotel extends from the street level gateway down five levels of terraces to the pool/bar past the 10 traditionally appointed and charming rooms practically carved into the 45 degree cliff face looking directly at the fabulous sunsets. In fact the views are spectacular all day! So is the welcome from the owner and her small and dedicated team, who make it their business to take care of your every need. Room was spotless throughout our stay and the breakfast on the terrace was a rare pleasure. The hotel is located directly on the principal footpath from the capital Fira to the resort of Oia and is well positioned for local tavernas, bus stops and shops. Room service and food and drinks are available at the hotel all day. Only one word of warning, there are a lot of steps all around the hotels in Imerovigli - the resort is not suitable for the less mobile or small children. For everyone else the Afroessa is a perfect getaway as evidenced by the many weddings and newlyweds who come here for the great photo opportunities and the hotel perfectly set up for memorable snapshots. We would certainly stay here again - booking directly with the hotel was also a painless process.

"Stayed in this hotel on our honeymoon in July. Beautiful location, views were stunning - we had a balcony so could have our breakfast with a view! Room itself was small enough but had a good ensuite and the bed was very comfortable, decent air con too. Lovely pool and great cocktails in the poolside bar. Very friendly staff too. Location was a bit of a walk from the bars and restaurants etc but that wasn't a bad thing for us, meant the place was nice and quiet. In short, we loved this hotel and would happily stay here again.",0
"My husband and I stayed at the Afroessa recently towards the end of our European honeymoon. We had high expectations and were not disappointed. The views from the private balconies are stunning and perfect to watch the gorgeous sunset over a few drinks. The staff are beyond helpful, they really do absolutely anything they can to help. I would definitely recommend you stay here when in Santorini.",0
"This charming boutique hotel was perfect in every way! The views were spectacular (better sunsets than in Oia), the room was comfortable and romantic, the meals in their restaurant were delicious (they even serve breakfast on your terrace), the staff was friendly and gracious, and the quiet location was conveniently within walking distance of all the action in Fira.",2
"Your hotel search is over. This is the perfect place to stay in Santorini. The hotel staff becomes your family and they take care of everything. Ideal location, quiet, but in walking distance to everything needed. Great rooms. Will return!",0
"We stayed both here and Marizan Caves in Oia on our trip to Santorini. We wanted to get a different feel of the island and Imerovigli was a great option for that. Everything about afroessa was positive from my experience. The views are just amazing and we saw the best sunset of our trip right from our patio. Although the patios aren't large, they are perfect for two people enjoying a drink and relaxing. The room was great at afroessa. The bed was very comfortable, the rooms were spacious, and the bathroom was big enough. My wife complained a bit about counter space but nothing to detract from the overall rating.Breakfast was not included but we ordered it one morning and it was well done. The food was good and they had far more options and add ins then most of the included breakfasts that we got at other locations.Extra touches - Afroessa made was feel extremely welcome and made the stay special. My wife and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary early and we arrived to a nice bottle of Santorini wine which we enjoyed over sunset the next two days. Not only that but at check in they gave us both a welcome drink and then while watching the sunset the first night, they gave us each a glass of delicious sangria. Pool - the pool was spot on. The actual pool was large enough for a nice dip when hot after laying in the sun and everyone was respectful of others. The pool area itself was great with a lot of chairs right on the edge for laying out and enjoying the view. Also, the service at the pool and in general was fantastic and the prices for drinks were extremely reasonable.One of the workers, Eddie, was also very friendly and prompt in everything he did from serving drinks, serving breakfast, and making you feel welcome. I just wanted to call that out in case the hotel reads this!Overall, the hotel was great and exactly what we needed. We were bummed to leave Marizan but afroessa made the transition easy.   Room Tip: We booked a room above the pool level. To be honest every room looked good except for Room 10. See more room tips",0
"This was a great find. The hotel had a spectacular view and was walking distance on the cliff trail to local restaurants, stores, more spectacular views, and the island buses. The owner was sincerely interested in our comfort and the rest of the staff was always available when we wanted assistance.",0
"We did not stay here as they were fully booked, but visited several times. The owner is very caring and takes great pride in personal service. We ate here and the food was very good. I especially liked the private aspect of the rooms and the balconies.",0
"We just came back from 4 nights at hotel Afroessa. The location, majestic views, very comfortable rooms and attentive staff made our stay so very memorable. Thank you so much to the entire staff who went out of their way to cater to our every need. We will recommend you to all of our friends who have the good fortune to visit your beautiful island.",0
"What a beautiful place. My fiance and I stayed at 5 different hotels on our recent trip to Greece, and Afroessa was our favorite. The lovely Ilonna and her amazing staff (especially Mary and Eddie) attended to our every need.Sitting on our patio having breakfast, or by the pool having cocktails during the breathtaking sunset made us want to cancel our visits to the other islands and stay longer at Afroessa. We enjoyed Imerovigli and being away from the crowds of the larger towns: We walked to Fira and took the bus to Oia. I felt like I was leaving behind an old friend when I said goodbye to Ilonna. We hope to return.",0
"My favourite part of my whole vacation in Greece was staying at Afroessa. The staff were exceptional, always going out of their way to lift your luggage and bring your meals to your room. The view is absolutely spectacular. We went to Oia for the sunset like everyone suggested but it was so crowded. It was 10x better to watch it from our private balcony at Afroessa, so peaceful and calm. Also Imerovigli was the perfect place to stay without the crowds. Look no further than Afroessa!!!",0
"We travelled to Greece in early August and stayed at Afroessa during our trip to Santorini. The initial reviews on tripadvisor compelled me to book a room at this hotel and so did we. From the time of booking till the time we checked out I must say that the hospitality of all the people involved with this property has been excellent. The location of the property is perfect for a sunset. We have been to Oia for sunset one evening and the other evening we were at the hotel and I must say that the view from the balcony is equally amazing. The rooms are decent enough but I would recommend booking early so that you can request for Rooms 1 - 4 which do have private balconies. We booked a couple weeks ahead and got the last room so didn't have any options. But even that was a nice one too. Breakfast was even awesome. I must say that I felt at home while staying at this property and kudos to Ms. Ionna, Hara, Mary and Eddie and the entire team for all the help during our stay.   Room Tip: Rooms 1-4 provide a much nicer view See more room tips",0
"Afroessa Hotel is a special place. It's pristine view from the cliff on immerovegli is magnificent. The perfect sunset can be viewed from every balcony. The pool is also a tremendous treat because it is both quite large and well maintained. The rooms and all around service are what makes Afroessa truly special though. Rooms are well taken care of and prepared. After staying at Afroessa 4 times, I all it my Santorini home. Everyone at the hotel remembers you after just one stay and truly strives to make your stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. In addition, the hotel offers a great drinks and food that can be sent to your room, the pool, or you can enjoy them in their new dining room. After staying at a few places on the island, Afroessa is the best by far for both the hotel itself and the service their employees provide.",0
"I can not fault my stay here, the staff were so helpful and accommodating.The room was gorgeous and the breakfast delicious, a real luxury to have it in the room!The pool area was relaxing, we would have stayed here longer if they had the availability. A truly relaxing start to the holiday",0
"Everything about this hotel is perfectly charming, with beautiful views of the sea, cozy rooms, and lovely relaxing pool area. Our room had a little balcony area in front with a table that we ate dinner at one of the nights (the food at the hotel restaurant is delicious as well!) while watching the gorgeous sunset over the sea and the smaller islands. The entire staff was also amazing, and we both felt like the owner Joanna went out of her way to welcome us and make us comfortable. We stayed for 3 nights and wished that we'd stayed longer!",0
"When we checked in we were informed that we would be checking into one room for a night and then we would check out of that room and check into another room the next night for the rest of our stay. This was obviously inconvenient. The hotel staff did not seem to think this was unreasonable. If you think this is reasonable to switch rooms after check in then this hotel will be fine for you. We thought it was ridiculous. The first room we stayed in was dumpy. The air conditioner was an older unit that made a lot of noise and the bed was hard which made it difficult to sleep. We moved to a much nicer room. The views are incredible from this hotel. This is a very good choice if you want a quieter place than the more crowded parts of Santorini. Overall, the hotel was very nice and pleasant except for a dumpy room one night and having to move rooms.",2
"Afroessa is a great place to stay if you visit santorini. It's a good escape from the crowd in Oia and Fira. It takes about 15mins if you drive from either Oia or Fira. Taking public bus is another option as well. The room is spacious and clean. The view from the room is amazing. We enjoyed the sunset there. The only thing that needs to be improved is the umbrella at the pool. When it's too windy, the stand couldn't hold the umbrella and it falls. We witnessed it twice in a few hours but luckily it didn't make anyone injured.Overall this is a great hotel to stay! We loved it very much!",0
"Very nice if you are looking for a vacation ""suite,"" but I would want somewhere a bit more romantic and private if I was going for my honeymoon. The bathroom is chic and modern but the shower is plain and there is no bathtub. The private pool is long and narrow--like a large, extremely long bathtub. Our other resorts on Santorini had much more elaborate showers/bathrooms. I did like the Bose sound system in the room that had music ready to go! This hotel has an elevator unlike our other two hotels on the island, which some people may like. This hotel had a fantastic sunset wine tasting event with excellent selections and we really liked having dinner on their terrace at sunset because it was not as windy as other patio restaurants. It certainly is a beautiful boutique hotel.",0
"A great hotel with an amazing view on the Caldeira in Ohia, Santorini. Very attentive service, good food and large choice of wines, in particular from Santorini. An ideal place for a relaxing stay in a beautiful environment.",0
"Such a fantastic place !Spectaculaire situation at the beginning of the village if OIA , with view on all the little houses and the sea . Great service and food , nice rooms and intimacy guaranteed ...dream of coming back , inspired by such beauty !",0
"What a beautiful property! - almost surreal. Everything was top notch. We brought our 2 teenage daughters with us, and though the hotel truly caters primarily to couples, we were embraced from beginning to end. Kudos to Alex the manager who was consistently visible and always had a free moment for a pleasant conversation. Also, John, the concierge, proved generously diligent with working with us for our excursions. I wish I could point out others by name - but there was a waiter at the pool who went out of the way to arrange a special table for dinner on our final night, and a birthday cake for one of our daughters. He always kept a body of rose cold and ready for us poolside. The front desk was so incredibly helpful with scheduling cars and restaurants. One terrific feature is a special mobile phone guests are each presented with upon arrival. With that fun, you can contact the desk at any time. For example, we took a car to the black beach. When we had enough sun and fun, we call the desk on the mobile phone, a car immediately comes to pick us up - likewise for the sunset, etc. Highly recommend staying at the Kirini Suites.   Room Tip: I can't imagine having a bad room here. We had likely 2 of the most basic rooms, and both were o... See more room tips",0
"Had a great time here - we stayed 4 nights at Kirini. It's expensive but you can't beat the location, amenities and of course the service. Everyone was so genuine and helpful. I've never used a consierge at a hotel before and John was so great to work with. He even ran to our room to grab our cell phone at one point!One unique thing Kirini gives us are cell phones so you can call them if you need any help on the island. We found this to be very helpful on multiple occasions.The breakfast is great - fresh pastries, eggs, and other items on the menu. Delicious coffee / espresso and fresh squeeze orange juice. Also loved the rice pudding! I was bummed they didn't have any on our last 2 days since they rotate things out.Pool is great as well as the cabanas. We spent a lot of time relaxing / eating. On our last morning - we had an early 6 am pickup. They brought us a ""smaller"" breakfast but actually carried and delivered it to our room. Again, the service was always great and I know they put a lot of effort into ensuring their guests are happy.Other PROS: Kitty by the pool ... super friendly and hangs out in the morning!We didn't try the restaurant out or the spa. Spa was a bit pricy for what I wanted but I'm sure if you got services there it would have been great.Overall, highly recommend Kirini Suites!",0
the Kirini Suites and Spa is a wonderful oasis. from the moment I walked in and met the manager Alex I felt welcomed. John the concierge was very helpful. The rooms are well appointed--the food (I ate breakfast and lunch) was delicious but this was expected from a Relais and Chateaux property. I had two SPA treatments with Nina and they were both fantastic. Two comments--folks coming to this hotel should be prepared for Stairs and important to organize transportation both ways in advance since cabs are hard to find at night. I really liked the sunset cruise on the Catamaran--I was less enthusiastic about island driving tour--less enjoyable in heat of the day.   Room Tip: get one where you don't have to climb all the stairs See more room tips,0
"I should start by saying that I rarely take the time to write reviews about any of the hotels that we visit but this one is truly different. My wife and I recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and I decided to surprise her with a trip to Greece. Part of the trip included 4 nights in Santorini's Kirini Suites. We have stayed at many great hotels around the world and many of them have been Relais & Chateaux properties. This one, however, is perhaps the very best anywhere. Of course the setting is breathtaking, the physical hotel itself just perfect in its positioning, but there are many other hotels around the world like that. What sets Kirini Suites & Spa apart is the staff and the level of service that they provide. I can honestly tell you, I have never experienced that level of service and attention to detail anywhere else. Every person there from Alex the hotel manager to John the concierge to Stephen, Katerina, Effie at the front desk, Stephano the sommelier, to Demitris, NIcolina, and Alex at the pool and restaurant, and so many others were amazing. There was no request that was too big or too small to be carried out and always with a smile. Our vacation was quickly turned from just a vacation to more like we were returning to our home in Greece with a seemingly personal staff to cater to our every request. Even Egor and the others who transport luggage around (no easy task given all the steps) were never without a smile and a hello. I could go on and on but will give you only one example of the level and quality of service and follow through. On our first day I had mentioned to John the concierge that we loved the hotel and asked that should we decide to return some day was there a room that was a bit more private. His answer was of course. Within what seemed like 10 minutes, Alex the hotel manager appears and says that he has a room that he would like to show me that was a bit more private. I said our room was very nice and already unpacked. He replied, just take a look. I agreed and off we went. The room was even more beautiful and yes more private. Alex said just clear out the safe and we will take care of the rest. In no time the staff had everything moved to our new room and put away exactly as it had been in the previous room. Amazing and not even requested just mentioned in passing. Another time I mentioned to a staff member again in passing that we had seen a fig try on the property and that Maria loves figs. So of course what shows up but a dish of beautiful ripe, pealed and quartered figs. This is the level of service that you can expect at this hotel and these are only two examples. Obviously, I would highly recommend staying at Kirini Suites & Spa should you plan to visit Santorini.   Room Tip: All the rooms have a fantastic view. Some more private based on their vicinity to the stairs as man... See more room tips",2
"This is the first time that I can't wait to write a review for a hotel. I have nothing but incredible things to say about Kirini, and I wish I never had to leave the hotel. I have stayed at numerous luxury hotels around the world: Ritz, Four Seasons, boutique hotels in Europe -- but none have come close to the service and amenities of Kirini. It really is a different type of luxury. John, the concierge, is the best in the business. He hand-picked things for us to do each day and didn't push anything we didn't like. He would offer to come to our hotel room to discuss options so we didn't have to walk the few steps up to the lobby. Diego, the front desk receptionist, became a good friend and took such good care of me and my husband when we arrived late due to a delayed flight. Diego and John also helped with our lost luggage and called the airline to make sure it was delivered to our room the next day. I spent so much time thinking of which hotel to stay at in Santorini -- since there are so many good options. Don't waste your time - THIS IS THE BEST OPTION. It is in Oia which is a touristy part of town, but you never feel it. Kirini feels tucked away but is so incredibly central. We will try and come back every year, IT IS THAT GOOD. Absolute bliss. Wow.",0
"We spend a wonderful time on Santorini and stay at Kirini Suite & Spa. A beautiful hotel with very kind staff, delicious food and a very professional concierge.Fantastic view. Perfect location. Walking distance to the center. We all love it.",0
"We know Santorini has lots of great hotel choices, but Kirini was special, with a home feeling.They offer a different kind o luxury, with very personalized service with very friendly, and always open to chat, staff. They all had great spoken English in addition to other languages. Young team with more experienced managers.The hotel has a great structure, is very small and exclusive. However we noticed that some rooms do not offer enough privacy (those located on the stair way to Oia village). Our room was great, but with a small, glassed door and windowless bathroom. Great balcony, but with no privacy. Flawless housekeeping. Simple, but tasteful decoration in the room and around hotel common areas (as you would expect in Santorini). Beautiful SPA. Overall maintenance was great.The hotel pool area is not very big, but the pool is very nice. We felt uncomfortable as to reach the only WC close to the pool we had to cross the restaurant - so you have to be conscious to change before... The only restaurant is poolside located and offer a few of light options during lunch, but with no daily specials. Some local inspired dishes, but not too many. Two negative issues at the restaurant area should be highlighted: (1) as it is too close to the pool, with not enough separation, it may be bothersome for both pool and restaurant guests; (2) the outside seating is too warm during sunny days - they should definitely invest in air conditioning or better roofing plus improved vents. During dinner the restaurant menu is improved, but also with no daily specials - food was very good.The best way to get from airport is to book a shared transfer as it is much cheaper than private options. Do not expect to find taxis.We were surprised that you may reach the hotel rooms without any 'hotel gate' from Oia village walk/stairway. I hope they had not faced any safety issue so far, as everybody could reach your room door during the day and night. Point to be analyzed.We would recommend them to better explain to customer their pool 'rules' as some of the guests were somehow too pushy for reserving sunbeds and also inviting outsider to join them by the pool (something that shouldn't be allowed). The hotel is small and exclusive and every guests should respect other guests and the only way to assure that is a clear message from the hotel, with no exception (also making sure all staff members assure that).We will come back for sure! Highly recommended!",0
My partner and I stayed here for four nights at the end of May/beg June. We highly recommend it. This time of the year is just hot enough and not too busy. A short walk from Oia old town. The views were purely breathtaking and the breakfast wonderful every morning. The staff really went the extra mile and nothing was ever too much trouble. I had a treatment in the spa (full body hot stone massage) which was amazing. The restaurant is also worth a try - very special indeed. Thank you for making two stressed Londoners really 'relax'.,0
"Absolutely stunning place. Attention to detail was second to none. Staff were amazing and attentive. Even to the extent when a college drop a phone over the cliff edge and they retrieved it... Can't fault this hotel. Clean, relaxing and would definitely return if I could afford it again.",0
"Thanks to the Kirini Hotel for a very enjoyable stay and a 5 star world class hospitality experience.We were spoilt and cared for extremely well and it felt as if nothing was too much trouble. From the excellent and most friendly waiter Alex, to the most fantastic bar tender Dimitris (his creations are a must try particularly the strawberry daiquiris) and the fabulous food cooked by the young and talented chef Xaris Nikoloyzos this Relais Chateaux Hotel really stood out for its high quality of food and hospitality. A must try is the tomato risotto at lunch. We were very pleased with our room number 12. The hotel is beautifully decorated and with extremely clean finishes with an emphasis on white linen furnishings similar to the Italian Designer Gervasoni. Slight issue with the shading of some of the sun lounges after 3pm and only a few sun lounges maximize on the stunning ocean views. Also wasn't fond of the bright yellow chosen for the towels i would have preferred a more mellow grey... But aesthetics aside and if you wake up early and get the beds with the good view you should be fine. Also it may be me being pedantic but I would prefer salt water to a chlorine pool as the Splendido in Porto Fino offers. Nonetheless this hotel after viewing others in Oia is definitely without a doubt the nicest. Close second is the sister hotel Katsikis... But its louder and more centrally located in the tourist hustle and bustle.Did not like the look of the hotels Andronis or Mystique. We left the Kirini sad to be leaving behind new friends as the staff had become to be like a small family. We also really liked Milos the cat.We look forward to visiting again soon.",0
"Where to start!The hotel, staff, rooms, spa, ambience are just amazing. There is really nothing i can fault about this hotel from the moment you step foot in reception to the moment you have to leave.The attention to detail, the attentiveness of the staff, they think of things just before you are about too but without being over the top and in your face.Then you have the 'wish' phone as we named it which you are given when you check in with all the important staff/hotel numbers on speed dial, so from lounging by the pool you can have swimwear and suncream brought to you from the hotel shop to booking a heli with concierge.It is simply a fabulous hotel with fantastic staff which make you feel part of a family.",0
"I was fortunate enough to celebrate my one year anniversary here with my husband last year and it was an unforgettable experience. The views are to die for and I would come back in a heartbeat! The breakfast was mediocre but the salads at lunch were delicious and healthy. I cannot comment on dinner as we were always out in the evenings. The hotel is in a great location, just a short walk from the main town which is a plus! All in all a great stay, I hope to be back one day!",0
"Great service (including John the concierge).Beautiful hotel with everything you could possibly want including spa, gym, restaurant, big pool, privacy, large variety of choice for breakfast.Amazing views!",0
"We very much enjoyed our stay at Kirini. The service is fantastic - friendly, attentive, and prompt. We were upgraded to a honeymoon sweet which was amazing, with a terrace and a pool. The hotel's position gives it a great view of both the rest of Oia and the islands in general - we were really happy and comfortable. Great bedding and bathroom as well. Thanks!!",0
"Everything was perfect, from the time our driver picked us up at the airport, to check-in, and a welcome tour of the property. The staff is always readily available and Alex, the GM, is always looking for any opportunity to make the stay more special. He even arranged to have the chef prepare moussaka for us one evening because we had been looking for a place that served it. The dining at Kirini was the best that we found in Santorini, so no need to venture out for lunch or dinner. The flavors and unique dishes were outstanding.We plan to return at a future date.   Room Tip: The Honeymoon suite with a private veranda and Jacuzzi can't be beat. Very private and nice to... See more room tips",0
Exclusive service. Exclusive location. Thank you Alex for your welcome and making this trip perfect. This was the perfect hotel for our 6th wedding anniversary. Great food at the hotel and the city is just 5 minutes away and offers many restaurants and shops.,0
We were in Kirini for the last 2 days of our trip to Greece for our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel made special preparations for us for our celebration. The staff is very polite and friendly. The facilities are gorgeous with beautiful views. The food is amazing. The rooms are very comfortable. Thank you Alex for everything you did for us. We will highly recommend this hotel to all our friends.,0
"Went there in August for a few days with my wife and the trip was close to a nightmare, On arrival the room we got checked in was not what we had booked after complaining we got changed to the room we had booked. Hotel is nice but the service offered there is not what we expected: food at the hotel was very average, all the restaurant we got advised to go were not good",0
"I stayed here with my parents (65+) for 4 nights. We had an absolutely wonderful time! The trip was a birthday present for me and the Kirini Resort and Spa did not disappoint! The room and view were beautiful and the staff went out of their way to accommodate our (sometimes picky) requests and never made it seem like we were a burden. In particular, Olga and Alex were absolutely phenomenal and arranged dinners and a wonderful yacht trip for us. When they found out it was my birthday they even arranged to give me a complimentary massage. Overall we couldn't have been happier with Kirini! The only thing we felt could be improved upon was dinner at the restaurant. While I appreciate fine dining and molecular gastronomy, it would be nice to have the option of a more simply prepared locally inspired menu in such a beautiful setting.   Room Tip: great views, amazing service, beautiful hotel See more room tips",0
"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. A perfect combination of impeccable service without any intrusions. The best breakfast buffet spread of any hotel I have experienced. All of the staff reply to every request with, ""Of course"" and sincerely want to make your stay perfect. A special shout out to the concierge, who spent a good twenty minutes early in our stay finding out what we liked to do and making the perfect suggestions, including a few non-tourist eating spots and three specific dishes to try at one of them. Yes, it's expensive, but truly worth every penny. Also, a perfect location at the edge of Oia, instead of right in the middle of it all. Totally private and just a ten minute walk into town. Five nights spent in heaven on a spectacular island in the Aegean.   Room Tip: The lower number rooms have public porches on the walkway up to Oia. See more room tips",0
"Very spacious room even in the junior suite. Highly attentive staff and modern (if small) gym. My one piece of advise to hotel staff would be to provide unlimited bottled water to hotel guests free of charge. The tap water is undrinkable, yet paying 5 plus euro per water seems unnecessary. I would highly recommend this property for anyone traveling to santorini.",0
"A beautiful boutique five star hotel on the edge of the caldera. I stayed with my husband and two children (17 and 15 yrs) for a week. Without exception all the staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. We were looked after so well. From day one, everyone addressed us by name and spoilt us. All the rooms have stunning views across the caldera. Delicious molecular menu for dinner by the pool, plenty of choice for breakfast. John, the wonderful concierge helped us with ideas for dinner restaurants in Oia and with directions to other island attractions. My daughter and I had massages with two very professional masseurs and came away floating on air! Recommend the Harmony Massage. Fantastic hotel, fantastic location, we couldn't stop staring at the view. A perfect half term break in the hot sunshine. Only negative is there aren't enough sun loungers for all the guests so if you turn up round the pool after lunch, there isn't one for you. One day a stand up row occurred between two groups, one of whom claimed the other had moved their towels!!",0
"We had a fantastic stay at the Kirini. It is stunningly beautiful, set in the cliffside in Oia. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. The service is great - everyone went out of their way to make us comfortable which isn't always easy because my husband is very particular. Alex helped us see the sights, the waiters at breakfast accommodated our special requests and Olga was all-around wonderful. The only downside is that we weren't crazy about the dinner offered at the restaurant. The menu is a little too trendy. What we really were looking for was fresh food - fish and sales and vegetables - rather than a complicated menu. But the breakfast is great and we were in walking distance to many good restaurants.",0
"Myself and my husband have just returned from a truly wonderful stay at the Kirini Suites and Spa, for my husbands 60th birthday celebration, the hotel is like paradise on the picturesque island. Well situated, within easy reach to the airport. The staff are undoubtably some of the finest we have ever met, nothing is too much trouble, they go out if their way to make your stay perfect. I would recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a romantic stay with first class service splashed with luxury. We would like to acknowledge in particular Alex the manager and John the concierge who is a mind of knowledge giving fabulous restaurant recommendations in the imminent area. We would definitely return to the hotel should we find ourselves in Santorini again. Thank you Kirini Suites and Spa! Janet and Keith.",0
"Luxurious Kirini Suites and Spa is a member of Relais & Chateaux with very high standards. My wife and I toured the spa and she wished that we had more time to enjoy a treatment.We dined at Anthos Restaurant on our wedding anniversary and it was better than we could possibly imagine. We were in good hands with Konstantinos, our server. His food recommendations and timing were spot on. We were in heaven with the Spinach ""Pie"" prepared by Christina, kitchen cook. It was divine and I had to compliment her after our meal. The ingredients included Baby Spinach, Fresh Goat Cheese, Dill, Filo Crust & Sesame. My wife enjoyed Scallops with Santorini Fava Beans, Apoxti, Orange Beurre Blanc, and Black Garlic - amazing! My main was Red Mullet and Greek Truffle. This was also an incredible dish. Our ""Volcano"" dessert was an assortment of ice cream and sweet berries prepared at our table by Chef Harris. Chef is very passionate about his job and we were very pleased with his work.Alexandros Karagounis, Kirini Suites Manager, came by our table to introduce himself and to wish us a happy anniversary. He also gave us a tour of the property and we were very pleased to have this attention. Kirini is a beautiful hotel.",0
"I stayed at this amazing hotel with 3 friends for a pre Birthday girls trip away. We can not thank enough All of the team for their friendliness, attention to detail and service, nothing was too much trouble. Stunning rooms, good food, the most incredible views and all with a fantastic five star service. The location of the hotel was really good too, a short stroll from the centre of Oia. Oia itself a lovely town, very picturesque, with some great restaurants too. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. We really couldn't fault our stay at the Kirini Suites & Spa - we left wanting more! What more can I say.......",0
"We already had high expectations of this hotel given the Relais Chateaux accreditation, but were still blown away by the stunning environment and wonderful service! The hotel is perfectly located on the cliffs of Oia, with unbeatable 270 degree views of the ocean. One unique point is they're one of the only three hotels in Oia with a lift, which was much appreciated given all the steps around Santorini! Rooms are new and spacious, with a large bathroom (with Apivita and Bulgari amenities) and terrace for reading and sunbathing. The infinity pool is beautiful (even though it was a bit too cold for swimming) and you can see the famous sunset from the pool area. Wifi was patchy and kept disconnecting, not sure if this is an issue with the network or the hotel. Oia is a short 5-10 minute walk away, it's true that there's no pedestrian sidewalk (for a part of it) and the two-way road is narrow but that's just how things are on Greek islands. I would much prefer this location with a bit more privacy than being on the main street in the centre of Oia. We didn't try the restaurant for lunch or dinner but breakfast was of a good quality, with some made-to-order hot options in addition to the breakfast buffet. They could have changed the items in the buffet though so it wouldn't be repeated on consecutive days. Alex (GM), John (Concierge) and the front desk staff were warm, helpful and made us feel at home right away. John offered good suggestions on places and restaurants to go in Oia and around the island. We also saw Alex around the hotel almost every day and he would come greet us personally, which is rare for a GM, and gave it a nice personal touch. You could tell that he really cares about each and every guest. All in all, a terrific experience which is ideal for special occasions and a romantic holiday! Thank you again to the team for your hospitality!",0
"First of, I'll name some things that we enjoyed. The room was beautiful and clean. The view was also beautiful and you could watch the sunset. Also, the rooms service food was great and very tasty.Unfortunately, the bad outweighed the good. My husband and I stay at a lot of five and four star hotels and this one not one of them.Starting out badly, over the period of multiple days, we had no response from the hotel regarding arranging our transfer from the airport. Finally, the day before we were to arrive, I sent them a message on Facebook and then they finally replied, claiming that our emails went to their spam folder. That’s weird since I’d been emailing them for months regarding different things like restaurants and never had an issue. For this, they did give us a free room upgrade and transfer upgrade. Before arriving, I was happy to put the bad feelings aside since I could see they were trying. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, nobody was there to pick us up. We finally had another nice driver call ours for us and he was running late. We waited about 15 minutes before he arrived saying the hotel never told him it was am airport pickup.When we arrived at the hotel early, our room was not ready, which was fair enough. We then asked for a map and directions to Oia. It was clearly stated and drawn on our map by the front desk clerk that we were to “go to the main street and turn right. You’ll find the walking path into town by the church with blue domes. Always walk with the sea on your left-hand side and you’re going in the right direction.” WRONG! We spend an hour wandering around before giving up and walking in the other direction and made our way to Oia. He literally gave us exact opposite directions so after that, we really felt that we couldn’t trust the front desk to give us good information.Also, our room wasn’t even ready two minutes early for us. We’d been up since 3am and really wanted to relax. I’ve never stayed a hotel, after getting there early where they did not have the room ready for us at least a little bit early. The woman that said she would come get us when our room was ready, after telling us that it would be soon (it was 1pm and the normal check-in was 2pm), earlier than 2pm, never came. We waited until minutes after two and finally had to go looking for someone. We met up with a manager and he was the one bright spot for the workers at this hotel. He was friendly and helpful.At breakfast, which had a nice array of baked goods, we had another bad experience. We sat down with our items and had a server come up and ask what we wanted to drink. We told him and he said he would get the drinks and be back. He never came back. About 15 minutes later, my husband got up and got me a different drink but he never even got his orange juice the entire time we were at breakfast. And we never saw him again and he never apologized.The location was OK but not great. You were close to town but had to walk along a busy street with no sidewalk to get there. Also, the hotel made a note for you to not bring any food or drink into the hotel because they have everything for you. Sure, if you want to pay 6 Euro for a small Coke, when you can walk LITERALLY across the street to the market an buy a larger Coke for 1.20 Euros. I’ve also never stayed at a hotel where they tried to force you to buy their items. Every other hotel had no qualms about you bringing in food and drink and would actually direct us to a grocery store. This included ones that had restaurants and mini bars like this one. We stayed here for our 4th wedding anniversary and were hoping for a great, romantic getaway and this is not what we got. It was a hotel trying to be four/five stars but its workers are not trained well enough for this yet. It was very disappointing the first not happy review I’ve had to leave. I would not come again with the standards it is at now.",4
"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and it was wonderful!! We arrived late in the evening...without one of our bags. Creasa welcomed us very warmly and gently, but firmly, told us not to worry. She assured us that they would take care of everything...and they did.We woke up the next day to discover that the bag was on its way to the hotel. We also saw THE MOST AMAZING VIEW! Views everywhere on Santorini are spectacular, but Kirini truly sits on a special spot on the caldera. While we were in a basic suite (the room itself was quite small, but clean and very comfortable), it still had its own patio area with a beautiful view. The breakfast and pool area views are breathtaking.Speaking of the breakfast, it's delicious, and there's something for everyone. We only ate two meals per day the whole time we were there because the breakfast was so good and plentiful.What really makes Kirini special, though, is the service its staff provides. They are efficient and helpful, with characteristic Greek warmth and hospitality. They really deserve the Relais and Chateaux honor. Thanks very much to Alex, the hotel manager, and John, the concierge, and all of their staff for a lovely time!! We already want to come back!",0
"There is probably very little to add to the comments from fellow travellers but I think the secret of Kirini is the staff who truly own the right to wear the Relais & Chateaux badge with pride. Alex as GM leads a truly professional team whose function is to give you the best holiday possible, for him and the team no request is too small, no question too stupid. Special mention also must go to John the concierge who not only identified for us several great restaurants but showed us a wonderful private spot for watching the glorious Oia sunsets away from the crowds. Reference also to the cleaning staff who work incredibly hard to clear up after us (rania). Alex appears to take a genuine interest in guests welfare and along with the team is truly interested in giving you the best hospitality. Couple of small suggestions include strengthening the wifi signal which drops in and out regularly (which may be a locality issue rather then a hotel one) and varying the breakfast menu. It's possible to order 8 different variations of eggs (which gets a little dull after day 4). It is possible to order other things but this is perhaps not highlighted to the guests as well as it could be. Would revisit and highly recommend.",0
This place is amazing! They truly deserve their Relais & Chateaux status. The resort area and our room was always kept super clean. The indoor spa pool was fantastic and you can reserve your own private session at the pool--truly romantic. The outdoor pool was also phenomenal. I highly recommend this place the next time you are in Santorini. Can't wait to go back!,0
"Great service from everyone in the hotel. uper clean around and great maintenance of the surroundings plus a fabulous view. Loved the indulgent breakfast which made me put on a couple of extra kilos and the delicious smell of their sheets =)I however thought the spa charges were a little bit to prohibited; i have visited many 5* hotels around the world and always had massages but had to pass them this time for finding a 50 min massage for 140€ a bit too expensive. It would also be an extra essential bonus for the guests not getting charged for the mineral water when using the gym facilities. Apart from those 2 points , it was all great.",0
"If you're traveling to Santorini, then the reviews you've read about Kirini are all true - it's a wonderful property, in a gorgeous location staffed by wonderful people.On arrival (hard to find btw - they can't put a sign out of the road because of Oia's Unesco status and so we had to drive up the down the road a couple of times before ringing the hotel, whereby Vasilis came out to guide us in!)A tight (but free) car park - we had hired a small i20 Hyundai at the airport and as I drove on the tight winding roads, I was grateful it was a small car - we got into the hotel and were welcomed with a refreshing cocktail, an engaging update on all things Oia by John ""the Dutchman"" (!) and a room upgrade from Alex the manager - happy days.The room was beautiful, with a Jacuzzi inside and a plunge pool out on the large balcony and an extremely comfortable bed, all of which was kept very clean by a team of gracious and highly efficient cleaning ladiesBreakfast was delicious and one of the best I've had in any 5 star property around the world; some real imagination at work here with a selection of savory and sweet items that changed each day and that I can't even begin to describe, all topped off with a selection of omelettes and juices to satisfy the most discerning palettes.The view from breakfast each morning was amazing and that's one of the key aspects of Kirini - that view of the Caldera, from your room, from the breakfast table - it's awesome in every aspect.Plenty of steps up and down to get around this hotel so high heels are out the question in Oia unless you want to invite an accident.A couple of points for management's consideration;1. I appreciate you get to book the whole place off for yourself but please drop the charge for water in the gym.2. Please consider a film / movie channel in English that remains permanent in those 15 channels - I know we don't go to Oia to watch TV but it was cold in the evenings (in April) and it was nice to curl off in bed to watch something after a nice day out...I've stopped watching the news a long time ago and so what you've got available at present didn't cut it for us (albeit it's fair to say that management went out of their way to help me configure the smart TV in the lounge to stream netflix, which, after an hour of messing with, I finally got working, thank you for that! :-)And that's it - everything else, the setting, the wonderful staff, the breakfast, the room, the atmosphere, it was all wonderful and met with or exceeded our expectations in virtually every way.Thank you guys, I wish you a great season ahead!",0
"I have just returned from a 5 day break with my daughter at Kirini Suites. This was simply THE most idyllic experience. What sets this hotel aside from the rest is the service, location and food. We loved the fact that the hotel was small and from the minute we arrived it felt that we were valued. All the staff without exception were fantastic and they all went that extra mile to ensure that our stay was a wonderful one. Waiter service was excellent. Housekeeping was topnotch. The assistance from the concierge was invaluable and tailor made for our requirements. It's those little things that the staff did that make the difference. We always felt that the high standards that this hotel sets were being monitored and maintained. A managerial presence at all times striving to maintain those high standards. Superb.The panorama from the hotel and room was the best I have ever encountered. It was a view that will always remain with me. The cuisine was wonderful - an amazing choice for breakfast. Everything was freshly prepared. We enjoyed delicious lunches too. This hotel has so got it right.",0
"I stayed i this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is very well located in Oia. Oia is the best part of the island to stay. All the staff group are impecable! Five stars! The concierge is a gentleman and doing everything to make your stay perfect. Near the hotel are located many good restaurants and stores where you can buy souveniers. The room is very confortable, big and clean. This is a five stars hotel. I hope I can return in the future!Thanks for the kirini's team.",0
"My wife and me stayed at Kirini for one week. One of our best vacations. The Staff are very attentive, friendly and helpful. Hotel Manager Alex top of the top. Concierge John best recomendations what to do and where to go. Restaurant manager and staff makes any wish come true. Food and cocktails five stars. Best views in Oia. The suits are big, nicely decorated and comfortable and very very clean (thumbs up for house keeping). Definatly coming back. Thank you Kirini!",0
"Just returned from 2 weeks at this amazing hotel. Once, cave houses, it has been, over the years, transformed in to one of the most quirky and fascinating places we have ever stayed. You want for nothing here and are made very warmly welcome by Alex, and John, Hotel Manager and Concierge respectively. The views from our suite were breath taking and every day brought fresh beauty. We thank Alex, John and all the lovely staff we met for making our holiday one we shall treasure for a very long time and, who knows, we may yet return one day to this wonderful hotel.   Room Tip: Higher floors mean less steps to climb to street level. See more room tips",0
"Best Experience ever. SO wonderfull we didn't even felt like going outside of the hotel although Santorini is one of the best places on earth. The hotel is magic, a piece of heaven and the staff is outstanding. They are polite and friendly and happy and they walk the extra mille for making you feel like royalty and in heaven. Thanks Cristina and Kayerina for making our stay one of our best memories ever. We got an upgrade to room 34 which had private pool. It was AMAZING! our own solarium and pool to play around with the most stunning view. Its totally worth to spend some extra money and spend one night in this room it is a once in a lifetime experience. The suite is beautiful, cool modern design clean and white and sexy. The playlet was amazing. The people that work at the hotel was amazing even the laundry service was amazing.The Food was a piece of heaven. everything tasted so wonderfull. The risotto was the best i ever tried and explosion of flavor in my mouth. we even went to the kitchen to congratulate the chef and got a picture with him. Totally worth eating at the restaurant even though you are not staying at this hotel. It has an amazing pool and view and the food was the best i ever had. The waitress was super friendly i think his name was Pericles, he even recommended us some places to visit in our way back to Atenas. Thanks to everyone for a wonderfull experience!!Arturo, form the bar had the best drinks and is an outstanding photographer. He got some amazing pictures of us in the hotel pool and during breakfast. Thanks Arturo you are an artist. Breakfast was the best i ever had by the pool. They have private pool and spa that is super nice and sexy.I think i can t say enough good things about this place. Totally recommend it. its expensive but its worth every penny, if you are in doubt do it you won't regret it ;) We had dinner one night at Katikies, the fix menu experience. it was supe nice and i recommend it to do but we were happy with our decision of kirini over katikies though it was more popular. its a beautiful place but it seemed less Home i can't find the words but Kirini was a magic place with magic people. One of my top places i ever stayed.",0
"Truly the most stunning place, wonderful staff, lovely rooms with comfortable beds, great breakfast, I could go on....but what let's it down is the loud music by the pool every minute of every day...This afternoon I did ask for them to turn it down and they did...for half an hour. Then it was like we were back at a rave! It's the only thing that lets this place down as everything else is wonderful.",0
"We stayed here on our honeymoon last year and it was truly amazing - I can't say enough about how good it was from the attentive service to the amazing food and views. Yes, there are a lot of steps but that is everywhere in Santorini and the walk to town is fine and far from treacherous - do not believe everything you read from other reviewers. The only slight gripe is the pool and sun bathing area can get a little busy so it's not as private as some honeymooners may like - it wasn't an issue for us as we were given an upgrade to the top room in the hotel (34) which was simply stunning with it's own pool and day beds - why we were upgraded I do not know (we were on our honeymoon but so was the rest of the hotel) but it really made the trip even more amazing, I only mention the pool as I did here some others moaning. The concierge Roxanna and the head barmen Arturo are also deserving of special praise - they really helped to make our trip seem personable and special, Roxanna was amazing helping us book tables in restaurants and just generally hanging out - this place truly is a one off!!

"When you have dreamed of visiting a place like Santorini for so long, the image we create in our imaginations can be so much better than reality. However, when we first arrived at kirini suites I knew that reality was going to exceed my imagination. Alex and his staff greeted us with a refreshing drink and showed us to our room. The whole hotel is gorgeous - so chic and white but never cold or clinical. Immaculately maintained. The staff are, without exception, the nicest and friendliest team we have ever met. Exceptional. We were fortunate to be able to try two rooms during our stay. Room 3 and room 23. We loved them both. They both had stunning views and were beautifully furnished. Large bathrooms and private terrace or balcony areas with plenty of room. Room 23 was the bigger suite with a sea view jacuzzi and walk in wardrobe, double sink in bathroom, with bath and rainfall shower. On arrival you are given a mobile phone to use during your stay. A great little touch. The food at the hotel is amazing. Lunch can be eaten around the pool and the menu is very tempting. We also had a wonderful meal on the eve of my husband's birthday. The chef created my husband's favourite dish and we had a divine cake too. Breakfast was delicious with a wide range of dishes in the buffet, including pastries, bread, cakes, fruit, yoghurts and a hot menu to choose from. I tried several of the hot dishes and they were delicious and beautifully presented. The hotel has a gorgeous pool and comfortable double sunbeds for relaxing on and enjoying the stunning caldera views. Oia is renowned for its sunset views and the hotel offers the perfect viewpoint. It's easy to walk into the heart of Oia from the hotel and there are so many boutiques, restaurants and cafes. Our favourite restaurants in Oia outside the hotel were Ambrosia, Sphinx and candounia. One of our favourite cafes was 39 steps - it has a great view and a friendly welcome. Kalderimi sells some gorgeous linen shirts and shorts for men. Kirini suites have some beautiful pieces by Melissa Odabash. Take flat shoes with you as there are steps everywhere and you will be able to enjoying walking around much more. I found my Toms perfect as they are lightweight and comfortable. You can walk down to Ammoudi bay and enjoy eating at one of the restaurants there. We visited at the start of the season and only one was open called Ammoudi and it was delicious. We also walked to Fira one day from the hotel along the coastal footpath and it's sensational. You do need good shoes, I was fine in Toms. Alex can tell you a way to do half the journey by cab if you want to avoid the more strenuous part of the walk. It took us two and a half hours to complete. We then took a cab back to kirini for just 20 euros. Alex is full of fabulous suggestions for places to visit. He gave us some wonderful itineraries to follow, including a stop at a winery which we highly recommend. We loved having our hire car which we picked up from the airport, but you could manage without a car. Driving was easy though. I didn't want to leave. Santorini is a magical island full of such friendly people. Kirini suites is idyllic and I can't recommend it highly enough. Go. I promise that you won't be disappointed.",0
"Came here last year as their very first guest of 2015. Could not say anything but it's really awesome! The view from the hotel of the Aegean see is magical.Would definitely recommend this great place to anyone. You will not be disappointed. Indeed, a first-class service!",1
We spent 5 nights at Kirini after carefully researching hotels in Santorini. This resort was absolutely breathtaking. The staff was amazing! We felt like we became friends with them! We especially loved Roxy who helped to make sure our visit was extra special. The waitstaff was fantastic and the room was perfect. We had a room with a private pool in the room. The food was excellent as well as the drinks. The only negative was that the drinks were VERY expensive.,1
"Me and my boyfriend were there in August. It was really like I died and went to heaven....We had the junior suite and it was more than we could imagine with an amazing veranda...waking up to that spectacular view every morning is a dream coming true :) Billys and Chryssa at the reception were helpful and kind always ready to assist us in every single thing. Athina at the restaurant always recommended what we could eat and always it was simply tasteful! Gianna at the spa has divine hands :D The hotel is marvelous not only for the location but for the people as well, the hospitality of the greek people is amazing! I would like to give a special thank you to the beautiful and kind Christina, the manager of the hotel, who made our stay in Oia unforgettable. I will definitely return :)",1
"Santorini is spectacular, and Oia is (IMHO) the most beautiful part of it. Kirini offers five star comfort just on the edge of Oia, but far enough away that you don't have loads of people walking in front of your windows constantly. The rooms, facilities, esp food, and even more especially the staff were really special. We stayed at beginning of Oct 15, in two rooms, and couldn't find anything wrong.   Room Tip: If you could find a way to stay in a room away from couples on their honeymoon that would probably b... See more room tips",1
We visited Kirini Suites 3 years ago in September we just returned for a cruise. I must say this was an amazing experience. The staff/ the location/the view / the food all amazing. I am so happy I was able to relive my memories of such a perfect resort.,0
"Loved this hotel, superb location. Friendly staff, very helpful. Great food, enjoyed lunch and very good breakfast. Good pool. Upgraded on arrival. Short 10 minute walk into Oia. Amazing views. Would 100% recommend.",1
"This is what hotel service is all about. Fantastic crew of people from all over, not just doing what is needed but showing genuine enthusiasm and a degree of professional friendliness. Beautiful hotel, great attention to detail, and of course mind-blowing views across the caldera. This is what you come to Santorini for. Excellent food and again great service in the restaurant.Perfect in every way? Of course not, but nothing that is at all important unless you are a serial complainer. Building a hotel on the lip of a caldera will involve steps (108 to be precise from room to front desk), but at least it gives you a quick cardio workout before the next meal.",0
"If i go back to Santorini, I would only stay here. The property is beautiful! Breath-taking views from everywhere. The service is excellent. Friendly helpful staff. The food is delicious. The property is walking distance from town.",0
"Imagine sleeping soundly on a giant marshmallow in a cool, tranquil white cave. Visualise art on a plate that tantalises & satisfies the most discerning tastebuds. Think about being nestled high above the twinkling sea, watching the sail boats heading for the sunset. Contemplate courteous but discrete service by immaculately presented, polite, eloquent, helpful staff. Dream about sipping bubbly in a small but heavenly infinity pool. Picture classic simplicity in an architecturally unique grotto. Marvel at the panoramic views with the picturesque village of Oia as a dramatic backdrop. Touch the soft white linen. Breath in the subtle fragrance of luxury toiletries while soaking in a big bath that is carved out of the rock. Smell the Nespresso coffee wafting from your room as you sink into your comfortable patio furniture. Indulge body and mind in a sumptuous spa or boost your energy levels in a personal gym session. Transport yourself to a serene, elegant microcosm draped with vibrant bougainvillea and you will get some idea of the Kirini experience. The only thing that could have added to it would have been George Clooney strolling casually through the door!We were fortunate enough to be relocated in this fabulous hotel, as ours was overbooked, so serendipity played its part here as we discovered something truly delightful quite by chance. It is situated on the outskirts of Oia (about 5 minutes walk) so it is away from the road and therefore wonderfully peaceful. It is worth noting that I've rarely encountered such happy, relaxed and sociable guests as we had the pleasure to meet here. The wonderful manager and her happy team provided the warmest of welcomes and it was immediately evident they are all highly focused on providing excellent customer service. Kirini offers a subtle blend of informality and sophistication for a relaxed but high quality, unforgettable experience. Thank you Roxandra for all the helpful information about what to do in beautiful Oia and to Racquel for showing us the facilities (what a beautiful spa?) and helping us to find our way around. Thanks also to Athena, our lovely waitress and to the charming waiter who was so creative with a camera! Compliments to the chef, a true master of his art - the food was exquisite, loved the carpaccio of squid amuse-bouche; my husband said that the duck was the best meal EVER and he hasn't stopped talking about the stunning bougatsa dish.Not just five but a galaxy of stars for Kirini!",2
"This review is for the spa only - we travelled over from its sister property, Katikies. And it was well worth it. A memorable hot stone massage (with Athena), and a unique space that includes a cave plunge pool and spacious treatment rooms. Don't miss the zingy ginger tea, and don't miss this spa!",0
We have not had a better experience with a 5 star hotel . Extremely hospitable ! Super friendly staff. The view from our room was facing the sea and breathtaking.we were upgraded to honey moon suit for one night also which was very sweet of them. It's a quite pricy but I think it's totally worth it. So I can't wait to come back again sometime soon with my daughter also.,0
"One of the best places I ever visited. Santorini is magic. Pictures and nice photos cant replicate the views and the magic the island provides.Kirini Hotel is the same. We had an unforgetable experience, wonderful staff, the bedroom very confortable and the view spetacular. Thank you Kirini.   Room Tip: The wet suites have an amazing view and a private pool (jacuzzi) that can be a plus to enjoy moments... See more room tips",0
"Put simply I adored this place. Heavenly. The energy is just right, it feels holiday, glamorous, relaxed, and so beautiful. Laying out on the huge sun beds looking out over the pool to the ocean, and views across Oia, is bliss. The sunsets are magical. And the staff are lovely, very big thank you to Christina for looking after me during my stay, and Artur for taking spectacular photos for me to remember the holiday. If you're fortunate enough to end up with one of the Suites, you have a private courtyard looking out over the ocean and can easily spend days on the sun-seat reading and looking at the scenery. Thank you so much Kirini Suites for a wonderful experience.",3
"Service was incredible, property impeccable, meals were world class, and the view from throughout the hotel was breathtaking. I cannot recommend Kirini enough. The hotel manager makes you feel immediately at home and her commitment to your experience is clear from the moment you walk in.   Room Tip: Make sure you get a room with a private plunge pool! See more room tips",1
"Our experience could not have been any better. We stayed at three different 5-Star hotels on our honeymoon and Kirini felt like a 6-Star it was so good.1. Location. Perfect - away from the busy walking track which many of the other hotels are on. View is amazing and you never get tired of it.2. Staff. Fantastic - extremely friendly and helpful and you never feel like you're putting them out. They are there to help and genuinely seem to enjoy their job of making sure you have a great stay. Arturo takes fantastic photos and goes out of his way to ensure you get the best holiday snaps.3. Rooms. We were lucky enough to get the honeymoon suite and it did not disappoint. Hugely spacious, Bvlgari shower gels and moisturizers, private pool and balcony - incredible.4. Main pool area. Awesome. Our private dip pool was great but we still spent time in the main pool area which was never crowded and always had staff bringing out complementary refreshing drinks and cool towels.5. Food. We did the 3-course dinners both nights and it was INCREDIBLE. I have dined in Michelin Star restaurants in both the USA and in Europe but the dining in Kirini was the best I have ever had. In particular the duck main meal was out of this world - no doubt the best meal I have ever had in my life. The fusion of flavours was genius and perfection all at once. The attention to detail and through through all the starters, mains, and desserts really is something else. The breakfast is also excellent and cannot be faulted. Room service for lunch is very expensive though but that's expected.Overall this was the best place we had ever stayed and we will definitely be back. For us it is expensive but worth every cent.",3
"We were here two years ago and had to come back. We were not disappointed. There was something about stepping through the doors that felt comforting. We were assigned Ruxandra as our personal concierge. She was phenomenal. She arranged a jet ski tour (since we did the sailing excursion last time) which was excellent. Every day she checked in with us on what we wanted to do, all with a smile and never intrusive.The sommelier suggested we go to Venetsanos Vineyards which was also excellent. The appetizers we got at the vineyard were some of the best apps we had. We also went to Santo's Vineyards. If you like your wine warm and loud bad music with terrible service, this is a must see. Otherwise avoid and head to Venetsanos. Do yourself a favor and walk down to Amoundi Bay and have lunch/dinner at the Sunset Grill down there. If you do lunch, take the mules up. So much fun.We ate most dinners at Kirini. This was one area where there could be improvement. Each meal we ate was spectacular BUT the menu never changed the week we were there. This isn't new, same thing happened last time. By the end of the week, we had already ordered the meals we liked once or twice. The last night there, Ruxandra arranged an unbelievable meal at a little out of the way place that was fantastic. I said to the waiter, whose mother was the chef, serve me whatever you want, no restrictions. Food was one of the best meals ever. All in all, totally recommend. We met a couple who had been there four times prior to this time and we both agreed we would come back if possible. Truly tough to beat. This is a five star resort.",2
"This hotel is pure class, the views are outstanding and the rooms are classic and simple yet elegant. The welcome drink and tour through the hotel and its amenities was lovely and we had dinner on the first night by the pool at the hotel restaurant which was simply lovely.Currently spending my afternoon lazying by the pool in the very comfortable day beds overlooking the caldera and Cliffside of Oia- which little snacks being bought to me- life couldn't seem better and I can't recommend this lovely place enough!!",1
"Could be the most beautiful place on earth. Only 26 rooms and staff that really gets to know you. The most luxuriest experience one could have. The concierge sets up everything for you. Great food, drinks, the best rooms in Greece. I wish we could have stayed forever!",1
"We just returned from Greece and were lucky enough to spend 4 nights at Kirini Suites. Everything was absolutely perfect. We prefer to stay at smaller, more intimate luxury hotels and could not have been happier with our choice. From the moment we arrived, Christina the manager made us feel right at home, gave us a tour and made us feel welcome. The staff could not have been better and made sure we had everything we need. Our room was beautiful, the view was amazing. Breakfast around the pool looking out over the water and into Oia was fabulous. Make sure to spend some time talking to Arturo, he was great. And make sure to have him take that perfect picture of you by the pool with the view of Oia in the background--breathtaking! We also took advantage of the spa pool, a private indoor (with a window to the outside) pool. No charge for this, but you book it because it is private--very relaxing. Location is perfect, a quick 5 minute easy walk into Oia. An outstanding experience all the way around, would not hesitate to return.",3
"My wife and I have been blessed to stay at some wonderful places around the world, but the Kirini Suites takes everything to the next level. From the check in process to the the amazing rooms and views.The Hotel Staff...... Perfection............ ""They Rock""",0
"My wife and I just returned form our recent trip to Santorini, which was fantastic! The views from the cliffside pool are like no place on earth. We ate a great breakfast by the pool and usually had lunch at our cabana by the pool in the afternoon. The staff was very attentive and very pleasant, which is why we rate the hotel as excellent. The room was nice, but nothing extravagant. The character of the rooms, which are built into the rock is unique to Greece. The one thing I wold definitely change is the windows on the bathroom door. One could easily see from the bed directly to the toilet, with the door closed, so there was very little privacy. The rooms were immaculately kept, with twice a day maid service and new towels. There was a fruit basket and bottle of wine in our room when we arrived. Overall, we had the most amazing, relaxing, romantic week during our stay at Kirini.",1
"We have stayed in this wonderful hotel for the second time this summer. From the arrival until the departure we were treated tremendously well. Olga, Chryssa, Andreas, Vasilis and the manager Kristina do a tremendous job. However, in case I missed a name, I'd like to emphasize that all the employees are very friendly, service oriented and helpful. This is a priceless asset of this hotel.Our days at Kirini started in our wonderful room which was very stylish, all in white and very well equipped. Even though the room was wonderful and always very clean, we didn't resist the temptation to go to the terrace to admire the breathtaking view of Oia, the wonderful city in the north of the Island.Afterwards, we always went for breakfast where a very motivated team of waiters wait for the guests. Very remarkable is the presence of Arturo who has been working at the hotel for 12 years who makes sure first of all, that the guests get the best pictures and afterwards serves the breakfast together with his colleagues Athina, Kristina, Eduardo and Carolina. All we heard from these people was ""yes sir"", ""certainly madame"", ""of course sir"", ""no problem madame"". All in all...the perfect start into the day.On some days, we enjoyed staying at the pool most of the day where the same waiters take care of the guests in a impecable way. The quality of the snacks, which can be enjoyed at the pool, is outstanding as well as the quality of the drinks (with or without alcohol), where Arturo's very famous Arturoska is definitely the most popular dring among the hotel guests.During the afternoon, there is a shift change, however the new waiters team composed by Babis, Chryssa and some other colleagues also do their job very well and made us feel very comfortable.In the evening we once had dinner at the hotel where (needless to say it again) the food as well as the service were outstanding. On the other evenings we ususally followed the hints of the concierge who advised us very good restaurants, which could be reached by an easy walk (Oia) or by quadbike (or taxi) in case the indicated restaurant was outside Oia.During the entire stay, there was literally nothing we could have complained about and leaving that place made us very sad. We met incredibly nice people who work there, as well as absolutely nice guests who mostly stayed less days than we did.We hope to be back next year!",2
"Five stars at all its grace! We stayed for 4 nights. We had the time of our lives! Where can I start? The staff's friendliness? We felt like home. The restaurant gave us the best culinary experience. The room, everything was fantastic! We loved the place and we will definitely visit Kirini again!",0
"We were greeted with the warmest welcome and directed to sit in the lobby, they brought us lemonade took our luggage then came to us with our check ins. We were escorted to our suite and it was absolutely beautiful with lots of space. We had a beautiful balcony over looking the sea and had a view of the infinity pool. Pool time was a great time, a very memorable guy named Arturo made us wonderful cocktails and took great photos of us which made our stay extra special. Overall experience everything was 5star.",2
"My flight got delayed and I lost a connection so I had 2 days to spend in Santorini. I chose Kirini Suites & Spa at the recommendation of another friend who's been here last year. I had a pretty cool time. As far as hotels and staff members go, I only have nice words. I will definitely recommend it further :)",0
"We spent 5 days at the Kirini for a babymoon. From the moment, we arrived everyone was so welcoming and kind (it's actually kind of baffling to read some of these bad reviews!). We reserved a Junior Suite and were happy with the size of the room, outdoor space, and remarkable views. Ask for room #7, if you can! We took full advantage of the hotel and it's amenities. The pool scene was chill, staff went around and provided snacks during the day, and they checked in on us frequently to see how we were doing. Arturo made us great cocktails and mocktails to enjoy and was an absolute pleasure to talk to about family, travels, and Poland. The restaurant had a wide array of options. We loved the Fava Bean salad and various bites. Breakfast was included and is AWESOME! Prices in the restaurant are not the cheapest, but we did not mind because it was fine dining (& its Santorini!). I took advantage of the A.Spa and had Athena for a Harmony massage. She applied the perfect amount of pressure and was well-versed in prenatal massages. It was one of the best massages I have ever received. Ruxi was an amazing concierge. She reserved our Caldera Yachting tour and provided really delicious and interesting restaurant suggestions. She checked in on us frequently and made our stay so pleasurable and easy. We loved the location of the hotel because it was not on the main pedestrian walkway. It was more private and did require about a 10 minute walk to the pedestrian area (with some steps, but, again, this is Oia - the town is built into a cliff!). The room has about 26 rooms, so it feels more intimate than most of the other places in Oia. We can't say enough nice things about this hotel and it's warm staff. We hope we can return soon for another zen experience!",0
"Our time at Kirini was simply amazing. From the moment we arrived we were treated with such care. The manager Kristina greeted us and made sure we had every possible thing we needed. The Concierge, Miscarina (sp?) was absolutely wonderful! She connected us to the best food, fun and real Santorini experience. Then there was Arturo! What can we say about Arturo! He makes the experience. He is the Restaurant Manager who does everything. He treated us like we had been long time hotel patrons, gave us incredible recommendations, and made the most wonderful beverages. The pictures on the website cannot do this justice. The pool, view, rooms and all appointments makes you feel like you are truly in paradise. If you can do it, book Kirini!   Room Tip: I don't think there is a bad room! You should try to get a room with a plunge pool. See more room tips",0
The hotel is very well and carefully designed. The environment was extremely relaxing and beautiful. The only disadvantage were the 100 stairs one had to mount or descend twice or three times daily. The breakfast was excellent as well as the service.   Room Tip: I think that most of the rooms have 100 stairs. See more room tips,0
"This is the second time that we have visited the hotel and it was even better on this occasion. The staff, especially the concierge, the wonderful Ruxandra, gave us a fantastic welcome on arrival. From then, until our departure, they just couldn't do enough for us. The views are amazing as you'd expect, but this hotel also has the attention to detail and facilities lacking in many of their local rivals.I honestly didn't want to leave.I am rarely moved to write reviews as my job means that I stay in hotels every week. Therefore, I am a tough critic. This hotel is truly exceptional though and, having read a couple of poor reviews, I felt compelled to respond as my experience was totally different and in line with the vast majority of the feedback.Believe me this place is a luxury gem and if you're looking to stay in the area - it's the one !!!!!!!",0
"Having stayed here for 5 days and after staying at the 5 star Amanzo'e in Porto Heli, the hotel is every bit both 5 star and a Relais & Chateaux.The signature of the hotel is its staff, who are outstanding, Ruxandra, Christina, Arturo, Athina, each of whom deserve praise for their warm attentiveness and desire to ensure our stay was perfect every way.At check-in, the manager, Christina, responded to many of the criticisms that we at previously read about. She described the layout of the hotel, described the use of the pool, and the not-confusing required reservation for the indoor hot tub.The layout of the hotel is not only NOT confusing but completely logical and ordinary for Oia. The layout gives the hotel charm, which is exactly what we would expect from a Relais & Chateaux.Christina seems to be everywhere at the hotel, greeting and talking to guests and making sure that all requests are met. Another couple that we met at the Hotel, invited Christina to dinner with them. That's not something you'd see at a hotel with less than 5 stars.Ruxandra, the concierge, is incredible, smart, sharp, and witty. Her descriptions and recommendations were 100% on point, Anthos, Ambrosia, Katina Taverna, Candouni were all sublime. If you ask Ruxandra a question, such as ""can we walk from place A to B?"", she'll simply say ""no"". She's direct, which may be what other responders are describing, but as a New Yorker, we greatly appreciated her candor. Also, she is the best concierge that we have ever had at a Relais & Chateaux. Ever.Another example of the staffs outperformance - at dinner, we asked for bug spray, but they didn't have any. Instead of saying ""we don't have any,"" they sent someone to get it. We demurred, telling them it was not necessary to extend themselves like that but nonetheless it came to our table within 15 minutes.I don't know why Anthos is not the number one restaurant in Oia. It would be a 27 Zagat-rated restaurant in New York City. The Tavernas in town are fantastic, but for a luxurious decadent white tablecloth meal, you can't beat it.Arturo, without us asking, reserved a daybed for us. Arturo is great conversationalist and an incredible mixologist. He engulfs the pool with his personality.The gym is small, so that would be one de-merit relative to mainland competition like the Amanzo'e but on Santorini I doubt any one has anything grander.We divided our time between two different rooms, and neither showed any sign of rust or mold. Both rooms were immaculate, maid service was on par for a 5 star hotel.We had long conversations with each of the individuals listed above, and together they are a remarkable staff, exactly the types we have met at Aman hotels, Four Seasons hotels, and all of the other Relais & Chateaux we have stayed in our travels globally.Last night we went to Canoubi (another of Ruxandra's recommendations) with 2 other couples staying at the hotel with us, one from Hamburg and one from London. The couple from London knew the owners of the hotel and within minutes they joined our table, along with another hotel manager from Imerovigli. The couple from London had stayed in another hotel on the island and transferred into the Kirini. Sitting around the table, we discussed the Kirini, and there was consensus: This is a 5 star hotel.P.S. Get a deep tissue massage from Athina, it is the best you will ever have.",4
"There are many things to like about the hotel but when I am paying €1,000 per night, I do not expect a cracked bathroom mirror, rust all surrounding the mirror and sink, mould around the toilet flush and shower controls and peeling paint in the bedroom. Paid another €120 per night for an extra bed for my daughter and it was so uncomfortable, she moved the mattress to the floor. There was a nice orchid in our room but after 5 nights, the flowers had all died and it was not replaced or removed.The pool and pool area were very nice except for the music which was too loud.My daughter and I had spa treatments and these were amazing; best thing about the hotel. However in the gym, a bottle of water cost €5 but was free in the rest of the hotel.The staff on the whole tried to please but were not uniformly trained. I did not like the fact some tried to sell us services which were over priced; example, tried to get us to order the hotel taxi to the airport for €100 and when we insisted on the normal taxi, it cost us €30.Location of the hotel was excellent and although the layout was quirky, it added to the charm of the place.Although there were serious maintenance issues with our room, the public areas were immaculate.There were too many inconsistencies in both the service and the state of the rooms in Kirini that made it such a disappointing experience.",3
"This is a honeymoon-level hotel. Every view from this hotel looks like the beautiful advertisements you've seen of the Greek Islands. The hotel is built right into the cliff overlooking the caldera. When we arrived from 20 hours of travel, tired and sweaty, we were immediately greeted with an invitation to sit down and have cold lemonade while they checked us in. The hotel manager showed us through the entire hotel and provided us with a free bottle of wine, which we cracked immediately as we jumped in our private hot tub overlooking the caldera. We stayed in the room type ""Wet Junior Suite"" and it was really worth it to have our own hot tub on the balcony--instead of going out for drinks, we often just came back after dinner with a bottle of wine we bought at the store (all the wine in Santorini is delicious) and hung out on the balcony. The room and bathroom were huge (by European standards, at least), the bedroom had an iPod dock so we could listen to music, huge comfortable bed. The breakfast was delicious and copious. The view from the pool is unbelievably gorgeous and there are enough daybeds to lay out on that you don't have to feel competitive about getting one. The concierge was very helpful. We also had a couples massage at the spa, which was beautiful and private, one of the nicest spa experiences I've had. Okay, now for a few very small negatives. On the last day, we noticed a large number of ants in our room. I didn't report them because we were on our way out and the cleaners were coming and I figured the cleaners would take care of it, or call who was needed...but there were still ants coming in after that. That really shouldn't happen at a hotel that costs this much, but it wasn't a big deal and I went ahead and just blocked up the hole they were coming in with toilet paper and sprayed it with OFF. I mean, the hotel is built into the earth and, you know, it's Europe and hotels generally aren't super-perfect and that's part of the fun. We also blew a fuse late at night and had a trouble getting someone on the phone to come and fix it, so we had to go looking for them up in the lobby. But it wasn't a big deal either, they came down and fixed it right away. You should know there are a lot of stairs in this hotel that you have to climb to reach the pool, the lobby, your room, which was fine for us, but might not appeal to everyone. Kirini is worth the money if you are looking for real luxury.   Room Tip: Spring for a suite with a hot tub on the balcony See more room tips",1
"We had an absolutely amazing time at the Kirini on our honeymoon. The location overlooking the caldera in a quieter part of Oia really can't be beat. Most of our days were spent reading in the pool cabanas with intermittent trips to the pool to cool down. I could have spent weeks doing that.The rooms were comfortably furnished, and we had an incredible balcony to enjoy the sunset and stars.On top of that, the staff is top-notch. They're incredibly knowledgeable and professional and really made us feel at home.If you're going, I'd also highly recommend eating at the hotel. It's the best food we had on Santorini (outside of Lolita's Gelateria, which is also a must).   Room Tip: Opt for a room with a private balcony. Some rooms are off of the foot path connected to Oia. See more room tips",1
Beautiful and quaint. Just like in the pictures. Just a smaller version of kaitikes hotel which is the first five star hote built in Oia. For sure Oia vs Fira is the place to stay. Unbelievably beautiful. Great service great restaurant. Great suites. Loved it!!,1
"It is a perfect relais chateau very serene, amazing sea view from our balcony, Food was the best I tasted in Santorini , concierge was super attentive and all staff very helpful at all times. i only hoped to have scheduled to stay longer. Most beautiful sunset of my life.   Room Tip: Make sure you get a room not too far from reception to avoid too many stairs or the small elevator t... See more room tips",1
We did have wonderful time when we stayed at Kirini in June. Pretty view from our room and great breakfast and great service. My wife also had nice spa there! We will come back in the future when we return Oia Santorini. Strong recommend!!,1
"We stayed 3 nights at Remezzo's Honey Moon Suite, a fabulous gigantic cave suite with very beautiful santorinean minimalist decoration and a gorgeous and huge bathroom, carved in the cave. The bathroom is open-through to the room, having just a nice seamless curtain to separate the divisions. The living room has a king size bed, two nice santorinean sort of sofas and even a mezzanine with fridge to allow us getting at easy with own snacks and drinks. The suite courtyard is really huge, with direct astonishing views to the caldera, whilst being very Private and very cosy. It has sun beds chairs and even an astonishing big hammock to allow being really lazy in late afternoon. But the utmost experience is watching the sunset laying in the suite's king size bed, as by a very fortunate coincidence the suite is perfectly oriented to the caldera sunset!!! Really unbelievable ! The family hotel service is very personalized, with guest being asked by the name, and with no need to sign room service bills! Owner Vassilis and staff Cristina and Anthony are very attentive and engage friendly with guests, like if we were part of the Remezzo's big family. In summary, we had a memorable and fabulous experience at Remezzo's. Vasco and Evanthia",0
"Where do we start!On arrival we were welcomed with a drink on the house and had a nice chat to Calypso about the island, she gave us a map and pointed out everything to do.Secretly my Dad had arranged flowers and fizz in the room for us which was perfect start to our honeymoon. Later we went to meet Vasilis we had some restaurants in mind but in the end went with their suggestions, Vasilis has been on the island since he was a child and I can confirm everything he booked for us was outstanding! Everything was arranged all restaurants and activities within about 30 minutes. Remember to eat at the hotel also!!We was a bit hesitant on driving on the island, atvs seemed popular but Vasilis ensured us it was easy so we opted for a smart car for a couple of days which was much more comfortable and safer to drive. As we were rubbish with maps we downloaded an offline map of Santorini and it was very easy to get around the island and to the hidden non tourist spots suggested by Vasilis. Defiantly worth it!!Our room was perfect a clear view of the sunset from our balcony that also had a private outdoor hot tub we actually never made it to the pool as the room was so Perfect!Breakfast was 1st Class, about four courses and different breakfast items served each day. Calypso told us her father who owned the property found it hard to get a good breakfast at hotels during his travels,this is why they offer such a great service and items on the menu, it is truly amazing and even the chef came out to check if everything was OK!Rooms were cleaned twice daily, and were totally immaculate, beds sheets turned down at night with a little sweet on your pillow! So thoughtful...One day my fiancee was sick and they went out of there way to cook something she could eat and get medicine! Remezzo to the rescue she was alive and kicking within 24 hours!Location wise we loved it, 25 minutes walk into Fira and some of the best restaurants and views on the island are along that walk. Fira and Oia were perfect to visit but to stay would of been to busy for us. We found in imerovigli the best point on the island not only for the sunset but for everything else. For us it was perfect!We love that remezzo is family run even the son is doing the dishes and makes the coffee at breakfast! We stayed at another part of the island after this stay and you can really tell the difference. Remezzo care and They make you feel part of their family.. We wish we never left.We will defiantly be returning",1
"Went to Santorini for one week for our 1st wedding anniversary and wanted something special...views, pool, cave rooms and wow factor. Even though this is a 3 star hotel it is more like 4 star!! I don't normally stay anywhere less than 4 star but the reviews were so good we decided to book this place. Was not disappointed. They arranged taxi to pick us up from the airport. 20 min drive from airport (€22) . Guy at the other end waiting for us to greet taxi and take our luggage. At reception Christina was there to greet us and offered us a welcome drink of wine/beer and at the same time gave us an overview of the island and where to visit on a map. Very welcoming ! As soon as we got there was wowed by the views...overlooking the Caldera and just what I wanted in the style of the hotel. We were shown to our room which was by the pool (room 4) and was large..walked into a large seating area with two sofas , small kitchen (with pots, pans, crockery etc) and separate room with bed and big bathroom with large jacuzzi bath/shower and twin sinks. Cave rooms. Very impressed. And had the best sleep ever here...very quiet and cool (have AC in the rooms). Our room had its own sectioned off entrance with two chairs and table ..perfect for breakfast! Pool was average size..can do small lengths and perfect for dips to cool off. 6 sun loungers and 6 very comfy chairs to watch the sunset...perfect views to watch sunset...over wine (or champagne ) and nibbles. We did this on many a night. I would suggest they buy perhaps a couple of more sun loungers as on a couple of occasions people had to sit on the chairs as not enough loungers or even lay their towel on the floor (one French family was hogging 4 loungers even though they were hardly by the pool together and never used all the lounges ie huddled on two or in pool but did not give up the loungers...you know the type...who get up early to put their towels on the loungers!!) The breakfast have great reviews...we had the bfast one day...not buffet but table service comprising many courses...OJ, coffee, cakes and pastries, and then 3-4 courses...not too traditional western bfast dishes but very nice. For the remaining days we made our own bfast in our room (eggs and bread or just fruit and granola). Lots of super markets nearby to buy breads, meats, cheeses and salads. We hired a quad bike for 24 hours which we would highly recommend as it's the best way (or car) to see the whole island - was amazing! Vasillus recommended a few places to eat, including Francos cafe in pyrgos.Vasillus helped my husband arrange champagne and flowers on our anniversary! On our last day, our flight was at midnight and we asked if we could have a later checkout and Christina said she would try. We checked out of our room by 11am and lay by the pool...to our surprise Christina said she had another room available for us and led us to another room ....it was amazing...directly on the cliff overlooking caldera with private heated Jacuzzi pool and sun loungers. The room was great too - room 13. Made me want to stay longer!! They allowed us to stay there until we had to leave for our flight...that is what I call service! And that wasn't all...when we went to check out and pay, they only charged us for 6 nights and not 7 - our flight out was delayed a day which meant we arrived a day later than planned hence they didn't charge us for the night we didn't stay...wow wow wow. We didn't expect that as the room was reserved for us and not their fault we didn't use it. But that is the service you get here. Housekeeping come twice a day and give clean towels daily...they do a great job...place is spotless! I would highly recommend you book this place...don't hesitate, you will love it. Imerovigli is perfect location..,Fira is too touristy and Oia attraction is the sunset which again is crowded and we had best views from Remezzo! Imerovigli is perfect in between the two ...30 min walk to Fira. Lots of amazing restaurants within minutes. Book it!",1
"Thank you Christina and all at Remezzo for a fantastic stay!! Highly recommend this great property! View is stunning, food is fantastic, staff is so helpful and generous with their time and suggestions! Thanks so much and YES we will return one day!!",0
"These villas are truly beautiful and the location is great - staff were amazing My only two complaint is that the pool is WAY to small and they desperately need a lift or something to allow ease of getting your luggage to and from A bit expensive For the size of the rooms , whilst they are beautifully appointed",0
"This hotel has everything you could ask for. Vassilis and Christina were friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating hosts. The views of the caldera from your room are amazing, and the sunsets spent on our balcony was just as stunning as the ones we spent on the south side of the island or Oia. The breakfast is something that should not be missed - an amazing start to your day. After exploring the island, I'm glad I didn't break the bank on a hotel located in Oia. I think spending a day there walking around was sufficient, and I prefer the calm that came with staying in Imerovigli, which had a number of great restaurants within walking distance. It'll probably be a long time before we venture back to Santorini, but when we do we hope this place is still here.   Room Tip: The suite with a hot tub was worth every penny. See more room tips",0
"Stay here! Everything is perfect. They make you feel like family visiting the island. Best sunset right from your room or pool. The manager could not have been nicer or more helpful. Everything he told us to do was spot on.The chef was incredible, the food is amazing and he takes such pride in his work.The rooms were huge, immaculate and it is so fun to stay right in a cave room.We loved this location! We rented an ATV (the brought it right to the hotel and we parked it right there. It was easy and quick to get anywhere on the island.",0
"Walking down the stairs when entering the property you just have to stop and take in the view. Boutique private style with limited rooms,just they way you want it.The breakfast is high end and well worth it. Vassilis,Christina and Calypso all go above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.",0
"We spent a long time reviewing the locations on the island, the accommodation and what there was to see / do. We decided on the Remezzo Villa's and it seemed to match what we were looking for and it exceeded our expectations. Vassilis, Christina & the team of Remezzo were fantastic and looked after us so well. Vassillis understood what we wanted from our 4 night trip and we took all of his recommendations meaning we had the best possible time. Imerovigli was a great location for getting round the island (by transport - 5/10 mins to Fira, 20 mins to Oia, 20 minutes to Sea Side at Perissa Bay). There are about 13 restaurants all with a short walking distance. Food was amazing, we tried a couple locally and one night in Fira (a 20 minute walk if you fancy it or you can get a bus/taxi) Buses are every 20 minutes and taxi's are harder to get as there are only 40 odd on the island but reception will help you.We stayed in the Superior Suite as at the time of the booking, it was the only one available - we were so glad we did, it was fantastic. Such an amazing view of the Sea, Caldera and sunset (Uninterrupted). I have never seen view like it, it was really special. Suite was beautifully decorated and built into the hillside (and had a cave like roof). Very spacious and spotless - our room was cleaned twice! Comfy bed and living area (fridge/cooker etc if we wanted them). The shower was massive!!! The balcony has a lovely large bench (we would sit with cold beer/wine early evening watching the sunset - perfect) and two sun loungers (with clean towels everyday). The pool is just the otherside of the wall, so you can go back and forth if you would like privacy during the day. Pool - was smallish but everything you needed and had seats/beds around. In a lovely setting and we used it every day.Bar/Restaurant - we had breakfast every day (which was a real experience, a relaxing and yummy way to start the day). Cakes/breads/coffee/orange juice, served to you al la carte and a different menu each day (with two hot courses/a dessert). We ate once for lunch and this was delicious. We had several cold Mythos in the bar, it is a great setting, before going out for dinner.Highly recommend the Remezzo, you will not be disappointing.",0
"Searching for a hotel in Santorini is no small task with so many to choose from and typically very high prices (especially during peak season). In our last minute search, i quickly decided I wanted a nice property but wouldnt be able to go full out luxury. Remezzo was a perfect sweet spot as a very nice hotel, in a great location off the town center in Imerovigli though it does not have some of the true luxury touches. Room - we booked 2 different room types (based on availability at booking) but the hotel was great in combining our reservation into the better of the 2 rooms so we did not have to change mid stay. we had a large ""cave"" style suite with a semi-private patio area that was right on the main walking path (from fira to oia). the room was very large and while i was initially worried about the noise (staircase right beside our room and walking path in front) the bedroom location was actually very quiet and private. the bathroom on the other hand does not have a door so privacy there is almost impossible, though it is very large and really embraces the cave style in a modern way. our patio had an amazing view of the sunset so we watched it from our outdoor couch every night. the only thing is that i would have preferred more privacy. with the walking path right there, people often stopped right in front of us to take pictures or even asked us to take their picture. it was also a bit awkward when i wanted to sun on the outdoor couch or loungers and felt i was stared at when people walked by. still the sunset view was amazing (even better than oia!!). the pool at this hotel is one of the things lacking to make it true luxury. it is tiny, has no view of the caldera, and is also right by the walking path. we never actually did more than dip our toes in it but would have spent much more time if it was large and with a better view. food: we only ate breakfast at the hotel one morning, but i wish we had more. it was really nicely prepared with gourmet touches and friendly, casual service. also the tables had a great view and umbrellas to provide shade. note, we did not pick or review a menu, rather received whatever the kitchen was preparing that day. staff: super friendly and very knowledgeable about entire island food, excursions, etc. happy to help you book or simply to provide one off recommendations for things to do. also very helpful in securing hard to get dinner reservations (one or more days in advance ideally). overall would definitely recommend and make sure to take advantage of the staff's recommendations!",0
"I want to thank Vassili and Christina for an amazing stay! Antoni was great as our server for breakfast! A beautifully situated hotel in a quiet and peaceful stretch of Imerivigli. Clean, comfortable and nicly appointed rooms. We stayed in a 2 room villa with 2 teen children. We were super comfy. A fridge was also in the room along with silver wear, plates, cups, etc. This was wonderful because we ate lunch and dinner on many occasions on our patio. The pool was also relaxing! The breakfast... Amazingly delicious! A different 3 course breakfast each day! Vassili and Christina made reservations for us at the beach and reserved losing chairs and umbrellas, and they also provided beach towels daily for us. In addition, they also helped us secure a rental car, where the rental rep came directly to the hotel. There high quality measures of service were greatly appreciated.",0
"This is one of my favorite places on earth. I have stayed in the pool suite twice, once with my children and once on my own and really, this is a very enjoyable place if you want a relaxing hide-way. Vassilis and his team make you feel utterly welcome and will do anything to make you feel at home. Breakfast is a feast on itself, menu style served and an excellent beginning of the day, overlooking the caldera in this magnificent Santorinian setting. A hidden gem on the island!",0
"Seriously, the staff at Remezzo are incredible. Nothing is too much for them, and they are so friendly!The pool is large for the area, and the rooms are nice. Breakfast is really really good. Greek style. The view is extremely panoramic, one of the best spots on the island in my opinion. The town of Imerovigli is nice and quiet and calming compared to the busier towns of Oia and Fira. I highly recommend this place for a relaxing stay in Santorini.",0
"If you want a nice, clean hotel with an amazing view, this is your spot. It’s beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful. As others have mentioned, the staff are incredible. We felt invited, taken care of, and important. In comparison to European standards, these rooms are HUGE! However, the beds are pretty uncomfortable. There is a window unit for air conditioning with a remote digital thermostat. Everything is run by inserting your room key in a card reader. Therefore, when you leave, you lose your air conditioning will turn off leaving you to return to a stuffy room. You’ll find a safe, hair dryer, tv and refrigerator with just a few toiletries. The rooms are clean and well decorated.",0
"The night before we were to arrive in Santorini, I received a welcome email from Kristina and an offer to have us met at the airport if we hadn't already made our transportation plans. As my daughter and I were taking each day as it came, we actually had not thought about transfers and welcomed the idea of a seamless met and drive to the hotel.Upon arrival, we were greeted by Visilis and I knew immediately this was going to be a very special visit. His father started the business over 30 years go and truly ran it like a guest house... and it is run the same way today. He listened closely to what our thoughts were about our itinerary and then proceeded to help us put together an itinerary that was so spot on it was as if he knew us for years. The room was unbelievably clean and serviced twice daily. The breakfasts in the morning were a small feast. The pool was refreshing and the staff was undeniably attentive. The location could not be more perfect. situated between the cruise ship town of Fira and the hampton-like atmosphere of Oia. The view was breathtaking.. Truly extraordinary!   Room Tip: We were on the first floor, steps from the walking path. The breeze the came thru the room was amazi... See more room tips",0
The pool suite has to be the most amazing spot on this entire island and in the world for that matter. Best view of the sunset. Weather is phenomenal so you are ensured an incredible sunset every night.   Room Tip: Pool suite is private and most romantic spot. Breakfast is unforgettable. People are amazing.

"Santorini accommodation is mouth-wateringly expensive for what it is - especially if you want a great caldera view (which you do - it's what the whole island is about). Remezzo Villas is a great way to have a definitive Santorini experience and feel like you're staying in the perfect spot without the scalding price tag of most of the caldera view properties. Imerovigli is an ideal choice of town to stay in - you're at the highest point of any village around the caldera and the views are breathtaking. It's also slightly out of the way of the heavily-trafficked tourist spots of Oia and Fira, so it feels a bit more elegant and upmarket in its relative isolation. The town is full of lovely restaurants so you won't need to venture further if you don't want to at night - we didn't and had two lovely meals at Mezzo and Athenian House. Remezzo is right at the end of the village so you're slightly more secluded and with fewer passers-by. The hotel has all the architectural features to make you feel like you're doing Santorini right. It feels upmarket and it's all in great nick. We had a simple no-view but spacious room, and it is pretty basic, but it worked for us - we spent almost no time there. There were far more lavish rooms available as well which looked great, but worth the money? Not sure unless you really want to hang out there. The service is just outstanding. So friendly and charming and well judged. Couldn't be more helpful in arranging restaurants (and reading our taste perfectly), recommending island activities, arranging 1-day hire car dropped off at the hotel. To top it off we left a pair of trainers in the room on our last day and they were just outstanding in sending them to our next hotel when we got there with no hassle or issue at all. The breakfast on the terrace is great - lots of food and great quality, with a view you will never forget. And cocktails on the same terrace at sunset also just wonderful. The pool is small but it's all you need, and there's plenty of lounging space so you don't feel too on top of each other. Couldn't recommend this place more if we tried. There is no reason to spend anything more or stay anywhere else on Santorini.   Room Tip: Non View Rooms are good value and all you need really. See more room tips",0
We have been here twice now: it's really just a fantastic place to stay. We booked the honeymoon suite on our second trip which is wonderful!! Our own terrace and our own hot tub. Each of the rooms are amazing though and the pool is lovely. It's such a relaxing place with nothing to do with the touristic chaos of Fira. Breakfast is a wonderful 3 course feast and they cater perfectly to any dietary requirements. vasili is also great - offers excellent recommendations on where to go. Will be back again next year if not sooner. Love it!,0
"Tip: If your onward travel is late in the day ask if you can stay longer than the normal checkout time. We did and were able to stay until 4.00 p.m. without any extra charge.Imerovigli is 30 minutes walk from Thira and 2 hours walk from Oia on the coastal path and is beautifully located on the edge of the caldera with great views of the sunset. Remezzo villas are on the Oia side of the village, which is in less densely built than the centre and therefore less overlooked. The villas are quiet and a little set back from the coastal path. They are kept beautifully clean with housekeeping coming in twice a day. Breakfast is well worth having and changes every day. Be warned though - it is a sizeable meal as it has several courses. The small bar means you can have a drink and look over the caldera at sunset (and avoid the crowds at the viewpoints) or later when it is cooler. Vasilis and Christina were very welcoming. It was our wedding anniversary and we came back to a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine in our room. It was totally unexpected and really nice. Good wine too. They will also organise trips for you. We went on a private wine trip they organised and would thoroughly recommend it. Staff were really courteous and helpful.   Room Tip: Rooms 4 and 5 are set back behind the pool and are further form the coastal path See more room tips",1
Our stay was fantastic here at the Remezzo villas. We definitely recommend this accommodation to all those visiting Santorini... Breakfast was lovely and staff was very friendly and helpful also. Well done!   Room Tip: All rooms seem to be lovely! See more room tips,0
"Santorini is an expensive place, especially in Oia. Imerovigli has a quieter pace and this is just the place to stay. Amazing views. And you must try the breakfasts! The staff were very helpful with our lost luggage from our flight in too. We definitely want to return to this stunning accommodation. Although the whole area is expensive, we actually found the rates here relatively reasonable for the value. This is the real Santorini experience! Also don't forget to hike from here to Oia. It's gorgeous!",0
"Everything here is designed for the customer ; staff is very friendly and helpful, outside furniture is in perfect shape, pool is just on the cooler side so it's refreshing, they're changing your towels as soon as you're heading off for dinner, etc...The price is accordingly high, of course, but for our last night in santorini we had decided to treat ourselves and we don't regret it one bit !View is awesome, from the rooms as from the (numerous) roof top terraces. We just loved it !",0
"Remezzo was wonderful! We loved everything about it especially the amazing view and beautiful room. In a perfect location, away from busy Fira and Oia but still easy to get to both. Close to lovely restaurants. The breakfast was a stand out! The staff, especially Christina, Vasilis and Antony, were just lovely. They helped us plan our days there and made sure we saw all the interesting places and ate at all the good local restaurants. I'd definitely go back to Remezzo!",0
We stayed three nights at Remezzo Villas and it was a beautiful holiday. The staff were so friendly and helped us plan our stay. The views were awesome. The only thing better than the scenery was the breakfasts!!!!!!! Definitely coming back.,0
"My wife and I stayed at Remezzo Villas mid/late June for 4 nights and had an unbelievable trip to Santorini! Vassilis, Christina & the team of Remezzo really took care of us while we were there and their attention to customers as well as enjoying Santorini is obvious. The room was cleaned daily (2 times I believe- morning and evening), they were large rooms with great views of the Caldera and Oia. The breakfast served each morning is a 3-4 course fixed menu and was fabulous. Anthony the server and bartender was very friendly and made waking up to breakfast with a view that much more pleasurable. The location is superb as you are in the middle between Oia and Thera as well as close to a store, ATM, a few restaurants/cafe, bus stop and ATV rentals. Also in my opinion the sunsets from Imerovigli looking towards Oia are far better as you get to look directly at the sunset from Remezzo. If you go to Santorini give Remezzo Villas a serious look!",0
"My husband and I stayed at Remezzo Villas for 10 nights for our honeymoon. This place just exceeded our expectations! We were able to explore the high attraction areas to the less touristy local areas and, in our opinion, the views from our villa were the most stunning! It was perfect to be able to adventure during the day and then come back to our quiet and private villa to relax and enjoy the sunset views. You cannot beat the location. It's located in Immerovigli, so you can take a short scenic hike to Fira or a more intense hike to Oia. Both of which are beautiful!!Breakfast was served outside with the sea view every morning and it tasted phenomenal! It was the best way to start each day!Also, I cant say enough about the wonderful staff. Each and every staff member were very helpful and friendly (shout out to Vassilis and Christina!). We looked forward to visiting with everyone each day. They went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. And they were! :",0
Remezzo was such a delight. Everything was perfect and we felt truly honoured. Every staff member was warm and gentle. The advise we were given about what to do in Santorini was ideal for the time we had and really showed off the island to its best with a balance of stillness and activity. We could not have been happier and will measure a future of hotel stays against this for the rest of our lives. We stayed at another venue our first night in Santorini for almost twice the price and didn't experience a fraction of the service at Remezzo. I'd fly 26hours from Australia again just to do it all over again.,0
"We had a great time on the beautiful island of Santorini and we LOVED this hotel! The views are incredible, the room immaculate and the staff super friendly and very helpful (a big thanks in particular to Vassilis and Christina). They made restaurant reservations for us, gave us very good recommendations on activities and arranged transfers and car rental. The breakfasts are really good too. The location in Imerovigli is perfect; you can walk to several restaurants (Aegeon was our favorite) and mini markets. Highly recommended!",0
"Just returned from a fairy tale trip to Santorini, that included mine and my husband's wedding at Remezzo. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and its owner, Vassilis. From the minute we arrived, he made our group feel welcome and right at home. The rooms were all gorgeous and the view is just breathtaking. I've been to Santorini before and the view from Remezzo is the best on the island. The entire staff at this hotel works SO hard to ensure all the guests have the best vacation of their lives...and we sure did!   Room Tip: The pool suite was INCREDIBLE and worth the upgrade! See more room tips",1
"The hotel is located In Imerovigli which is between the larger towns of Fira and Oia. It has a fabulous view of the Caldera and is right on the footpath, a short walk from many restaurants. We also avoided the crowds at the the larger towns.Our room was small (as expected) but clean with a comfortable bed and a coffee maker and hotplate (though we never cooked). The breakfast was very good and the staff were really friendly and helpful. They arranged to pick us up from the Ferry and dropped us to the airport ( 22 Euros each way) which was very convenient.",0
"We finished our 2 weeks of island hopping at Santorini and stayed for 3 nights at Remezzo. We (2 adults, 2 teen daughters) really enjoyed the place; it has spectacular views from the caldera and the sunsets are amazing. Service is of high standards, Vassilis, Konstantina and their staff know how to efficiently run a hotel, their service is excellent and Vassilis knows the island, and was very eager to advice us on restaurants and sights to visit. We rented a car through him, which is recommended when you want to explore Santorini.The accommodation is clean, functional and stylishly decorated, all rooms have sea view. Breakfast was just amazing with everyday a different 3-course meal deliciously prepared by the chef. We would highly recommend Remezzo and would certainly return here on our next trip to Santorini.",1
"What a great place to stay. The breakfast is to die for. You can watch the sunset from your room. We asked for recommendations of where to eat and they gave us local place where the food was great, and prices where cheap. Recommend staying here with your family. We will come again.",0
"We celebrated my partner’s birthday with a long weekend getaway at the Remezzo. We could not have asked for a better romantic experience than what Vassilis and his team provided for the both of us. The location is nothing shy of amazing and we would recommend Imerovigli to anyone wanting a spectacular view of the caldera and a peaceful atmosphere. The suite was very nicely appointed, and the private heated pool over looking the cliff was heavenly for a morning or late evening dip. The food was top notch as we spent our mornings with Antony serving us a fantastic 3-course breakfast. The head chef prepared creative dishes that suited my partners gluten sensitivities to include a marvelous gluten free cake that was out of this world…thank you, John! We also were surprised with a fresh plate of fruits and champagne to celebrate prior to going out to a birthday dinner at one of Vassilis’ recommended restaurants, The Athenian House (Outstanding). Vassilis knows this island and laid out all the places we needed and in which order to maximize our short visit, he absolutely hit a home run with each of them (Scenic/historic sites, bakeries, wineries, restaurants). Even though parking will become more of a challenge heading into high season, we would still recommend a car. Vassilis, Christina, Antony, John and the kind gentleman who took our bags both down and up the stairs…thank you so much and we cannot recommend your little piece of Santorini enough!Warm Regards,Richard and Sandr",1
"loved everything about the hotel - the room, the pool, the view, Vassalis and Constantina who ran the place and offered lots of great advice about sightseeing and things to do, and especially the sumptuous breakfasts, different everyday, by a wonderful chef   Room Tip: we had a suite which was wonderful See more room tips",0
The view was stunning. The host were very helpful giving tips on where to go and what to see on the island. Our room was was just steps away from the foot path to oiha. It is a beautiful and unique hotel with amazing views of the sunset.,0
"Let me first say that this is not a hotel, it is a home away from home. From the moment you arrive you are greeted with by the most genuinely friendly people I have ever had the pleasure to meet on my travels so far. We were briefed on amenities, the room as well as some of the activities on offer around the island. We became familiar with 2 of the owners, Vassilis and Christina who are so helpful and friendly and have gone above and beyond the cll of duty to make our stay absolutely amazing.If in our budget, I highly suggest you book the pool suite which features a large heated jacuzzi style private pool, with a wide open view of the sunset and Oia, a town worth a visit. The cave like room has everything from a TV, wrap around couch, mini bar fridge, and a rain shower overlooking the sunset to name a few. This is also the best room they have I believe.Breakfast is different each day, but consists of a 3 course meal in fine dining style on the upper level of the 'hotel' where the reception/bar is located. Coffee, tea and juice are all part of the menu and I assure you your tastebuds will be taken on a culinary journey.The level of attention to detail and cleanliness is amazing for such a small operation and you will definitely notice each detail that goes into making your stay memorable.Side note: WiFi included. The hotel also has a shared pool. The hotel can also arrange a rental car which is a good idea to explore the island and is highly suggested.   Room Tip: Pool suite room is a must See more room tips",1
The villa we had was fantastic. Unique design is cave like with skylight tunnels. The views are amazing--you're right on the cliff. The pedestrian walkway between Fira and Oia is right there. Our stay included a three course breakfast plus a bakery basket and fresh orange juice and coffee. One day we had a potato soup shot and another we had a fruit smoothie shot. They also did our laundry for us and arranged a private wine tasting tour. We will be back.,1
"We stayed at the Remezzo Villas May 15 and 16, and it couldn't have been better. The staff were all friendly and very helpful with getting reservations, helping with luggage, and calling taxis. We enjoyed the idyllic setting, the scenery, the sunsets, and the outstanding breakfasts. Loved it.   Room Tip: I don't think there is a bad view in the building. See more room tips",1
"As you come down the stairs you are greeted with a wondrous view of the caldera. You think, ""I could stay here forever"". In my opinion, what made remezzo perfect was the hospitality and great care they give you. Upon checkin vassilis took time to ask what we wanted to do and proceeded to give us his insider tips and recommendations. Christina showed us our gorgeous and spacious suite, and I mentioned i had forgotten my shoes in another island. By the next night my shoes were in my room!!! They made restaurant and activity recommendations and reservations. We had a wonderful lovely time. To top it all off, on our last night they had a fruit plate and champagne waiting for us in our room thanking us for choosing to spend our 10 yr anniversary there!!! Just wow, they went above and beyond every single day of our stay. I cannot recommend this place enough. We have traveled plenty and remezzo by far is on our favorites list, not only for the stunning views, but for the whole experience. Really, pictures cannot do it justice and trust me, you will be treated to a 5 star experience. Thanks to the remezzo family for making our stay memorable. We will surely be back!",1
"stop me cos i might not be able to stop admiring this beautiful hotel... brilliant location, lovely views ( even the best sunset views ), great food (whenever we ate here) ... the breakfast was gourmet treat every morning... the best recommendations, would make our reservations, arrange our trips on the island... never disappointed .... very very very helpful staff (vassillis, christina & antonio ) ... thanks Vassillis for everything you did for us ... it felt like we were home and not a hotel ! ... yammas my friend ! we left with a great appreciation for Greece and Greek people !",1
"Upon our arrival Christina greeted us with a beautiful smile and a nice chilled glass of local white wine. As a result of being on holiday it seems we lost track of the days and arrived a day early. Christina made sure we were taken care of we were able to check in that day. Our room was beautifully appointed and our view was spectacular. We had great service and it was nice to be greeted each morning with a smile and Kali Mera from all the staff. I would suggest the walk to Thira along the path, it is both beautiful and relaxing. The kitchenette was also a plus, we bought some fruit, cheese, olives and wine and were able to relax on our little patio and watch the sunset. It was windy most days but we still were able to enjoy. Vasili was more than accommodating and made us feel welcomed. We rented a car for the 4 days we were there and highly recommend. This gives you freedom to enjoy the other parts of the island. The Wine museum was most interesting and also Kamari which is a quaint beach town with many restaurants to enjoy. Thank you Christina and Vasili......you made our stay memorable and beautiful",0
"Located in imorvegli a quiet place 8-10 minutes away from fira by atv or taxi, overlooking the aegean sea and caldera with stunnig views from our pool suite which was really private, we had a blast.The staff were very helpful and great. Beautiful christina took us to our suite and Vasillis (if am not mistaken, that was his name) was very helpful gave us a map overview of santorini with tips and recommendations for restaurants and places to visit!The pool suite was very clean comfortable and spacious. The pool and shower water was a bit salty which was weird. The breakfast was a 5 meal course nice and tasty but we prefer a buffet so we can choose what we want un terms of type and quantity and serve our selves quickly rather than wait for the plates to arrive (this is our personal preferance), so we skipped breakfast the next morning and had our own in our balacony which was just great! All in all it was such a remarkable place, great people and excellent location and very hard to leave :( will be back a again when visiting santorini!",0
"We spent one week in a superior suite with our 8-month baby and we did leave the hotel with a bit of nostalgia! The room and all facilities are perfectly clean and very nicely decorated. Vassilis and his team are extremely friendly and very attentive to and helpful with all guests' needs. Having breakfast with the stunning view from the terrace was an everyday surprise as the chef (well trained in France for 9 years) is cooking something different everyday with local products. Another pro is the location of the hotel, very near the Main Street which thus means less steps in comparison with other hotels after a tiring day of exploring the island. I could only highly recommend this hotel, whether for a romantic or family trip. All the best to you guys and keep doing your fantastic work!",1
"Santorini is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful places on earth. Remezzo Villas is the place to stay to fully enjoy it. Perfect caldera views, and the cooked breakfast is AMAZING in quality and quantity, different every day. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and go out of their way to ensure that your stay is comfortable. The location is perfect for romance, quiet, and the sea view room we were in had an unobstructed view of the caldera all the way to Oia. It is a short walk to several very good restaurants. You will surely enjoy a lifetime treat by staying here.",1
"We booked Remezzo after our good friends recommended.The Remezzo hotel turned out to be even better than we expected...Amazing view, clean and beautiful room, marvelous breakfast...But the most amazing part was the staff and the service level.Never seen anything like it.Warm, kind, helpful people that we already miss!Thank you guys, we sill surely come and visit!",1
"Knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and accommodating staff. Lovely accommodations with stunning views. Breakfast is fantastic too! Almost equal distance from Oia and Fera so conveniently located to the best locations for dinner, shopping, touring, or nightlife.",1
"I love traveling and have been to Many places but never have I met such helpful staff as at this hotel! The owner Vasillis is usually around and knows the nicest places and best restaurants around, he helps you have a vacation catered to your needs. They are always asking how you are and if everything is how you would like it to be. We were very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast served, it was a four course breakfast and different every day. The location was perfect, it was in a part of Imerovigli which was easy to reach by car and because it's just outside the center of town it is nice and quiet( maybe that was because we were there off season), incomparable views from this hotel especially our honeymoon suite. It is nice and private contrary to many hotels with balconies which can be overlooked or are simply right next to a tourist trail. The Jacuzzi was the perfect temperature even though it was a bit chilly and windy outside. I really recommend Remezzo villas!",0
"From the airport we start our amazing vacation with a kind and good looking guy and incredible car waiting us .. Outside of Remezzo it was a groom and he took our suitcases to the hotel.. When I went down the stairs and turn on the space I found the reception and the fairytale begin! Vasilis it was professional and friendly and he gave us all the important informations for the island. Also the suite has a so modern decor and we stayed speechless. After we slept we wake up and we went for breakfast ,first time in our life we ate such a delicious and rich breakfast it was amazing!!! The other days been so beautiful the view of the hotel it was incredibly with Amazing sunset! And for sure we will came back!!",0
"Wonderful views, amazing staff, delicious breakfasts .. Excellent!Great location from what you can travel all over the island. As for me - the best way is to rent the car. There is a parking nearby the villa.It is the best place where I've been ever!   Room Tip: Room #8 has unbelievable see view. See more room tips",0
"This place is one of the best values I've ever experienced. When we arrived, we had a little difficulty finding it, because it is literally located in an old winery on the edge of a cliff in Santorini! The view of the caldera and surrounding area is absolutely to die for! I could just sit there all day and be mesmerized by it! The hotel staff is superb, starting with the owner/manager Vasillis. First of all, we arrived very early, and he allowed us to check in well before the standard check in time. He was on point with all his suggestions for activities on the island, including winery tours, places to eat, and a very special Good Friday ceremony where the ancient city of Pyrgos lights of with candles and torches.One word of warning -- there are a large number of steps to get down to the villas and no elevator, so it is not for the faint of heart.Overall, this place is a jewel. I would go back in a heartbeat!",0
"The staff were very helpful, Vasiley, Christina and the rest of the staff could not do enough for you. We stayed in suite # 5, a lovely suite with the pool just outside. Our friends were in the pool suite and it was the nicest private pool suite that we observed while walking along the caldera. The honeymoon suite was also very nice. Imerovigli is very peaceful with a spectular view and not as busy as Oia. Yanni the chef prepared delicious breakfasts and went out of his way to accomodate our vegan friend. You are only a 5-10 minute walk away from many restaurants. Be prepared for lots of stairs to climb. I would highly recommend Remezzo for service, view and food.   Room Tip: I would rate pool room, honeymoon suite, superior studio or studio 5 as the best rooms in the place. See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in Oct 2015. We chose to stay here because it was the only villa we could that had a heated pool. We stayed in the pool suite, and we were not disappointed. The room was very lovely and the pool was amazing. The views were also breathtaking. A very tranquil and relaxing place. The staff were also very friendly and very welcoming. Really lovely people and down to earth.This villa is more towards the quiet side of the Imerovigli town - so there is not much human traffic but you may find it a bit of walk to the restaurants and bus stations.   Room Tip: Pool suite is amazing See more room tips",0
"For my honeymoon, I was on a mission to find a hotel with a private pool suite that was truly private. Through my extensive research, I discovered that many ""private pools"" in Santorini are in full view of people walking down the street or people above you on the caldera. Remezzo had the only secluded private pool suite I could find that overlooked the caldera, and it did not disappoint! Breathtaking is the best word to describe the view from this room/pool. The deck is at the edge of the caldera with no older buildings below, which made us feel like we were on top of the world. The pictures don't do it justice!Not only were we blown away by the suite, we absolutely loved the hospitality. Vassilis, Christina, and Ralph did an incredible job making us feel like we were somehow at a luxury resort and a cozy B&B at the same time. I would highly recommend Remezzo for anyone looking for breathtaking views and wonderful service in Santorini.   Room Tip: Pool suite is the best! One of the few truly secluded private pools in Santorini. See more room tips",1
"The staff is friendly, location is fabulous & short hike from Oia. The hotel offers nice breakfast in the morning and they also have couple of gorgeous pools to bathe in with the caldera views as backdrop. Highly recommend staying here!",1
"Here is your place to stay in Santorini. Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The view is stunning. The rooms authentic and clean. The breakfast......amazing. The host, Vassilles is charming and so helpful.",1
"The hotel located at the highest point of Santorini - Imerovigli. Nice location overlooking the view of caldera, even you can see Oia from far. My husband and I were staying at honeymoon suite, a very big cave-type room. The appearance outside of the room is quite old. Both of us didn't really like the room. Cleanliness of the room is average, I don't like the bleaching smells after they clean the room. They only provide one 1.5L bottled mineral water for 3 nights stay, no top-up for everyday. No coffee,sugar or tea bag provided. Breakfast is not buffet type but quite delicious. We like the view, not the hotel, not the room.   Room Tip: If you like cave room, choose honeymoon suite See more room tips",3
"Remezzo Villas are situated on the highest point of the beats island of Santorini, you get amazing views where u can see nearly the whole island! Because we were there at the end of October it was a little chilly in the evenings with a strong breeze but we had clear sunny days! The staff in the Villas were very helpful, they gave us a detailed quick guide of the island and for places to visit and recommend some really nice restaurants! We also got an upgrade to a senior suite which was amazing, over looking the pool and had a huge jacuzzi, the room had everything we needed. If we come back to Santorini will definitely be staying here again!",0
"Perfect, laid back, family friendly. Any place that likes dogs is a good place. Great recommendations for around the island. Breakfast is HUGE. Only downside was our leaking/running toilet - just the clean part. Vistas from heaven and a haven from the crowds.",0
"I can't recommend Remezzo Villas enough, they are stunning.Beautiful rooms with superb views of the caldera. The staff are also amazing. Vassilis and Christina gave my wife and I fantastic recommendations of things to do, places to visit and restaurants to dine at. They made several dinner reservations for us at different restaurants and we always had the best seat in the house. Behind the scenes staff were also lovely and went out of their way to accommodate guests. Breakfast was delicious! It was also always a pleasure to pat Mr. Fix! We hope we are lucky enough to return to Remezzo Villas one day!",0
"We spent three nights at Remezzo Villas at the end of a two week holiday in Greece. What a wonderful way to end our break and the views are spectacular - who needs to go to Oia? From the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome and we were recommended some really good restaurants which lived up to expectations. If ever Remezzo publishes a recipe book of their breakfast food range, I want to be the first person to buy one. The variety and taste of the breakfast selection was by far and away the best we've had in many years of travel. On top of all of this we were pleasantly surprised with the treat to celebrate my husband's birthday. Remezzo will definitely be my pick if we decide to return to Santorini in the future.",0
"We stayed for one week at Remezzo. The service offered at the hotel was excellent. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was really good. We stayed in a suite near the pool but unfortunately for the first few days we were surrounded by members of a wedding party who tended to congregate around the pool area outside our room,resulting in a little less privacy and more noise than we would have liked in such a beautiful setting. Obviously this is not something that can be controlled by the management but just the luck of the draw. The view of the sunset from the pool terrace is I think a superior experience to what you might get in Oia, where the tourist crowd can spoil your enjoyment. Thank you Vassilis, Christina and crew.   Room Tip: We had room 4 which was next to the pool, really lovely, but depending on those around you, could be... See more room tips",0
"Outstanding service. Very friendly and helpful staff. Amazing location. Value for money. Cannot fault anything. The rooms were modern, clean and comfortable. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed on through our entire 3 month trip through Europe. The 4 course free breakfast was really nice. Changes everyday. We would definitely stay here again.",0
"We had a lovely stay at Remezzo Villas, and would be very happy to recommend this lovely hotel! We had 2 rooms: the Deluxe Suite (room nr 3), and a Junior Suite. The Deluxe Suite was an amazing, spacious room - with 3 bedrooms it can sleep up to 6 people. It also has a lovely bathroom with an amazing bath & shower. The Junior Suite had a private balcony overlooking the Caldera, and was extremely spacious. Both rooms had excellent wifi as well.One of the highlights of our stay was the lovely breakfast, a four course meal every morning. Another highlight was the amazing staff, so helpful and friendly. Upon check-in we got lots of fantastic advice about activities, sights and restaurants. The hotel was happy to make restaurant reservations for us every day.Overall, I would highly recommend Remezzo Villas, and I hope I will be back soon.",1
"Where do i start? Me and my wife decided to spend 1 night at remezzo villas as we had booked another (very expensive) hotel for the follow 2 days. After spending 24 hours as remezzo,we were so heartbroken to have to leave this amazing hotel. The staff are amazing.. the veiw breathtaking...and at great prices.This is simple a great place to stay to relax. Lot of shops in walking distance. Remezzo..we miss you. :-)",0
We just stayed here for five nights. I booked based on reviews from Trip Advisor and we are very glad we did. The hotel is beautiful and the location is very central to getting around the island. I prefer to be away from the crowds and this location is much quieter. All the reviews you read are accurate. The customer service is top notch. We arrived and Christina immediately started working with us to create our plan for the week. She also made all the reservations. Trip was amazing,0
"Lovely hotel, although the layout gives it more of an apartment feel than your typical hotel. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the location was great - only a 20 min scenic walk along the hillside to Fira",0
"Remezo is one of many boutique hotels on the volcanic mountainous island of Santorini. Most of these hotels are build into the side of the mountain still using the ancient ""cave"" rooms as part of the hotel. Focal to the hotel is the interaction with a wonderful lady Calypso and her brother Vassilis who are very worldly and very informative. Since the island tourist industry closed up by November, owners like this brother and sister act know quite well the outside world and the role Santorini plays in global travelers. The first aspect of Santorini life to emphasize is STEPS. Yes, steps that probably number in the hundreds of thousands over the island or should I say up and down the island. Most but not all of the steps have handrails. Those that do not have handrails require VERY careful traverse. Remezzo like most hotels in their hilltop city has an entry from the TOP, down a few dozen stairs to a lovely ""lobby"" from where guests fan out to the 20 or so rooms surrounding a small courtyard with a small but very functional and delightful swimming pool. You stay at Remezzo and hotels like it for the view, and Irmovigli allows a view to the north most town of Oia sticking out on one end of the inverted C and down the island to its southern most towns, all elevated up on the mountain plateau. The most dramatic time on Santorini is through sunset including the time when the town like Oia twinkle into the evening and night, producing an almost as lovely mood as sunset. Remezzo has a wonderful food service of its own, breakfast and dinner. Our chef was fantastic and all the staff was highly interactive throughout all our meals. The main town Fira is just a short walk north of Irmovigli but we enjoyed the people and food at Remezzo so much that we only ventured out for meals once and that visit to a restaurant Mezzo was not so rewarding. Santorini requires a car to do much touring, mainly to get to Akrotiri a 7000 year old antiquity city that has only recently been excavated (starting 1987). The guides at that site were most informative. Had it not been for Kalipso our hostess at Remezzo (who gives a encyclopedic intro to the island) we would not have visited Akrotiri. The hotel rooms are small at most of the boutique hotels but are well afforded with TV (ours was hard to work) and lighting but little closet space. Of course there are STEPS up and down to all the rooms including our which was set off by itself. Remezzo is a unique experience.

"This hotel is great, the service is awesome, the views are amazing, but the one thing they don't really tell you about is the breakfast. I must say that we were absolutely blown away with the quality and quantity of the food we received every morning, and that alone would keep us coming back for more. Breakfast each day was a four(!) course meal that would start with a plate of sweet and savory breads, followed by some sort of pie, followed by an egg dish, and finally finished with a dessert of fruit. That's right, I just listed four courses for a breakfast. The service from Christina was also a very underrated part of the property. Every morning she acted as our personal concierge by booking reservations at restaurants, getting us tickets for boats and ferries, calling shuttles, etc. I felt like I could have booked a whole separate vacation just through her. The view of Remezzo is incredible (as the pictures show). Living on the side of a cliff is just as cool as it sounds. All in all, there is a 100% chance we will stay here again when we come back to Santorini.",0
"Santorini is all about view and we got the best view from our room. the room service and breakfast was equally good. we stayed there for 3 nights and everyday got a surprise like a bottle of wine,bouquet of fresh flowers,etc. had a memorable stay.",0
"I booked Remezzo villas based on reviews I had read and was certainly not disappointed. It has the most beautiful outlook and the staff are wonderful. We firstly stayed in the private pool suite which is actually private. There are no overlooking rooms and the actual room and deck are huge for Santorini. The pool is very much your plunge pool (small) but nice to laze in while admiring the view. We then moved to another room which was also large and had a sizeable courtyard lounge area with nearly as great views but not uninterrupted like the pool suite has.The breakfast is exemplary and changed daily. The staff are on hand at all times to offer assistance, book restaurants, clean your room and turn your bed down. Wifi is excellent as rooms appear to have their own modem. If there was any negative it would be the waft of sewerage smell that comes by often given that everyone is on septic tanks that seem to be getting emptied but I don't think this is isolated to this hotel.. Just the way it goes in Santorini.Although Remezzo is not a 5 star hotel its definitly rated 5 for excellent. It offers a wonderful level of service and very well appointed rooms and common areas. Like many hotels in the area it has amazing views of the caldera but it is at a decent price point (for Santorini). It's in a quieter area but still walking distance (not too many steps compared to some we saw) to restaurants and mini mart. Imerovigli is central to everything. We didn't have a car but still saw everything we wanted to either on foot or bus. However most days you may never want to leave and you certainly don't have to to catch an amazing sunset!   Room Tip: Private pool suite amazing See more room tips",4
"Everything was perfect ~ the views were breathtaking, the apartment was beautiful, the pool area was very restful, the staff amazing, the breakfasts were the best we have had anywhere in the world, the wine wonderful and it was a perfect base for fabulous restaurants x   Room Tip: We had an apartment with a pool view ~ perfect x See more room tips",1
"The entrance to this lovely hotel is breathtaking. We four could not believe our eyes. It was that beautiful. The rooms are clean and interesting. It does not appear that any two are alike in this former winery built into the cliff. The breakfast is amazing and served on a terrace overlooking the caldera. Actually, the entire hotel has a caldera view and the sunset can be enjoying from the pool, or any number of terraces. We left a few hours ago and we are already planning our return. The staff was extremely helpful and made the stay special.",1
"My (now) husband and I spent 4 nights at Remezzo Villas during our honeymoon. First of all, don't think twice about staying in Imerovigli. It is by far the quietest and most beautiful part of the island with a caldera view. We visited Fira and Oia by foot and were soo surprised at how busy both areas were compared to our time in Imerovigli. It seemed like there were only ever 5 people around us give or take when we were wondering around the hotel. It was so lovely. We stayed in the Honeymoon double suite with the outdoor jacuzzi. Best decision we've ever made. If you are considering it (even if it means you need to stretch your vacation budget or cut elsewhere), do it! The jacuzzi water was lukewarm which was perfect for watching the sunset and having a glass of wine in the evening (we bought lanterns at a store and set the area up so that it was candlelit). It was also the perfect temperature for lounging after breakfast and before we started our day.Next, breakfast was perfection. We only skipped the Remezzo breakfast one day of our stay and we regretted it instantly. It always involved fresh orange juice, coffee, bread, baked goods, and 2 additional courses. The view while you are eating is spectacular of course. When we first read that it was 16 euros each, we thought it was a bit steep... but by the third time we ate the breakfast there, we were talking about what great value the meal was for ONLY 16 euros. That's how good it was. Vassilis was a perfect host. He was so helpful at every point of our stay. Even before we arrived, we were confused about whether our online ferry tickets were purchased properly. He called the company to check for us and even picked up our tickets before we arrived. It was such a relief. He had incredible suggestions for how to spend our days and was nothing but completely kind, respectful and helpful.They sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne with fruit on our last night to celebrate our honeymoon and it was such a nice surprise. I am beyond happy with our decision to stay at Remezzo. Best location, breakfast and room (with the jacuzzi) on the island when you consider value of what you get for how much you spend. We WILL be back!",4
"If you get to spend few days at Remezzo Villas, you will understand why it is so successful as it is. Best sunset view of Santorini. Away from the crowded Fira. Great breakfast for all-day energy. Great advice and information from Remezzo staff: exclusive restaurants, places worth visiting,... We had a really nice stay in the Master Suite and will return for sure here!!! Thank you Remezzo Villas staff",0
"I stayed here beginning of August for 2 weeks with my 14 year old daughter and friend, we were amazed at the view every morning and evening. The most beautiful place i have ever stayed. The rooms were great and cleaned constantly - were left immaculate. Calypso and Vasillies are amazing hosts and as everyone has said before could not do enough. The location is perfect and the weather is fabulous, very hot through the day but a lovely cool breeze in the evening. It was our first time in Santorini and it was heaven, lots to see and the food amazing even for me who is a vegetarian. We had a wonderful holiday and was so sad to leave. This is definitely the best place to stay, perfect location, perfect accommodation and perfect hosts. You will not find better!   Room Tip: Every room is just perfect here - the view will blow you away See more room tips",0
"We randomly booked remezzo villas for 2 nights before joining a 5 star hotel in oia and were extremely impressed by (1) the hotel location (2) the excellent service and kindness of our hosts (3) the amazing food - worth mentioning, the breakfast which is absolutely incredible (4) vassily's (the owner) network in the island which enabled us to be very well greeted in a couple of overbooked restaurants - we hardly waited for our tables and the food again was excellent. Overall remezzo is very good value for money and the hotel has a very relaxed and friendly vibe which makes one feel immediately comfortable.",1
"Had a fantastic time, very friendly interactive owners and extremely clean and tidy. would highly recommend the hotel and the resort as near enough to everything, but also far enough away rom the hustle and bustle of Fira and Ios.Steep cliffs, so lot's of stairs and narrow pathways, so not recommended for people with disabilities or families with very young children, ie prams, excellent resort for couples of all ages",0
"This this place exceded our expectation in every way. The staff was warm and attentive, you can tell they take pride in their service. The breakfast was excellent. And the views were breathtaking. We had a perfect stay! What a gem!",0
"My review comes a bit late, but i guess later is better then never.  I stayed at Remezzo in the first week from September 2014. I did a lot of research for that holiday and i booked several hotels. With many hotels there were talks about to many stairs, good or not so good views of the caldera, good or not so good breakfast, good or not so good staff.  Let me tell you that Remezzo has got it all. No stairs( or just a fiew compared to others in Imerovigli), excellent breakfast, an amazing view off the sunset( the same as Oia) and Vasilli is the best. We never went rong when we followed his advices regarding restaurants and things to do. He actually spends 20-30 min with every tourist after they check in and gives a lot of info and advices. Helps with car rental, carries suitcases, etc.  We had a small apartment right by the pool a lot of things are are made of stone(rocks) the bed is actually a very comfy met on a big stone. The room is very clean, it's cleaned twice a day. The bathroom is huge and unique. We also had a small kitchen.  I have nothing to complain about this hotel.  I think it was the best hotel we ever stayed in.  Imerovigli is simply beautiful and relaxing with great places to eat and a nice 20-25 minutes walk to Fira which we enjoyed every time.  If we ever visit Santorini again Remezzo is the place for me.",0
"We stayed at the Remezzo for two nights during our trip to Greece. It was a beautiful property in the wonderful village of Imerovigli. If you are trying to decide what area to stay in on Santorini, choose Imerovigli! Fira and Oia are great to visit, but if you want to truly relax, Imerovigli is the place to be (and it is central and easy to get to).The Remezzo staff were thoughtful, accommodating and extremely helpful. The included breakfast was the best we ate during our trip to Greece and the dinner prepared by their chef was amazing. Also the view was fantastic. People will try to tell you that Oia has the best sunset view but we absolutely think the Imerovigli sunset was even better (and we did both).We booked a Junior suite and it was clean, large and comfortable (traditional santorini room- mostly white and blues). We had a secluded patio with lounge chairs where we were able to relax and take in the views.What set the Remezzo apart was the staff. From the moment we arrived they made sure we had everything we needed (we had some special requests and they were able to accommodate every single one). They helped us plan our time in Santorini (sat with us at breakfast to go over a map of the island) and gave us amazing restaurant recommendations. The staff truly helped us have an amazing time in Santorini.",0
"Just returned from a two week stay at this fabulous hotel. The staff are truly outstanding, the bar snacks delicious and the sunbeds are quite simply the most comfortable I ever been on. Breakfast was fabulous with delicious Greek yogurt, warm croissants, eggs both hot and hard boiled, a selection of cold meats, hot foods such as bacon, sausages etc and then fruit, cereals, biscuits, cakes, and local Greek delicacies. Thank you to all the staff for making this the one hotel in all our years of travel that we hope to return to.",5
"Hotel 28. What a fantastic place to stay. We stayed for 2 weeks in August 2016 and were greeted like old friends when we arrived even though it was our first visit. Our room was spacious and kept spotlessly clean every day by our maid whose name we are ashamed to say we don't know. She took great care in ensuring our room was perfect. The bar food was great and plentiful prepared by Sasha the chef, and served to is by the lovely Vaso who was great fun all day everyday looking after the pool bar. The breakfasts were amazing with hot and cold food, breads and croissants, and fruits with Mimoza on hand to prepare fried eggs on demand. Pretty Elina and Stelios looked after us from late afternoon into the night. Stelios? Well he provided good (and sometimes bad!) conversation from the philosophy of the Greek language and West Ham FC! And he was always entertaining well into the night whilst serving drinks until all guests went to bed safe in the knowledge that Yanis was looking after us all through the night. That leaves Agi - the font of all knowledge that is Santorini. She advised us where to go, what to eat and reserved us the best tables in the restaurants we chose to eat in. Her laugh is like no other and kept us smiling throughout the day. To use Agi's words our holiday was ""fantastic, fantastic"" and ""perfect"". We will definitely be returning in the near future. Thanks to all the staff who we cannot praise enough.",3
"Both my husband and I had a brilliant two week stay at Hotel 28. Aggie was great fun, very friendly and knowledgeable - always there to give advice and help. Thanks so much for making breakfast time fun and bringing smiles to our faces. Vasso and Stelios at the bar were also great and friendly. I'm still trying to work out who was the bad influence at the late night bar.... stelios or my husband!! Breakfast was lovely. A good variety of scrubble (scrambled) eggs, omelettes, bacon, sausage, cakes and pastries, cookies, fruits, breads, homemade jams, Greek yoghurt, fruit juices, teas, coffees and hot chocolate. Rooms.... Perfect. Had what was needed and excellent comfy beds.I could go on, but everyone and everything was great, and a short walk to the restaurants and bars.In closing.... Aggie. I am sat here eating my fig jam. Lovely and thankyou. XxxxxX   Room Tip: All good rooms. Ours was ground floor overlooking pool so we were a skip away from the sunbeds and... See more room tips",3
"First time but definitely not the last !! Fabulous hotel, great location and amazing staff !! Nothing was too much trouble, from booking top restaurants at amazing locations (never had a bad meal) to organising our quad bike rental, everything was done with a smile and that laugh !!!! Fabulous pool bar and best cocktails just made it even better. Óáò åõ÷áñéóôþ üëïõò áðü ôï íÝï óáò ößëïõò ÌÜñêï êáé Ëïõßæ",2
"Our stay at Hotel 28 was perfect. The room was spacious and clean with a good bed. And the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location, relatively close to the beach and shops. The best hotel for a stay in Santorini!",2
"Just got home from an amazing week at Hotel 28. The hotel is perfectly located for exploring the whole island and is a short walk to kamari beach, set back from the busy strip it is so peaceful. The hotel is simply perfect, we loved our room and the pool. The hotel food is incredible and very reasonably priced. But of course this hotel would be nothing without the amazing staff who made us feel so welcome. I cannot thank you all enough for making santorini so special for us. Aggy's help and recommendations for exploring the island were always incredible especially the food! Elina and yanis thank you for making us laugh and welcoming us with open arms. And the lovely Vaso who makes the best ice cream frappe on the island!!!! It is so sad to be home but I can't wait to come back and stay again, thank you for making our holiday the best one yet!",3
"Staff were fantastic, bar and food were well priced. Chips were some of the best I have tasted. Very clean facilities and was all around extremely pleasant.Only a 5-10 minute walk to the beach, but could have easily remained by the pool all day. Not a bad thing to say.",3
"We stayed in Hotel 28 at the end of July. We had traveled to Santorini for a family wedding and stayed for a week. What an amazing place. From the time you check in you feel at home straight away. The staff are amazing, so friendly. Waking up to Aggys laugh, just great! Were sorry to leave and wished we had booked to stay two weeks. Will definitely return   Room Tip: There are no kettles or cups in the room. We emailed before arrival requesting a kettle and all room... See more room tips",4
"We had been recommended to this hotel by friends and how pleased we was. From the time we arrived to the time we left, everything was perfect. The hotel is graded as 3 star with 28 rooms, all simply but pleasantly decorated. Big enough pool with a jacuzzi, large floating bean bags to lay on and relax whilst getting a tan. Bar area by the pool has a very good selection of drinks, try the milkshakes, and also has a bar menu for lunch. We had lunch by the pool 3 times and each time, excellent food. One of the best chicken salads and great chips I've had. Now for the important piece of this review. If the star rating was based of the staff this would be graded 5. All the staff were great, so very helpful, genuinely friendly and nothing was to much for them. Each time we ventured around the island, they made sure we had all the info needed, booked attractions, restaurants, taxi's, nothing was to much trouble. We will definitely be going back, one to visit on staff alone.   Room Tip: 3 floor (top) See more room tips",4
"Well it was what was expected and more after reading the other reviews. Aggie and her staff are so welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast buffet was a delious mixture of hot food ( scrambled egg, bacon, various frittatas, boiled eggs) lovely breads ,croissants, cold meats and cheeses, yoghurts, cereals. Rooms lovely free wifi, safe and air con.There is a small fridge/mini bar too ( you pay for what you drink). One thing the bar food is amazing.",3
"We fell in love with Hotel 28 on our 5 night stay in Kamari. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a relaxed and happy atmosphere. Our room was perfect and so clean, though the wifi did not work very well there. The pool area is really lovely, with water bean bags to lounge about on and a great little pool bar. Breakfast was delicious, a large spread with variety of foods. The number 1 thing we loved about Hotel 28 has to be the staff. I have never met such friendly and helpful people, they organised tours for us, booked a rental car for us, made restaurant reservations for us, gave us countless recommendations on things to do, places to go, restaurants etc all around the island. They all really took the time to get to know us, from the girls at reception, the bar, the porter and they all came out to wave us goodbye as we were leaving. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!",3
Just had our seventh holiday at 28 and already booked in for next year!! I cannot praise Argiro Vasso Elina Mimosa Stellios the chef and all the lovely cleaning ladies enough they make us feel so special when we are there we feel like part of the family!!! The hotel is perfect in every way clean comfortable and the staff you would never find better people anywhere!!! Argiro! what a girl !!!!! she is like a second daughter !!!! her infectious laugh smile and her knowledge is amazing!! Argiro is 28 !!! we can't wait for next year! So if you are thinking of booking do it !!!   Room Tip: All good but we like a room on the back with the mountain view See more room tips,3
"Let me start by saying this Hotel is more like a home than a Hotel! Aggie, Stelios Vasso & Ilena are the most friendly & helpful staff at any Hotel we have stayed in. As already commented on, Aggies now legendary ""Good Morning"" ""Good Morning"" breakfast welcome will live with me for a very long time! With regards to the Hotel facilities, we chose a room facing the pool on the top floor which had sun in the morning but was nice & cool evening time. The rooms are a good size and were kept spotlessly clean by Fadma (our cleaning lady) with clean towels every day and clean bedding when required as well. After hiring a car for 2 days and seeing all the Island we agreed that Kamari was definitely the best resort to stay in with plenty of restaurants & bars to choose from. A couple of our favourites were To Topaki for fantastic Mezes (warning don't order too many dishes as they are big portions) and Alexanders. A little tip instead of fighting to get something to eat at Oia or Thira to watch the sunset get a taxi up to Pygos (25-30 euro return) about 15 mins from Kamari, book a table at Rosemarys restaurant (on the rooftop) order the special Pork Steak (the best I have ever tasted!) and watch the sunset descend on the whole island....""Stunning""We enjoy visiting the Greek Islands and we will return to Santorini in a few years time to this Hotel (hopefully it will still be available) with the incredible staff Once again many thanks Aggie for making our stay a fantastic experience.   Room Tip: We had room 303 which was perfect for chilling before going out in the evening. See more room tips",3
"Lovely hotel, immaculately clean and maintained. staff are amazing, friendly, know everyone by name, extremely helpfull, advised us where to go what to see and how to get there. They even ordered us take away pizza one night when we got back really late after a day trip.wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would love to go back.Found one particular restaurant that we loved Perigiali, food was great (and I'm a really fussy eater!) waiters were fantastic, we ate there 4 times out of 5 nights!Loved Santorini and would love to go back one day.",3
"The Hotel staff are fantastic cannot praise them enough Aggies greeting every morning makes your day such a happy person. She leads a brilliant staff group. Hotel is so relaxed and you start your holiday as soon as you walk through the door. The young girl at reception (very pretty but cant remember her name sorry) was a font of knowledge advised us on the best eateries, booked taxis and tables for special nights. Words cannot describe the service we received The bar service at the pool was good Stellios albeit he is a West Ham fan (ah well can't have it all !!) is also a great help ,I saw him go out of his way to help a young couple during our stay. Keep it up 28 Should have really said it was rubbish to keep the place a secret however the secret is out. Hope to see them all again but didnt enjoy the airport what a shambles.   Room Tip: Pool views we had 204 very good on middle floor See more room tips",2
"This place is absolutely phenomenal.Hotel is clean and lovely, breakfast is amazing with lots of selection. Pool is lovey with beds and bean bags in pool.It's the staff that really make this place truly magical- they welcome you from the first moment you step off the bus, always remember your name, will recommend restaurants and book anything for you! We had such a special time here and it was really the hotel and staff that made it so special.Would go back in a heartbeat and felt so sad leaving! If you're thinking about booking..DO IT!",1
This was our second visit to this hotel and we were not disappointed. It's great because it's 800 metres or so out of town but easily accessible. What to say about the staff that hasn't already been said? Wonderful. What a team. Love them,0
"Simply booked this hotel on the back of the reviews. I am very fussy & trawl through trip advisor for every thing! And everything everyone says about this hotel & staff is true. I have never been made to feel soo welcome while away. The hotel recommended things for us to do then proceeded to book us tables at restaurants, booked our car hire & our boat trip. Everything for us was made effortless. The absolutely highlight for me was the floating beanbags I grabbed a book & floated around the pool & everytime I feel sound asleep!!! I have never been soo relaxed. Thankyou all at Hotel 28 for one of my most memorable holidays ever! Oooh & listen out for Aggy's laugh, it's very contagious & made me laugh every morning",3
One of the best hotels i have ever stayed in..not in a luxury kind ofvway .but was relaxed..immaculate rooms and hotel..The staff are amazing..aggie has customer service skills to die for .Stellios makes the most delicious cocktails and directions to the best local restaurants and sunsets..Really really wonderful breakfasts..nothing too much bother ..   Room Tip: Spotless Comfortable..perfect See more room tips,3
"The staff add a real personal touch. They are all so friendly and remember your name. They recommend the less touristy spots.A real lovely adults only place which is very quiet. Plus you can use the facilities of the other recently refurbished placed on the sea front named Bellonias Villas. I've never experienced customers service like it.The bar food is simple but lovely. Rooms comfortable, the only fault I can find is the air con a little noisy.Had a great week!!!!!   Room Tip: Pool view for morning sun, mountain view for rated noon sun See more room tips",1
"From the first step off the coach the staff here make you feel special. Situated on the outskirts of Kamari, just 10 mins walk to the beach front and lots of tavernas. Rooms are a good size with dressing table, large double bed with fantastic mattresses and wash basin. Main room has air conditioning and fridge. Good size wardrobe with hangers and safe. Wet room with toilet and large walk-in shower. Towels changed daily, beach towels changed when you want and bedding changed if you use request card. We asked for a kettle which was supplied. Breakfast was really good with hot and cold options. The staff is what makes this place so special. Good pool with floating bean bags and pool bar. Only thing missing was umbrellas. Thank you all and best wishes, Aggie, Stelios, Vasso, Elina, Mimoza, and Yannis. Also, you can use the sister hotel Bellonias Villas on beach front. Great sun beds with Vagelis who looks after you.   Room Tip: Pool side rooms have morning/afternoon sun. Mountain view has late afternoon/evening sun. See more room tips",1
"Once again Santorini has shown its colours with extremely welcoming and helpful staff with some very infectious laughter! Whilst a 5 -10 min walk to the beach (depending on which end of Kamari Beach you're aiming for) this place has a great pool, decent enough buffet breakfast and a pool side bar. The floating bean bags for the pool are great and there's plenty of space around the pool! We only stayed a night but had a great welcome from everyone and would recommend this hotel. Ideally try and book one of the rooms overlooking the pool with their own little balcony's",0
"We had two weeks at the beginning of June , if I had known I would have prefered a room facing the mountain because we overlooked the pool so it didn't feel very private. Having said that though it was still lovely. We had everything we needed. The pool and bar were great , loved the floating bean bags. The staff are all fantastic, Aggi is wonderful, so helpful with top tips on where to visit. We hired a scooter so got to see most of the island. Santorini is so beautiful and the people are so friendly.",2
"We stayed at this hotel for 10 days and had an amazing time. The hotels lovely, clean and comfortable. The location is great and the staff are fabulous! They helped us with everything from recommending places to eat, arranging our car hire and helping us plan day trips. We had a perfect stay and would recommend to anyone.",3
"We have just come back from a week's holiday, staying at this hotel. Funnily enough I didn't check out the Trip Advisor reviews until after I booked it! I need not have worried, they were all excellent and I agree with them.This hotel is in a really good position, a 10 minute walk to the beach front and town with all the restaurants and shops etc.The accommodation is simple but really very, very good. Rooms either overlook the pool or the Terrace at the rear of the hotel. Planes do come in to the airport across the sea but they are not intrusive and we really didn't notice them.The pool area is very peaceful, never a problem getting onto a sun-bed, other guests come and go and there is minimal hogging or reserving sun-beds. There is a small bar open from 10 until late and there is food served from about 12 until 6, it's a simple menu with salads, burgers and souvlaki. Breakfast is very comprehensive with some a selection that would put some large hotel chains to shame.A couple of points though, it would be nice to see the shower area tiled, I know that it's cleaned every day but it looked a bit scruffy. The shower tap needed milli-metric precision to get the right temperature and how about selling some snacks (crisps, nuts) at the bar?Finally, the staff are fantastic, Aggie, Stelios, Elina and Vasso were all really helpful, I've never been personally greeted at a hotel before and they also waved us goodbye - fantastic!",1
Adult only Hotel 28 is a little oasis of calm in Kamari. Simple and stylishly Greek it is spotlessly clean and offers its guests the warmest welcome. From the first smile on arrival to the farewell hug the staff here just can't do enough for you. It's the incredible Agie ( whose heart is as big as her laugh) that leads the most loving team who make it their business to get to know you and go the extra mile every day. We will be back.,1
If your going to Santorini this is the best place to stay. There are slightly prettier areas to go and visit but this hotel is the best place to have as your base. Beautiful pool and food and the people can not do enough to mak your holiday th best in the world. I have stayed at 5* hotels in barbados and dubai but had the best service here.   Room Tip: You may be able to have the one with the ginormous balcony if it's a special occasion! See more room tips,0
"We have stayed in this hotel for a week. The rooms are nice, nice pool with a pool bar and very very helpful personnel. Great location for excursions on the island. Very helpful in recommending things todo, places to eat etc. great!Only reason for not giving 5 points is that there are not enough sun beds with some shade.",0
"Recently returned from our second visit, and really can't add to what has already been said. We literally love the place. The whole ethos behind the hotel is to provide you with a comfortable, relaxing and hassle free holiday and it more than lives up to that as the WONDERFUL staff make that happen for you. Agi, Vaso & Stelios know all there is to know between them and always deliver, and always with a smile too.Everyone who stays here is of the same mind-set - rest and relaxation in a stress-free environment and that only adds to the atmosphere. I can honestly say that I have never been so relaxed on a holiday and as returning guests, we were made to feel like long-lost family members on checking-in.All of the other reviews on here tell you everything you need to know about the hotel and the resort. All I will say is that if you are looking to spend your holidays in a relaxed, semi-private, hassle-free environment with like minded folk, then this is where you need to be.... Brilliant!",3
"This hotel did not disappoint at all. We were given probably the warmest welcome to a hotel I have ever had, and it didnt stop there, the staff, namely Aggie, Vasso and Stelios were amazing and couldnt do enough to help you. The hotel is in a quiet location, and is a 10 minute walk from the beach and restaurants of Kamari. The whole hotel is clean and well looked after. The food was great, we didnt have a bad meal at breakfast or lunch and there was a great selection available. We went for a drink at the hotel bar before going to dinner most evenings and it was lovely to chat to Stelios,the barman and other people staying at the hotel. Of course, you if you want to keep to yoursleves, then this wasnt a problem either. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again,and would recommend to anyone. I can completely understand the number one spot on TA and the brilliant reviews other guests have left.   Room Tip: I liked our mountain view room, had the sun in late afternoon and was more private than the pool vie... See more room tips",4
"Set in a quiet location just a 10 minute walk to the beach and the numerous bars and restaurants of Kamari you will find hotel 28. The facilities are excellent , the rooms well appointed and the food of extremely good quality. But what makes this hotel special are the staff. They take friendly and attentive to the next level. Nothing is too much trouble and it was apparent that they cared.",4
"Our second visit to Santorini, and the first time at this hotel, partly based on the good reviews we had seen on trip adviser. It lived up to our expectations, and as a result, we had a lovely stay.As all have commented previously, the team are just brilliant, nothing is too much trouble and thus we received lots of helpful suggestions and tips with regards places to visit and restaurants etc. Room was very minimalistic and great with a view of the pool, the balcony was pleasantly in the shade in the afternoon onwards. Breakfast consisted of a good choice and selection of hot and cold buffet items, which we could not fault.We had a lovely relaxed and chilled holiday, and will look to return again",3
"What a fantastic stay we had at Hotel 28! When we arrived Aggie came out to greet us off the coach which was lovely! I've never had that at any other hotel in the world! Very welcoming! Aggie, Vaso and Elina were all fabulous and very helpful. They all gave fantastic recommendations about restaurants, where to visit on the island, booked trips for us, even carried our cases! The rooms are good value for money, clean linen and towels everyday, and absolutely spotless (as was the rest of the hotel). Breakfast was lovely, continental with a few hot choices. The lunch menu was lovely, I loved the Greek salad! Fab selection of cocktails too. Very chilled out around the pool. A 10 minute walk to Kamari beach. It's in a perfect location away from the hustle and bustle of the main strip. I shall miss Aggies laugh!I will definitely return to Hotel 28, I simply cannot recommend it enough! Thank you for such a wonderful stay.",2
"Wonderful staff at this hotel. They go out of their way to make everything fantastic. Stelios even went to the local supermarket to buy me a toothbrush and toothpaste as I was too busy to go. They are fantastic. Lovely rooms with great toiletries and air conditioning and the hotel is just 5 mins from the beach. Can't recommend these guys and this hotel enough, it was a great experience. Drop in at their sister hotel Bellonia Villas too for coffee or food as its a fabulous setting with spectacular pool and seating area on the beach. Hotel 28 was wonderful all round.",3
"Another fabulous holiday to Hotel 28, our 6th year running.Excellent service from all the staff managed admirably by Argiro as usual, with support from Elina, Stellios and Vaso. Breakfast was always good but improved this year by much more choice, of cooked, continental and fresh fruits along with usual cereals, coffee etc.The Greek yoghurt and apple jam are both to die for. Varied lunches served at the pool bar are also excellent. Large cocktail list to choose from and all drinks of good quality. The whole hotel is kept spotless by the team, with fresh towels daily and regular change of bed linen.The rooms are minimalist but the beds are very comfortable. A previous year a guest advised me they are the best they have slept on in Greece.Pool area lovely but in need of extra sun beds and a bit of an update however we are advised that is expected to be sorted before next year. Excellent news as we have already booked for our seventh visit June 2017. Can't wait to return.",7
"This was our second visit and it just gets better. The breakfasts were amazing and all the cakes, jams etc were home made. I loved the apple jam - yummy. The staff are just incredible especially Aggie. Nothing is too much trouble and she knows everyone by their name. You will never forget her laugh especially at breakfast. We did not need an alarm!! The pool area is lovely with double sun beds, some in the shade and beanbags which you can use to float in the pool and fall asleep! Great fun. The hotel is in a very quiet part of Kamari but near to the beach and restaurants. The restsurants line a pedestrianised promenade and there are loads to choose from. We hired a car and saw most of the island. It is stunning.We had an amazing time at hotel 28 and will definitely return in the future along many other people. It is just a very special hotel as are all the staff.   Room Tip: Back rooms have mountain view and sun in evening. See more room tips",2
This is the 15th time we visited this hotel or Bellonias. Always nice to come back. We will for sure come back as soon as possible. I will recommend this to everyone who wants to stay at place in Santorini that are close to the sea and close to the airport. Love the staff and love the hotel!,2
"What can we say that has not already been said about Hotel 28, it was simply the best we have stayed in within Greece. Aggie and her team, Katrina, Helena, Vaso and how could we forget Stelios, were all very friendly and greeted us by name each day and would go above and beyond to ensure you have a great stay. Breakfasts were just great with everything you could want for breakfast. Had a ground floor mountain view which was nice as you got the afternoon sun. Free Wi-Fi around the hotel and in the rooms and also a safe with in the room and free air con. Towels changed everyday and sheets could be changed when you wanted them to. Pool great with double sunbeds and also bean bags to float around the pool, towels provided. Staff were all very knowledgeable about where to go and how to get there, and would always book a table and a taxi if required. 10-15 minutes walk to the beach and all the tavernas who all try to get you to eat at the best place in town, make your own choice, try them all, didn't have a bad meal at any we tried. (separate reviews)   Room Tip: Mountain views get afternoon sun, pool views gets morning sun See more room tips",3
"What an amazing holiday. The staff at the hotel really made our holiday. Recommending restaurants, places to visit etc. All restaurants they told us about were great. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms comfortable. Really nice breakfast. We had mountain view which I think was quieter than pool view. Didn't have problem finding sun beds around the beautiful pool. Really nice pool menu for snacks. 5/10 mins walk into centre. Not a problem in june but not sure how i would enjoy in august! Can't give better recommendation but to say we have booked again for next year.",3
"Perfectly formed hotel just a short walk from the seafront. We spent 10 days here and loved it. The staff are incredible, the rooms very clean and spacious, and the partner hotel (Villa Bellionas) makes for an amazing double. Cannot recommend highly enough. During your stay I recommend walking over the hill into Parissa - takes about two hours from beach to beach and is well worth it.",3
Forget every other review written about this hotel because they have all understated this fantastic superb hotel. The staff must be the best in the world and the big hotel chains could learn a lot from them. How can anyone remember every guests name...but they do. Breakfast is adequate and the Greek yogurt and honey is great. The pool area is great too with areas which stay in the shade all day. Being child free is a bonus. We used santorini car hire for four days. The car was delivered to the hotel at no extra charge. Having a car let us visit all the little villages without relying on the local buses. The tavernas along the front were all very good and is was great fun picking out where to eat each night. The hotel staff were great when it came to leaving. They provided facilities for showers and changing. Do not book anywhere else in Kamari.,4
"Well where do I begin,OK at the beginning,We arrived at the hotel around 8pm and as soon as we got out the car the staff were their with a big smile and helping hands and would not let us carry our cases.In reception we met a wonderful lady by the name of ""Aggie"" (what a star she is she cannot do enough for you)we were put in a incorrect room but this was not the hotels fault but Thompsons had yet again fluffed up another booking.we were moved to the correct room the following morning swiftly with help yet again from the staff.The rooms are pleasantly done, very spacious and spotlessly clean.a fridge with mini bar which was priced the same as the bar prices at the pool.breakfasts were excellent with a fair choice of hot and cold foods.bar foods were magnificent or should say megaloprepis (greek) ìåãáëïðñåðÞò""praise the chef""mmmmmmmmmmmm what next !the pool was excellent and very refreshing with massive Bean bags to float around on also a working jacuzzi plenty of sunbeds which were all double and comfortable and yes myself & Irene did belt out some ZZZZZZ's hehehe.the grounds are well maintained and very clean n tidyall in all I can't fault the place in-fact id say a ""top notch place"".mmmmm Aggie Aggie Aggie this lady woke me up every morning at 7am. what a laugh she has, very irresistible cant wait to hear it again.Vasso now she's the bar lady and she has a smile all day long never stops working and never shuts up. hohoho cant say enough but all these guys n gals that work their made our holiday one to remember.WELL DONE HOTEL 28 luv you all see ya soon we hopesas efcharisto olous ( óáò åõ÷áñéóôþ üëïõò )""Aggie when you read this you may laugh"" Keep in touch xxxxx   Room Tip: I think all were good but a g/floor pool room is great for getting to the pool from your verander See more room tips",2
"I have travelled a great deal and can honestly say when myself and a friend visited I cant think of a bad word to say. The staff were amazing, trust me with Aggie you dont need an alarm clock (sorry Aggie) The hotel clean food good and met some lovely people. I love children but mine are grown up and have grandchildren, so we chose this hotel for that reason. Santorini is not for children. Final word booked with Thompson not impressed however Christian the hotel rep is great.",1
Excellent in all respects. The staff were very pleasant and always there to help with any request.Rooms were clean and comfortable. Clean towels every day. Breakfasts were the best we have had in 30 years of visiting Greece. Pool area including the snack bar was well laid out. Comfortable beds around the pool but alas there were only five beds with any protection from the sun and heat. No umbrella's anywhere. Other than this a week to remember. As Arnie said we will be back,3
"Perfect holiday Aggie and her staff are so helpful. vasso worked on the pool bar had a smile on her face all day , breakfast very nice on the terrace , rooms could do with a little updating but the staff make all the difference in this hotel thanks again Aggie for making our wedding and holiday so special see you next year Lesley and mark x",1
"Aggie the manager is so helpful with a laugh you will never forget and she can not do enough for you to have a good time. The other staff Vasso, Everline and Sterios are just as welcoming and will do anything to make your holiday great.It is not far from the beach and all the lovely restaurants. The bus service is cheap and takes you round most of the island. We did a couple of booked tours to see the sunset in Ioa and also the boat trip.",2
"Everything I had read on Trip Advisor prior to our holiday proved to be true. Best was the staff, all of them without exception were fantastic!! They couldn't do enough for you. All spoke good English. The hotel was great we had a nice balcony at the back with a ""mountain view.""The breakfasts were good with a wide range of alternatives. Access to the beach was a five minute stroll. The rooms were clean and cleaned extensively every day. We will definitely return. Even off duty staff came back to say goodbye when we were leaving.   Room Tip: We loved our room and balcony. I would have been less happy with ground floor on the pool side where... See more room tips",2
"We stayed at hotel 28 in late May early June, the location is approx 10 minutes from Kamari beach and all the restaurants. The hotel is nice and clean, the breakfast is very good with a choice of hot and cold food.The staff at the hotel are absolutely fantastic and always welcome you with a smile. A nice touch is the fact that the safe and air con is included in the price. Couldn't fault this hotel, if you stay here you will not be disappointed.   Room Tip: Very clean, decent size room with sink, good size shower room and toilet good quality toiletries pro... See more room tips",3
"We have just returned following a week at this great hotel. The staff are brilliant Agy, Vaso, Elene and Stellios made the week - always going out of their way to be friendly and helpful with a smile on their face . They seemed very genuine and couldn't do enough for you. They are Knowledgable about the fantastic Island of Santorini. Breakfast is plentiful with fresh croissants continually being topped up. Lunch at the pool bar tasty. 5-10 min walk to the beach and main strip of restaurants . Sun beds are great and comfortable - we didn't want to leave the floating pool bean bags ! 10 min walk to the brilliant outdoor cinema Thank you for a great week. We hope to return .",2
"We are just leaving this lovely little hotel after 2 weeks on this glorious island, the staff at this hotel really make this place special they go out of their way to ensure you have the best possible holiday, Agi recommended some fabulous restaurants and booked us some amazing tables at the restaurants, our favourite was Argo in Fira, the views are stunning! The hotel I feel is tired and in need of a refurb and it isn't a boutique hotel as we would expect in England. There are also only 16 double sunbeds round the pool and some mornings people were up at 6am grabbing them and one particular group of 6 always had extra beds some in the sun and some out, this is obviously not the fault of the hotel but due to the ignorance of other holiday makers. The food round the pool and for breakfast was lovely. We looked at other hotels whilst we were out here and some of them were stunning. We would probably not stay at this hotel again, although you would go along way to find such accommodating staff. One word of warning the showers are terrible, they are either scalding hot or ice cold and this can be really dangerous doesn't seem to be any in between.",2
Every once in a while you find a hotel and location that delivers on all fronts.just read all of the previous reveiws on this hotel and you will get a very acurate idea of this place. Well done to all staff. Effortless and without fault. We are only 2 days into our stay and want to book a return visit already.,1
"This is our 5th time at this hotel. The welcome is still as warm as the 1st time if not better. The hotel is amazing and the 28 team are brilliant. Argiro with her infectious laugh, makes sure everyone is ok at breakfast. She is there to offer helpful advice on places to visit and knows all the best places to eat. She is more than happy to arrange a taxi and book restaurants. She's an absolute gem. Vaso takes care of the bar during the day. She's got a cracking sense of humour and pulls the best pint. Elena - a new addition to the team looks after reception, also very helpful and a lovely girl. Stelios takes care of things in the evening. He can't do enough for you. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the 28 team. A special thank you to Spiros for going out of his way and looking after us when our 9 week old grandson took poorly. (He was staying in another hotel)Really appreciate your help. Can't thank you enough.The rooms as usual are kept spotless by the wonderful cleaning ladies.The pool is a very comfortable and relaxing place to chill out, with the floating bean bags and extremely comfy double sun beds. The pool area looks very boutique !The breakfasts are lovely and set you up for the day. The food in the bar during the day is of a very high standard. In fact delicious. The hotel is approx a comfortable 10 mins stroll to the front where you'll find a host of eateries.This hotel is that good we've already booked again for 2017.If you have booked this wonderful hotel you are for a real treat",3
"We had a fantastic stay here and were very well looked after by Agi Eleni Passou (splet wrong? but sounds like that for the lady behind the bar) and all the cleaners who keep this placing looking great. Breakfast was amazing and entertaining, the pool was lovely and clean, padded loungers comfortable and inflatable bean bags for drifting around the pool lovely and relaxing.",4
Amazing experience. Nice room. Air conditioning works perfectly. The breakfast was delicious. The staff is sweet and amazing. The pool is beautiful and the lounge beanbags are the best! Staff calls you by name. The hotel also has a sister hotel at the beach. It's a really easy 10 minute walk. I can't wait to come back!,2
"We visited santorini to plan our wedding and scope out the island for our guests. the welcome we received was lovely and the staff continued to be happy friendly and talkative throughout our 9 day stay. The girls helped my other half plan a surprise birthday cake for me which was delivered to me at breakfast - adorable - then in the evening after a boat trip in the hot sun I was unfortunately extremely poorly so the next day Agi very kindly put together a breakfast tray for me along with a cute vase of flowers so I could eat in our room. the staff really do make the hotel. This was our first time at a small hotel.. we are used to the massive allinclusive vibe but we did love it. Modern, tasteful, classy and very clean. You can't go wrong. Vasou makes an amazing cocktail ;) If you book this hotel you will not be disappointed.. hopefully see you guys next year for our big day x x",3
"We only go to small family run hotels, and this one is perfect, it is just a few minutes walk from the beach, breakfast is good but what makes it very special is the staff, Aggi and her team are very very good. Watch out for her laugh haha, it is only a short way from Fira with regular busses however a taxi is only 15€, throughly recommend.",3
"We have just returned and just miss the place so much, The best hotel we have stayed in for service, friendly staff, and the hotel was always clean. The pool area has the sun most of the day with a great pool bar run by Vasso who is great fun. Agi and Helena are the nicest hosts we have ever come across in a hotel , nothing is to much trouble for them. We loved santorini and will return one day. THANKS FOR A WONDER FUL HOLIDAY . steve and Helen.   Room Tip: All rooms are fantastic , back view mountains . front pool view, and sea view from top rooms. See more room tips",2
"We had a fantastic stay at the hotel during May 2016. The staff here do such a great job and go the extra mile for you. They knew all the guests by name and we're always on hand for advice about what to do and where to eat etc..The hotel/pool area is nice, clean and relaxing. We would definitely return here!",1
"What to say that hasn't been sent a hundred times before? This ticks so many boxes and we simply had the best time here on holiday. I travel alot with work and have been lucky to stay in some of the world's best hotels, and in terms of service levels Hotel 28 is up there with the best. All members of staff do all they can to ensure you have the best time, whether it be recommending local restaurants (and booking them for you), booking taxis, or simply spending time to get to know you and making you feel like you are the only guests in the hotel. The hotel is clean and perfect for what we needed. Good free wifi, fantastic food (my partner cannot recommend the turkey bagel enough!) and drinks. We are returning with friends and family for our wedding on the island later in the summer and I am already on countdown to return to Hotel 28 :-)",1
"We stayed at Hotel 28 for 4 nights and what a great experience it was. Agira and her team are simply amazing, they know everyone's names and treated us all as family. The hotel is beautiful, modern, clean and snazzy without the fuss and pomp! We loved it! We needed some time to relax and rejuvenate - this was the perfect place. It's not too far from the beach and restaurants - if you don't mind a 10 minute walk each way. It was a beautiful introduction to Santorini, we will be back :)",1
"We enjoyed our two week holiday so much, we opted to stay an extra four days! We received great service from the team at the hotel, with recommendations, information and restaurant bookings etc. Nothing is too much trouble. The accommodation is extremely clean and the pool area relaxed with white leather mattresses to recline away the day. The beach is within walking distance and has many free sunbeds available through the restaurants which line the beach front. There are a variety of high class and budget eateries to suit all tastes.The rooms in the hotel are well equipped with hairdryers, safe, free air conditioning, tv etc and wifi available throughout.The bar area around the pool was quiet during our stay but stayed open in the evening. Would recommend this hotel for its friendly and attentive service and excellent facilities.",3
"We found the ""Welcome"" received at Hotel 28 was quite simply the best we have ever had.This continued throughout our stay, with excellent service some above and beyond expectation.If you are thinking of an island trip - talk to the girls before booking - they will even book for you, but we found their recommendations spot on.",1
"Very friendly and extremely well run hotel located 5 to 10 mins from the beach. Not sure whether this is Adults only ,certainly some children did appear but probably only visiting other guests, certainly no facilities for accommodating their needs. Breakfast okay but strange scrambled egg ! Local buses (or rather coaches) run to all parts of the island via Fira and are plentiful and not expensive. Sister hotel on the waterfront allows use of all facilities and is good for lunchtime food but there are better restaurants available for dinner in the evening.Some agencies advertise the pool as having a hot tub, this is incorrect, the water temperature is the same throughout and is not heated.",2
"We booked as part of a large family wedding party, from our personal welcome to organising of trips, friendliness and cleanliness, this hotel had it all. Food was excellent, bar staff great, pool clean and lovely, and a special mention to Aggia, Elina, Stelio and Vasso. Thankyou so much from all of us. A safe 5-10 min walk to the main beach, if you do go out , the staff point you in the right direction. Highly recommend !",3
"16 weeks and counting till our 3rd visit, My wife and her friends are staying at the sister Hotel Bellonias for a week and then we are up at 28 for the 2nd week.Both are just great and would highly recommend.",2
"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! The staff are helpful, kind, caring and wonderful! I'm still here and planning a return visit. They can't do enough for you. They're a credit to their bosses. Our room has been cleaned everyday, with fresh towels for the beach. The staff have helped us organise trips and get better deals! They really look after you.",2
"Absolutely beautiful hotel with amazing staff who were incredibly helpful and couldn't do enough to help and only a 5 minute walk to the beach, restaurants and bars, as well as the bus stop where the buses run every 30 mins to Fira and Oia",5
"The staff at 28 Boutique Hotel are the best that we have ever met, nothing was too much trouble and they were always ready and willing to help and advise. The local buses are good 1.80 euro per journey.   Room Tip: We liked our room which overlooked the mountains and got the early evening sunshine, perfect for sit... See more room tips",3
"What a fantastic experience! This hotel has everything, amazing staff, gorgeous pool, super cool atmosphere, beautiful rooms and just a hop and a skip away from the busy Kamari strip. It's about 5 minute walk from the main strip but you'll be glad not to be in the thick of things, this place is truly a sanctuary and the best!!",2
"We stayed here for a week at the beginning of May. This was the start of the season, the staff were full of enthusiasm and very friendly and helpful. Despite the fact our thomson rep came to the hotel every morning we still went to the hotel staff for advice and recommendations for the island. They booked reservations for restaurants we visited and also arranged car hire for us. The hotel itself is very clean and tidy, you are welcomed into a courtyard area with palm trees and rustic seating areas. The reception is nice and bright and clean with a massive bookshelf full of books that you can borrow during your stay. Breakfast area is nicely organised and the food is very good. There is a large varied selection and always plenty available. You can sit indoors or out to eat, the outdoor area is on a terrace overlooking the pool and entrance courtyard. Very nice and peaceful with views of the mountain.The room we had was 305. Third floor on the pool side. We had sea views, pool view and mountain views. It was so nice, plenty of room, very tidy and lovely modern decor. Nice big double shower in the en suite. The room was cleaned every day. The pool area is very comfortable. Large double size sun beds on 3 sides of the pool with the pool bar on the other side. Pool bar serves lunch, snacks and drinks. Plenty of selection and all at a reasonable price. We ate lunch here a couple of times and it was very nice food. Highly recommend this island to visit but make sure you stay at this hotel. It was the perfect stay for us, we loved the location of the hotel, it was handy for covering all parts of the island and the seafront of Kamari is a 5 minute walk. We enjoyed every minute at this hotel and would love to return.",4
"Really enjoyed our stay here, staff were very friendly and helpful. Gave us some good tips on what to do and where to go. Location was perfect, close enough to the beach and shops but far enough away from the noise of the town. Everywhere in the hotel was very clean and well kept. Food was the only slight down point for us, although a good spread at breakfast, the hot food was luke warm by time of eating as was left out in the open. Despite this overall it was a fantastic stay and we would definitely return!",0
"We stayed here at the end of July, and we loved every second of it, Rooms are spacious and clean and the staff are so friendly and helpful.We enjoyed so much we have booked again to stay here in October and we can't wait.",0
"I had my share of travel experience and I can say Greece is one of the most beautiful places I have been to. Not only cause of the amazing scenery BUT the amazing kindness of the Greeks. The staff at Annassa were just the best and most friendly people we encountered. They go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one, they made all kinds of site seeing arrangements for us, took their time calling for the best possible options to ensure a great experience at the best prices. The rooms are immaculate, super big, it's like a full apartment or better. The free breakfast, it was a full spread with fresh everything, hot breakfast, fruits, desserts and tons, more, all amazing. It is super clean, and the best location! 1 block away from the pedestrian walk right on the beach. It's more like a mile plus long street art fair, food, cafes, food, anything you ever wanted! Just a lock from Annassa! I loved Santorinni and Annassa made it perfect.   Room Tip: All rooms are deluxe suites and they really mean it. See more room tips",0
Absolutely outstanding place! I booked this hotel for the night before and night of my wedding! The staff were the nicest I have encountered in my life! They were so kind and helpful in so many ways and even decorated the suite for our wedding night and left us drinks etc.i will 100% stay here when I return.not to mention how beautiful and spacious our room was! Thank You so much anassa deluxe suites.you were the icing on the cake!,0
"Just returned from a wonderful week at this beautiful hotel. All the positive remarks you read on here are a true reflection on this hotel. The staff and management are absolutely superb and really can't do enough for you. The hotel is spotless and in an excellent position for the beach, restaurants etc. I would definitely return to this hotel.",0
"Our Santorini vacation at Anassa Hotel was absolutely amazing. Everything that we paid for and more. Mrs Fotini the owner took care of us from the moment we step foot in the hotel. She gave us a room upgrade, always making sure me, my husband and our 2 sons enjoy our stay there. She is an extremely kind and professional person. All hotel personal are very very good. Always ready to help, they arranged our car rental, even negociated the price. The hotel itself is very well maintained, room and pool area. Very good position 2 minutes from the beach, from the supermarket, from the bus station and all shops. We fully recommend this hotel to anyone!! We can't thank them enough!!",0
"Stayed for two weeks July/August, fantastic hotel. Room beautiful, big, clean and comfortable. Fotini and Zaf on reception knowledgeable and nothing too much trouble for them. Rest of the staff friendly and pleasant as they went about their work. All this made a really pleasant stay and we would definitely recommend this hotel.",0
"Very close to the beach, this beautifully maintained suites property is a fantastic value. Our room was gorgeous. It was pristine. It was beautifully designed. It was comfortable. It was spacious. The pool area is also immaculate and comfortable, as well as well designed. The breakfast was one of the highest quality hotel breakfast buffets I've ever had anywhere at any price. It was smallish, though there were a very respectable number of selections. The food that was there was unbelievable.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Anassa for the first part of our honeymoon and we had a fantastic time! Zaf and the other woman who works the front desk (so sorry I forgot her name!) are phenomenal in every way! They gave wonderful dinner recommendations (Almira was our fav!), made the dinner reservations for us, were available for any questions we had about the ferry and other inquiries about traveling around the island. Hanging out poolside with a drink in the evening was fantastic too! Our room was AMAZING and so huge! The A/C worked very well and the breakfast had a large selection of greek and other common items. We LOVED staying here and will be back!",1
"Anassa would be difficult to beat. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful. The attention to detail throughout the hotel made it really special. It was the cleanest accommodation I have ever stayed in - spotless! Breakfasts were on a generous buffet style basis.There are walks, tours, shops, lovely restaurants, the beach and a short bus ride away is Fira, from where you can get buses to other parts of the island.A massage can be arranged. Maria did mine and it's the best massage I have ever had from someone who is highly skilled and totally focussed.Can't recommend the place highly enough.   Room Tip: I think they are probably all excellent See more room tips",1
"Very welcoming and friendly staff, especially Zaf! Myself and family stayed here and celebrated both my birthday and wedding! The hotel staff could not be more accommodating. We stayed in the maisonette and family members in junior suites, all very spacious, clean and comfortable. This hotel added to our perfect first week in Santorini!",0
"We came to this lovely hotel for the first of our honeymoon! The suite we had was number 16 and it was very big, bathroom was also very nice. We had a little balcony for ourselves. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. They made sure our stay at the hotel was as peaceful and calm as we wanted it. We can recommend the hotel for other visitors.",0
"So pleased with this little gem, chosen due to trip advisor reviews. Small complex, imaculately clean, in walking distance of beach front strip of shops, bars and restaurants. Great local bus service from next street where you can visit most of the island via Fira. As we prepare to leave we can find no fault with hotel and think Kamari is best resort. Special mention about excellent staff, thank you all.   Room Tip: All good seemingly See more room tips",1
"The hotel is great. New, clean, spacious. It has a lovely pool and the breakfast is good. The location is excellent. Just a few minutes walk from Kamari beach, with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. But the thing that really made me give the hotel the highest score is the staff. Zef, the manager, and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to help with everything. This is the difference between a good hotel and a great hotel. And this is a great hotel!! We will return.",2
"Ideal place just 5 minutes from the beach but far enough away from all the noise you get if you stay on one of the sea front ones. Only 17 rooms, so not too many people getting in each others way. Always room on very comfortable cushioned sun loungers by the lovely outdoor pool and jacuzzi. Beautiful decor and rooms are massive and finished to a high standard with own private balcony. Breakfast ok but a bit limited, although even if they didn't provide one at all it would still get full marks. Fotina and Zaf told us all the good things to do/see (even planned some of our days) and recommended the best restaurants in Kamari and the other towns we visited. Just stay here, that's all you need to do!",1
"We have just back from a relaxing week at this hotel. Spotlessly clean accomodation which all looked brand new. Nothing too much trouble for the staff. Lovely pool, never more than 2 or 3 people in at a time and we could always get a sun bed no matter what time of day it was. Very quiet and peaceful which is just what we wanted. Would visit again.   Room Tip: Room 213 was great for us as our teenage son had the upstairs bedroom. See more room tips",1
"This hotel is located within walking distance from the famous Kamari beach, with lots of shops and restaurants around. The staff was helpful and friendly, even assisting us in renting a car. The breakfast was a good selection of bread, pizza, fruits, and juices. The room itself was nice and clean as expected. The gym works well, with one of each machine. However the property lacks a finesse in the decor/ design that makes it a truly five star luxurious experience. There was also no wifi around public areas such as the breakfast room and the gym. I would suggest this for a family or for friends traveling and looking for a homey experience, but not for a couple looking for a romantic luxurious getaway.",0
"Lovely, small family run hotel. Excellent location - only 1 block to Kamari Beach, restaurants etc. Spacious clean well furnished rooms, very friendly and helpful staff, lovely pool area and delicious breakfast. We would definitely stay here again",0
"My husband and I were given this holiday as a surprise gift for my husband's birthday and our Anniversary ,by our daughter, who came with us together with her partner. We had a two bed masionette ,it was spotlessly clean, very well equipped and had two balconies the very large one had a lovely white outdoor suite on it. Two pools, comfortable sunbeds, gym,pool bar and a freshly prepared breakfast every morning with lots of choice. The staff are the most obliging I have ever met,Fotinl gave us lots of advice and information about the area. Kamari was a beautiful resort. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, we are booking to return next year.",0
"Stayed here for 5 days. I can honestly say nothing has been too much trouble & you really do feel like a valued guest here. The place is spotless, everything you need is catered for & the staff help you with lots of local knowledge & tips. Great place to stay, can't recommend highly enough",0
"My friends , my husband and myself went to Anassa deluxe suites for my birthday in June . I did a lot of research before I booked this holiday to ensure we ticked all the boxes and it totally lived up to my expectations . It all started with our complimentary transfer to the hotel which was only 5 minutes from the airport , we were met with a smile and a cool drink .The rooms were spacious , spotless and totally air conditioned , the breakfast was fresh and replenished often with plenty of choice . We used the gym and the sauna and it had everything you could want .Without exception all the staff were incredibly friendly, always smiling ( even to the grumpy holiday makers) .The beach and restaurants were plentiful reasonably priced and 5 minutes walk from the hotel . I totally recommend hiring Quad bikes or just getting a taxi and seeing the spectacular sunset in Oia , we went to a fantastic restaurant called Sphinx in Fira . I'd also recommend Metaxi Mas which is a typical Greek taverna which had great food and traditional feel about it . We also went on a catamaran for the day around the island and visited the red and black beaches . On our last day British Airways cancelled our flight without explanation , luckily we were able to get on an easy jet flight and the staff at the Anassa were helpful until the end . I cannot recommend this place enough . Michelle",0
Excellent place very friendly stuff and helpful .Rooms were very big and clean good air-condition and wi-fi Breakfast was also very fresh and plenty to choose Location of the hotel is very nice as well within 30 min drive you can visit every place in santorini And also had a nice beach area but the people working there were not to friendly and professionals other than that everything was excellent,0
"excellent hotel has soon has you arrive you are met with a smile and with staff who will go the extra mile to help you, even though we had booked our room online when we arrived we where given the option of three other rooms to be honest we where spoilt for choice. Throughout our stay at the anassa we where spoilt by all the staff they could not do enough to please you and thank you to the cleaning staff who always put some nice touches to our room. Would I return to the anassa yes without a second thought.",0
"We are free style tourists and we do not spend a lot of time at our hotels. We expectvery clean and safe accommodations, as well as, friendly service. This hotel exceededour expectations. Hotel is fairly new and very well maintained. The room we stayed inhad a small kitchenette and a patio for us sit outside. We didn't use the kitchenette during our short stay, but the patio was great for sitting outside and smoking a Cuban cigar. Service was extraordinary. Manager bent over backwards to get my wife's lost luggage to the hotel from the airport. She also helped us make transportation arrange-mants from the Athens airport to our hotel in Athens on our return trip. That was a bigdeal since we were arriving to Athens after midnight and the metro shuts down at thattime. The hotel is a block from the beach (rocks, not sand) and the avenue of restaur-ants. Brunch was very good. We were able to rent a car on the same block as thehotel. I would highly recommend renting a car to venture around the island. We hada blast!!!",1
"The moment we arrived in the hotel reception immediately we noticed that they were very helpful with different information. They welcome us with free drinks. We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. Our room was very clean and every evening we had a good night sleep. We enjoyed our breakfast with different offers including continental, Greek and English. The swimming pool is very clean and also the sunbeds are very clean.   Room Tip: Rooms are big with lovely balcony and all the rooms have fully air conditioned See more room tips",1
"Fotini was at the front desk when we arrived, and everything she recommended for us was just.....perfect. The restaurants, the winery tour, the catamarans sailing tour....it was like she could read our minds for what we wanted. Room was well cleaned, and we enjoyed the sunny balcony. Breakfast was good, with delicious breakfast pizza, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, bread, and yogurt. Would love to stay there again. Thank you, Fotini, for everything.",1
We stayed for 3 nights with our 1yo daughter and had a great time at Anassa.The staff were friendly and great to deal with. The pool was fantastic and catered for all. Located close but not on top of the action made our stay really enjoyable! Less than a 4min walk to the beach and main strip. The room was large and had a kitchenette which helped when preparing meals for the little one. Definitely recommend.,0
"the best!!!!very clean,spacious room with good amenities.Love the jacuzzi in the bathroom.Helpful, accomodating and pleasant staff.Good breakfast.Good service.Near the beach and bus stop to other places and cheap fare.Nearby restaurants and stores.Also near the airport.Assisted us checking in with our flight to Athens.I love this place...thanks to the staff   Room Tip: i love our room,near the pool and breakfast area.I feel safe too See more room tips",0
"Stayed here 16-23 May 2016. As soon as we arrived we knew we'd found something special, it was spotlessly clean, the pool area & furniture were immaculate and our room was just stunning. The staff are very friendly and helpful answering all our questions and getting timetables for buses and boat taxis. They worked very hard to make our stay really enjoyable. The little breakfast room was a pleasure and the food was just the right combination of cereals, cooked breakfast, fruits pastries etc etc. I'm already looking to book again and look forward to seeing the team again. Dave & Laura",1
Very satisfied with my stay here. When I waked in I was given a glass of orange juice to enjoy while checking in. The concierge upgraded my my room because there was vacancy and the staff even gave me a coffee mug as a souvenir when I checked out! The amenities and location are great but the staff really made my trip incredible. Thank you Evaggelia for helping find the best excursions for me and helping me find my way around! Cheers!,0
"The hotel service was amazing, we were looked after as if we were family. The hotel was nicelycleaned each day and we were very well looked after by the reception staff and cleaners and all other staff associated with the hotel, the location was perfect close to beach and great restaurants. e met the owner Maria. Each morning we would say hello to Maria and her husband and grandson. It was something very special. Eva at the reception was amazing, Eva treated us like royalty and made our stay very very special. I totaly recomend Anassa Hotel Kamari Santorini to anyone around the world. A first class team ready to pkease the guests staying at the hotel. Thank you from the 3 of us, Antonia Carlos, Nicky,Caroline.   Room Tip: Great location, great service, good facilities. Amazing staff. A must to experiance. See more room tips",1
"Friendly staff waste no time in meeting your needs as a traveler. To ease your arrival they were able to make transportation arrangements. The rooms are spacious and offer a mini kitchenette. The pool area is small but does allow for some sunbathing. The breakfast included is decent, nothing too special. The location is very convenient, very near a bus stop. The hotel is located in a cute beach town that offers a great selection of shops, businesses and restaurants. It's nice to be removed somewhat from the major towns, Fira and Oia, as it allows you to stay off the beaten path, explore more of the island and stay away from too much of the busy. Upon checkout day, the staff made accommodation to keep our luggage and allow us to utilize the facilities. They were above and beyond in assisting our exit of the island by providing arrangements again for transportation and completing the computer check in for the flight. It was very clear that all the staff were intent to make our stay the best it could possibly be. Also note, the WiFi is free, but the connection was not always the best.",0
"The Hotel is very well run and friendly staff. All of us are Vegetarians and the morning staff went out of their way to not only accommodate our diet but alos Vegan and Gluten free corn bread was made just for us. Staff is amazing especially the fornt desk including Fotini, Katarina and the girl at reception (Sorry I cannot spell your name!). The beds could be a little better in the maissonette room, but with all the other friendlyness, we still think this is a 5 rating.. thanks",0
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful, very clean, staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. Breakfast was very good with fresh eggs, bread, yogurt, cheeses, etc. I highly recommend this place is within walking distance to one of the best beaches in Ssantorini. Excellent locations, close to the beach, restaurants and shopping.",0
"Excellent hotel, located two blocks from the beach in a very quiet neighborhood. Top service, they look after the details, are very proactive, helpful and very nice people. The hotel is beautiful and clean. I would totally go back to this hotel and completely recommend it.",0
"We just got home from here its a peaceful hotel with a very friendly owner and staff, the rooms were very nice and very clean and serviced well. The breakfast is buffet style some unusual bits for English but all the same ample selection, we had breakfast brought to our room for the first few days as the hotel had just opened and not many guests, we were very spoilt and we enjoyed sitting outside to eat. We had a wonderful Strawberry daiquiri that is a must. the restaurants in the area were plenty and ranged in price, everywhere we went the locals were friendly. The bus stop to Fira is just around the corner and its a five minute walk to the beach. All in all my Daughter and myself had a wonderful time",0
"We stayed there in August and it was a very pleasant stay. We were traveling with our 5 month old daughter so needed a place that was close to the beach , but quite. At night is was absolutely silent, and the rooms, pool and services and staff were spot on, even telling us where to get cheaper diapers! The black pebble Beach was very nice and the church grotto at the far right side of the beach was a great place to jump off the cliff into the ocean. Just follow the kids!",0
"I went with my family. After a long hard journey with a passport control that was beyond slow, we stepped into the hotel and was met by a very friendly member of staff. He showed us the way to our rooms, insisting that we'd leave our bags for him to bring to the room later. Already two meters past reception, we entered the beautiful pool area, with spotlights illuminating the facade. We were then given a choice between two equally spotless rooms with different decoration, which for me shows that the rooms are individually planned. I was surprised at how good this hotel was, having stayed the previous night at Hilton this felt more clean and modern.",0
"Peaceful location close to beach. Staff are so helpful-offering suggestions,advice,booking taxis etc.Bus stop is around corner-good service to Fira. We used taxis as we were group of 4.Great that rooms have same kitchenette.Just perfect.Will return.   Room Tip: All rooms are really quiet and well equipped See more room tips",1
"We had a wonderful stay, staff was friendly and helpful!The facilities was amazing and clean!! Close to everything Kamari.Will definitely be seeing them again soon!!Absolutely in love with this place!",0
We (a family group of 4) were there for two nights on July 2015. Our room was very good and clean where we could sleep well.Staff were very helpful giving to us indications and recommendations of beaches and places. Breakfast was delicious.We park our rented car in front of the entrance without any problem.,0
"We had a brilliant stay at the Anassa last week, staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for you. Would definitely recommend, rooms were beautiful! Kamari is great, lots of lovely tavernas and bars",0
"I stayed here with my Mum & 8 year daughter. Absolutely loved it, room spacious and spotless. Small touches like safe, fridge & pool towels are included which you normally pay extra for. The staff couldn't do enough, even lending me an ipad charger for the week because mine wouldn't work. Breakfast is lovely, sunbeds nice & comfy & my daughter says George does the best Strawberry & Peach smoothie. The hotel arrange airport transfers too which was great. Would definitely recommend and we will be back.",0
"Great small hotel, one block off beach, just north of mid beach on Kamari. Fotina and gang do a great job... friendly, attentive service. Hotel is 5+ years old they say but looks new. Very pleasant modern room w/ porch looking pool. Breakfast included is quite full and interesting. Nice pool though we are beach goers. I would say a good 4 star hotel for a very reasonable price.   Room Tip: porch overlooking pool See more room tips",0
"These guys were excellent. We had a bad experience with an on line booking with another hotel and these guys, to say the least, bent over backwards to help us. Big thank you to Fotini and team for all their help. Place is beautiful, clean. Breakfast lovely and service second to none. Pool relaxing and sun beds comfy. Close to beach and restaurants. Highly recommended.",0
"My husband and I have just returned home after a 2 week stay at the Anassa suites We have stayed at many islands and mainland Greece, but we are of the opinion that Santorini beats them allThe Anassa is a small hotel just minutes from the beach, restaurants and several shops. On arrival was given a complimentary drink and shown to our room, which was very spacious and clean, had a small balcony at the back which had the sun till late, room was cleaned daily, with fresh towels and beddingStaff at the Anassa are amazingly friendly and helpful and can't do enough for you, even though they are always busy Pool area is lovely with several beds and umbrellas, very quite and relaxedEasy bus access to other resorts, buses every 20 minutes till early morning If returned to Santorini, we would definitely stay at the Anassa and will recommend to family and friends A big thank you to the Anassa for giving us a wonderful holiday   Room Tip: Everybody seemed to be pleased with their room See more room tips",0
"Gorgeous, spacious room which was spotlessly clean and had a lovely big balcony to sit out on. Quiet location and a really comfortable bed for a great night's sleep. A few minute's walk to the beach and restaurants/bars of Kamari and a short bus/taxi ride to Fira.My only negative was one some other reviewers have noted and that is a funny smell from the bathroom - I think perhaps the plumbing needs looking at.The service from everyone was great but George in particular - he was so friendly and lovely and was there for anything you needed.We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Anassa to anyone else wanting to stay on the beach side of Kamari (and thus avoiding the high prices of hotels on the Caldera side!).",0
"Would like to thank all the staff at Anassa hotel for a very nice stay.Manolis, George, Thiologia and Fotini were all very friendly and helpful, not to mention professional. Rooms were kept nice and clean also by pleasant staff.Good location.",0
"This has to be the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in, could not fault it or the staff who were warm and friendly. Great location away the noise of the bikes and buggies buzzing around the town. If we ever return it will staying here, a big thanks to all at The Anassa.   Room Tip: Ask for a second floor apartment as the staff are up early setting the breakfast area up stationed o... See more room tips",0
"I have never left a review on trip advisor before but felt I had to for this beautiful hotel! Myself and my boyfriend have just returned from a ten night stay at the Anassa hotel and couldn't of picked a nicer place to stay. The hotel itself was immaculately clean, modern but still had a Greek feel to the place. Our room was very spacious with a lovely balcony overlooking the pool. It was made up and cleaned every day and always had little finishing touches to the room. Every member of staff were always so helpful and happy to help with anything! Especially George who was always soo lovely and couldn't do enough for you. The food and drinks at the hotel were always really good, especially George's milkshakes and smoothies :)! The location is also perfect, right around the corner from the bus top to get to Fira and Oia and a 2 min walk to Kamari beach and all the restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here when we return to Santorini :)! Thankyou to everyone at Anassa for making our holiday so enjoyable x x",3
"Staying at Anassa Deluxe Suites was quite a nice and pleasant experience, from the politeness and thorough professionalism of the staff, going to great lengths to make sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible. The only drawbacks we can mention was the funny smell of the bathroom (bad pipes maybe?) and the subpar breakfast. We recommend it surely.",0
"We arrived at the Anassa deluxe apartments and were greeted warmly by the receptionist, who explained all about the surrounding area, places to visit and eat and then we were shown to our room, which was delightful, spotlessly clean and spacious. It overlooked the swimming pool. Breakfast was served overlooking their gardens and there was a large variety to choose from and was regularly topped up by the staff. The deckchairs and loungers around the pool are clean and very comfortable and George was the main man, serving drinks and food and generally being there if we needed anything. The staff at the Anassa are extremely friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a lovely stay at their apartments and we certainly did. Thank you.",0
"A very relaxed atmosphere greets you, and you get a sense of being in a secluded resort even if the hotel is located walking distance from the beach boulevard and all the bars and restaurants. The staff is very attentive, and English spoken throughout. The breakfast buffet is one of the most comprehensive and delicious I've ever sampled, with several veggie alternatives. Kids loved the dolphin themed pool, and transfer to and from ferry and airport went flawless. All in all a perfect experience!",0
"My husband and I stayed from 27 June for 10 nights. Literally my only criticism is the ONLY thing that can't be controlled and that was it was quite breezy. The first night we arrived at 10pm after a 2 hour flight delay. The pilot mentioned it was rather breezy and she wasn't wrong. I was worried as I really feel the cold - and had not packed jeans and only 1 jumper... Whilst the breeze remained for the remainder of the holiday, 2 days being very windy, the breeze was welcome and warm as the sun was very hot. We spent most days lazing on the free sun beds on the long beach which was a stone's throw from our hotel. We followed the receptionist's advice on our third day and hiked up the mountain to see the ancient archaeological site. Luckily we were fit enough to do the mountain walk - however please note that the site is apparently closed on Mondays - - so we found once we reached the summit after quite a strenuous climb! We also went on a local bus to Oia to see the sunset which was absolutely stunning - the village is too picturesque for words. It does get very busy with tourists but its beauty is more than worth it. We also went to Fira and walked down the zig zag hill to the waterside which was also stunning - - but the ""donkeys"" are really mules - and big and fit and own the zig zags - you do have to dodge them sometimes and it's rather slippery under foot. There is a cable car as an alternative to go down and back up - - I wouldn't risk passing the donkeys again so we got the cable car back up from where we could truly appreciate the view. Brilliant views of the volcano too. Overall if I could go somewhere tomorrow it would be here. The hotel was the cleanest I've ever seen and had all the facilities you could possibly want including a spa bath in our suite - the breakfasts were delicious, generous and varied and fab, The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and were always around and willing to help. Thank you to them all. Not forgetting the tens of brilliant restaurants with amazing food!   Room Tip: The entire hotel is intimate and fabulous See more room tips",2
Excellent excellent hotel! I have nothing but good things to say. The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location to see Santorini. Kamari beach is beautiful and only a 2-3 min walk away from the hotel. The rest of Santorini can be seen by ATV or car...no need to say in expensive cliffside hotels in Oia or Fira. Staff were so attentive and the breakfast was amazing!!! Special shout out to Manolis who was one of the best concierges ever! He had a recommendation for everything and made sure all details were taken care of. Definitely cared about the hotel and the visitors. Will be back for sure!!!!,0
"My family and I stayed at the Anassa for 4 nights during August, I would highly recommend for anyone to stay here. The rooms are particularly spacious and spotlessly clean. The staff are amazing, really friendly, informative and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble, my sunglasses were even fetched to the airport after I had left them behind.",1
"First I have to rave about the location. This was my first trip to Santorini and I wasn't sure if I should stay on the beach or on the caldera. I made a great choice staying at Kumari Beach. The beach and the shops and restaurants were fantastic. You can not beat the atmosphere.Anassa is in a great location. It's a short 1 1/2 blocks to the beach. There are few hotels closer. The hotel is clean, modern in appearance, and the rooms are large. The bathrooms are large with great showers. Breakfast was fantastic. The pool was just large enough. I really can not complain about one single thing.What makes this a 5 star hotel is the people. Manolis at the front desk was friendly and helpful right from check in. He explained the island to me, helped arrange a rental car that was delivered to the hotel, and was friendly every time I ran into him. George and the rest of the staff as well. I should also mention everyone spoke perfect english. You can not go wrong staying at this hotel. I am planning a return trip to Santorini as soon as possible. I will absolutely stay at Anassa again. Fantastic!!!   Room Tip: I had a second floor room that had a view of the ocean off the balcony. But I am sure any of the 17... See more room tips",0
"I was impressed by a number of things at this hotel: the rooms and their bathroom are very spacious and very well studied to offer comfort and privacy even to a whole family; ours was a triple (which could have comfortably accomodated four) with a curtain to divide it into two different spaces, and the kitchenette was equipped to cook a simple meal in it (very handy for parents travelling with small children). Everything tastefully furnished and clean. Another thing was the excellent acoustic insulation: our night rest was totally udisturbed. The pool area is a beautiful relaxing spot, taken care of very carefully. Breakfast is good, varied and abundant. Excellent value for money. But the thing we must cast the spotlight on is the hospitality of the manageress Fotini, and of her staff. From them we received attentions which went well beyond routine hospitality pracitices, which were true kindnesses, and which in more than one occasion eased our stay and our journey greatly. Highly recommendedHotel! As for Kamari, it is a well served seaside town, with a long beach of black sand, 15 minutes by car or scooter from Thira, the capital, and although ii does not have the charm of Oia or other locations on the caldera cliffs, it is a good place if you intend to explore the island, since it is locatedin the middle of it. The local attraction is the long black beach and the large offer of restaurants, bars and entertainment.",1
"Just stayed at the Anassa and have had an amazing week. The hotel is lovey, small with just around 15 rooms, and new, being built just a few years ago. The lay out is very nice with the rooms coming off of the central pool area. We stayed in one of the standard rooms, but this was very nice with a large comfy bed, a small kitchen area with seating, a modern bathroom and a nice balcony. The staff at the hotel are great and look after everyone very well.Kamari is very nice. It is rather touristy, but all along the front are small restaurants, bars and hotels. In other locations the sea front would be full of a few giant hotels but here all of the establishments are small and family run giving the resort a much more authentic feel. We visited Fira and Oia and while both are lovely they are far less relaxed than Kamari which suited us better. We have a brilliant week and would whole heartedly recommend Kamari and especially Hotel Anassa!",1
"When I arrived at 6:30 am at the hotel, and noticed there was no one at the reception, I was concerned about the stay. But we were received after 15min and they kindly upgraded our room since we were traveling with two small children. It's close to the beach and the room was really comfortable.",1
"The Anassa was a great location. While we looked at staying in Thira or Oia, we ultimately booked in Kamari and so glad we did. Kamari is the sleepy/chill beach town which is great for walking to the beach and dining along the boulevard. Then, just rent a scooter (across the street from the hotel) and adventure around the island. The room was large with all of the basic hotel items. What I really appreciated about Anassa was the staff. Manolis and George were fantastic. They arranged transfers to/from the airport (thanks George!), Manolis arranged for dinner reservations to celebrate a birthday, and generally gave great information. City maps, recommendations of where to eat, and things to do. Also, the breakfast was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel. Really well done. If you visit Santorini....definitely stay in Kamari and stay at Anassa. We will certainly visit again.",1
"We need more places like this. Exactly what should be expected. Quaint, clean, professional staff. The grounds and rooms perfect, modern classical. They staff very accommodating. Room service and Blunch 5 stars . need i say more.. Major chains should take note. We need more boutique hotels like this around the world.",0
"Ok..We decided after reading most of the reviews for Anassa Deluxe Suites to book a week end of June,we thought lets book this hotel in advance and make sure we have a decent room December 30th 2014 we booked.Two weeks before we emailed as advised by recent reviewers,we were told that everything would be Ok..No Worries.Arrive..No George to pick us up..Like a lot of Guest have had.You think then......This is not what most reviewers have had.We wait a little while then call a taxi.We are met by Manola who helps with the luggage.Fortina greets us and George offers us a drink.This for us is the first holiday we have had in 30 years together(without the kids),so it was kind of special.We are then taken to room 205,a dark two single bed room,What a let down.... 6 months of looking forward to this.Poor old George is left to listen to me moan.Fortina has gone..We are woken in morning by a crowd which seemed to be coming from ourtiny balcony when we looked out we were more or less having breakfast we everyone..Lucky I was dressed Ok.So we had no choice of room,Fortina explained we are fully booked,that is all we have.I explained that we booked this 6 months ago and 2 weeks beforeask for a room upstairs.If you read down the reviews 3 couples turned up Grahamjuls/Wonderful.after an error overbooking at another hotel.So we were given no choice,we were offered the rooms of the 3 couplesthat were leaving 2 days later or wait another day for a room with a double bed which we accepted...3 days later we are taken still unpacked to room 211 this was great,our holiday has now began,we were given a bottle of wine as well.We erase the first 3 days and relax.The staff work so hard for you Little Ena in the breakfast room,the maids keep the room spotless and Fortina has all the info.But the real star is George a very nice guy,we enjoyed our stay at Anassa Deluxe Suites,but would not trust going back to stay unless the room was assured beforehand.So if you get the right room..GreatBreakfast...............GreatFortina....................Extremly NiceBeaches..............Not for kids.We had a great time we ate some great meals,see some amazing placesand meet at the hotel such a good bunch of people..All in All..Wonderful.Nearly forgot George...... took us to the airport..If you read this mate.Thank You so much.   Room Tip: We only see two rooms 211 great..205 dingy See more room tips",0
"We are 3 couples travelling throughout Greece, this being our last stay. We only stayed here because of an error in overbooking from another hotel. But the service we received here was excellent - rooms, breakfast, pool, cleanliness, reception, advice, bar service, grand TV in pool area - all great. Thank you for a relaxing end to our 4 weeks in a wonderful country, Greece.",0
"I went to Santorini with my boyfriend in June and overall it was a great holiday and the hotel staff made it even better. The gentleman on the front desk was lovely and very welcoming. He helped us organize a taxi to and from the airport and was helpful and accommodating throughout the whole stay. Upon arrival he greeted us and helped us with our luggage. Check in was very efficient and we were informed of all the local attractions (this was very helpful and aided our holiday plans) and recommended local restaurants which we tried and were very tasty. All the staff greeted us every time they saw us and attended to all our needs. They were all very polite, friendly and hard working.The rooms were cleaned daily, and we got fresh towels everyday. The bathroom and bedroom areas were very clean and we were very happy with the hotel. Rooms were quiet and could not hear any other guests. The communal areas were maintained to a high standard and breakfast was included during the stay. There was a large variety of food available and the time slots were flexible as it was stated 8:00-10:00 but if you were still eating at 10:00, you were not rushed and the overall environment was very relaxed and peaceful.The holiday was one of the best I ever had and the hotel and staff were one of the best I have experienced. It makes a big difference when you are greeted politely and made to feel comfortable and relaxed. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family. The hotel was situated in great location, less than a 5 minute walk to supermarkets, restaurants, public transport, ice cream parlors, the beach (Kamari), desserts and bars. It was very peaceful, quiet and all the people in the local area were very friendly and polite.Thank you for a wonderful stay, it was an amazing holiday!",0
"I wanted to experience Kamari before heading off to the Caldera resorts, and picked Hotel Anassa to stay in for a couple of nights; it did not disappoint. A lovely, quaint and neat hotel, Anassa's advantage is that its in a great location. And guests staying there get to enjoy the excellent service run by the service providers. We had a lovely stay in our Junior Suite, which had 2 bedrooms, a lounge area, a little kitchenette and a clean, neat bathroom. Upon request, the hotel will send someone to pick you up from the airport and we had a pleasant drive with George who met and received us and other guests, and drove us to the hotel. Reception by Fortina was warm and hospitable and the buffet breakfast the next day was pretty decent. The hotel has its own private pool for guests, and free wi-fi as well. Hotel Anassa also is really close to the Kamari black beach if yo fancy a paddle or a swim and they will provide guests with beach towels if they so desire. The hotel is also close to shops, a pharmacy, and the Kamari tours office (if you want to book tours) and it’s a pleasure walking down the aisle of restaurants near the beach. Visitors to Kamari – I will highly recommend this hotel for a nice, quiet and affordable stay.",0
"My husband and I were hotel-hopping in Santorini and wanted a 2 night stay in Kamari before moving to Imerovigli . I am glad to have booked Hotel Anassa; a quaint and neat hotel in a great location and which provided excellent service. We had a lovely stay in our Junior Suite, which had 2 bedrooms, a lounge area, a little kitchenette and a clean, neat bathroom. Upon request, the hotel will send someone to pick you up from the airport and we had a pleasant drive with George who met and received us and other guests, and drove us to the hotel. Reception was warm and hospitable and the buffet breakfast was decent. The hotel has its own private pool for guests, and free wi-fi as well. Hotel Anassa also has the advantage that its close to the Kamari black beach, (just about 1 to 2 minutes walk), its close to shops, a pharmacy, and the Kamari tours office (if you want to book tours) and it’s a pleasure walking down the aisle of restaurants near the beach. Visitors to Kamari – I will highly recommend this hotel for a nice, quiet and affordable stay. You can’t go wrong with Anassa!",0
"We are visiting this hotel each year, and we feel sooo Much at home. Nice staff, wonderful Rooms. We just love it.All Rooms are special, they all have safety boxes, and even bubble bath. The breakfast is home made, delicious.We have been here mand years, and Allahs the hotel looks Nice and clean",0
From 2nd June for 7 days. Great rooms which are cleaned daily. A family run hotel a few minutes walk from numerous restaurants on the sea front. Friendly staff especially Fotini and George made us very welcome and were very helpful with information about the area. A good selection for breakfast. The pool area is quiet and no problems getting a sunbed.The Almira was the best restaurant for us. Straight down from the hotel and left at the bottom and walk to the end of the front. I find it hard to find any negative points about this hotel. One small issue for me is that I prefer beer from a tap and I guess that would go for most UK visitors.The bar currently serves only canned beer. I would however highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to returning in the future.   Room Tip: The rooms are all different but large. See more room tips,0
"This is by far one of the best places I have stayed and I have to say that's purely down to the people who work here. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the most friendly staff. A complementary drink on arrival while you check in, and the lovely George takes your bags to your beautifully presented room. Its clean and modern and we had the sun shining on our balcony. The staff here cant do enough for you. If you want to know any information they go above and beyond to ensure you get the best experience out of your trip here. They helped us with car hire, restaurant reservations, boat trips. We forgot to bring adaptors they gave us one to keep throughout our stay. When you are enjoying the sun on the comfortable sun loungers and don't want to get up and go the bar George will bring drinks to you so you really feel looked after here. Breakfast has a wide variety and is really nice and they don't mind you taking it to your room or anywhere else in the hotel. The hotel is in a great location with the bus stop located just around the corner. We took the bus from here to Fira which is more like a coach than a bus and the hotel checked times for us before we planned our day/night.All round great people and that includes other holiday makers, everyone is happy and relaxed and very polite.",2
"Lovely small hotel with a most courteous and helpful staff ! We stayed for 5 days and staff at reception , breakfast and pool were always attentive and gave fair advice and recommendations to restaurants, which were all excellent.The pool was smaller than expected but OK for kids. A 5 minute walk to Kamari beach and seaside restaurants.. Good atmosphere at doorstep and quiet at the hotel.",1
"Great hotel - would definitely stay again. Modern, comfortable, well-designed and a nice size.Friendly, welcoming staff - always happy to help - e.g. organised airport transfers, car hire, and on our last day (after check out) let us use the pool, shower in the hotel and even helped to dry our swimwear before we left. Welcome and departure drinks were a nice touch too.Location - ideal - under 5 minutes walk from the beach, town centre and bus station. Felt like a nice part of town, particularly compared to the hotels along the beach front (too noisy/less relaxing) or those slightly further out of the town (which didn't have the same atmosphere as being more central).Room - spotlessly clean (as is the whole hotel), very spacious (double-height ceiling), well-equipped, with jacuzzi bath, mini-kitchen and large balcony (some rooms even have two balconies!). Large, comfortable bed.Pool - not huge, but fine for the size of the hotel. There's also a whirlpool and indoors a sauna, steam room and gym. Gym is particularly good for the size of the hotel.Breakfast - very good - nice mix of 'typical' hotel breakfast and Greek food.Bar - great selection, well-priced.As a town, Kamari is an ideal location - good selection of shops and restaurants without being as busy (or expensive) as other places such as Fira and Oia. Large beach, so not too busy. Well connected for driving to other towns (and for Ancient Thira), and neither too quiet nor too loud overall. Pinakio was our favourite restaurant - definitely worth a visit.In short, I'd definitely recommend Anassa, and in fact there were other guests staying who had returned following previous visits.",0
"High standard, calm atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent breakfast. The rooms of all price classes are big and comfotable. Perfect location close to the beach but away from the most trafficated road. After 15 trips to Santorini, we highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",1
"Hotel is very clean with huge rooms. Bathroom even had jetted tub. Location is 2 blocks from Kamari beach were there are tons of restaurants and some shopping. The bus stop is a block away which is what I would recommend for travel to Fira and Oia as taxis were 25-35 euro one way and hard to come by. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The owner was there every day and meet any of our needs. They even ordered us pizza and picked it up for us so we could eat pool side. The bartender George was awesome, ask for the special. We were also driven to the airport free of charge. Great breakfast.",0
"We stayed here in May 2015 for 5 nights and really could not have asked for anything more. The staff were fantastic, the facilities immaculate, the breakfast was great. The hotel is lovely and peaceful, yet so close to the main restaurant areas.",0
"I stayed here for a week with my goddaughter. We arrived early evening & were shown a number of suites for our approval. We had requested a twin-bedded suite but the request had not been forwarded to the hotel. However, whilst out having supper, a separate double bed was made up so that we had a double each in a very roomy suite (211). The room was very large with an excellent bathroom (with a decent hairdryer) & a kitchenette with a fridge & 2 burner hob (we didn't cook here). We also had a large south & east facing balcony with a sun bed, table & chairs & a drying rack with pegs for clothes.The location of the hotel is excellent as it is only one block away from the seafront. We asked for a recommendation for dinner as there are so many restaurants along the seafront in Kamari. A restaurant was recommended for our first evening which was very good & we returned a number of times for lunch & to use their free sun beds & parasols (free sun beds were available from most of the restaurants along the front but this may be seasonal). Other restaurant recommendations were also very good.A couple of days sightseeing were arranged by the hotel, both of them good value & very interesting. One was a 5 hour boat trip on the Thalassa (see separate review) & the second a trip which involved visits to various locations around the island, including an excellent tour of Akrotiri & a visit to Oia in the north west.Breakfast was buffet style in a charming room with seating inside & out. We enjoyed the variety of foods on offer, particularly the greek yoghourt from Crete. We had a light lunch one day (there is a choice of salads & sandwiches).The pool area was edged by very comfortable sun beds & parasols & provided an excellent spot for relaxing when there was too much wind for the beach. We didn't swim in the pool or the sea as the water is too cold at this time of year, though this didn't deter some people.The service in the hotel was friendly & helpful. Fortini & all the staff were lovely & Georges kindly took us to the airport at the end of our stay. The hotel certainly deserves its excellent reviews.It would be lovely to return to Santorini & my first choice of accommodation would be the Anassa suites.   Room Tip: Suite 211 was excellent See more room tips",1
This property could be a Ritz-Carlton property due to its awesome decor and appointments. The service was amazing as was the breakfast. It was a great value for the type of place and service. They helped us get an inexpensive rental car and gave us a great overview of the island. Had a really nice stay there.,1
"Just back from santorini stayed in this hotel from 17th to 24th may for the third time, its a family run hotel fotini and maria are the nicest people you could ever wish to meet.All there staff are so friendly and helpful, a nothings to much trouble for them george is great and makes a mean rum and coke ( not much coke) the rooms are all large and spotless Cant wait to go again",2
"Stayed here for 8 days, room is lovely and modern has everything you need. Staff cannot do enough to help you and make you feel welcome. Really friendly. They have made our stay a very pleasant one and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the place.",1
"The best hotel we have ever stayed in, customer service is second to none closely followed by cleanliness. The rooms are huge with everything you will need for your holiday. The staff will do anything to help you have the perfect holiday, George is a gem he seems to do everything, Flotini runs the hotel like a family home everything is relaxed and so easy going, but nothing is a chore, anything we asked for was either booked or sorted out immediately. Because the hotel has only 17 rooms nothing seems overcrowded and we met some great people whilst there. You are close to great bars and restaurants and easy access to transport links. A must for anyone travelling to Santorini. We will be going back next year for sure.   Room Tip: Pick any room they are all good See more room tips",1
"My name is Manousos, I come from Crete and my family and I have spent the most memorable vacations in Santorini Princess Luxury Spa hotel. The accommodation, the staff and the excellent service in combination with the breathtaking view from our balcony left us a very sweet taste from our holidays. I definately recommend it and I truly like to thank everyone for the great hospitality.",0
"Our stay at his hotel had us all feeling as though we had been crowned royalty overnight. The views are spectacular, the rooms are comfortable the meals are fantastic. The staff have left nothing undone! Try the Greek yogurt with honey and almonds! I can't wait to return.",0
"This is literally the BEST hotel we have ever stayed in Europe, Canada or USA. Everything and anything was done by the hotel staff to ensure that our stay was comfortable. Before booking I had done my research on trip advisor to read the reviews, and the great things about the staff was 100% correct. Since my stomach was upset, the staff was more than happy to prepare food and drinks to make me feel better. My husband and I stayed in room number 25, and we could not believe the view of the room. Drinks and food were served by the pool so you could just relax, enjoy the view and indulge. We regret the fact that we did not stay longer at this hotel, but will be returning in the future for sure. Thank you once again to the entire staff for making this stay unforgettable. We just came back home last night and I am still having Santorini withdrawals!   Room Tip: room 25- private, best view! See more room tips",0
"The staff is amazing. It makes the trip so much easier and accommodating when the staff is soo friendly and helpful. The views are amazing. The hotel has free wifi. They were able to schedule an ATV to be dropped off at the hotel for us so we could explore. The hotel isn't in a major city so you have to drive to get to places for a local dinner. That was the only down side I wish I was a little closer to the action, but with that said it was only 5mins away and the peace and quiet was welcomed! Would stay there again! Great staff, great food, amazing time! Thank you for making our honeymoon a memorable time!",0
"Santorini was the second part of our honeymoon and after all the walking in Rome, all we wanted to do was relax and Santorini Princess Hotel couldn't have been a more perfect place to do so! Since the moment we arrived they treated us like a king and a queen; taking care of our luggage, receiving us with champagne and a delicious dessert, right in time to watch the most breathtaking sunset we have ever seen. The location is perfect: close enough to go to Fira (10 min ride) and Oia (20 min ride), but far enough to have privacy and peace. The service is outstanding. Every employee spoke perfect English and were super kind and helpful.We stayed at the honeymoon suite with the jaccuzi and it was a great choice since we went in April and it was cold at night. If you are planning your honeymoon, pay a little extra for the honeymoon suite, it is worth every penny.I still remember every single moment of our amazing honeymoon and wish I could just live there. This will DEFINITELY be a place we will come back to for a longer period of time!!!",0
"Perfect Hotel. Beautiful views; excellent and welcoming staff - very helpful; private and quiet; excellent location - short drives to Oia, Fira, Kammari, etc. The manager, George, the whole team were super. Our luggage did not arrive and the whole team was very helpful and tried to do everything possible to compensate. Made us feel really special. Hotel itself is one of the best we have been to and would strongly recommend.   Room Tip: all rooms with excellent views. I wouldn't get the room by the pool See more room tips",0
"The best hotel we have ever stayed in! The location is magical, the view is heavenly and the hotel is amazing! But the absolute best thing with this hotel is the service and the staff. They made us feel very special from the time of our arrival until the last day! Thank you Princess hotel for doing an amazing job and for making our honeymoon extra special!",0
"Very boutique feel hotel in a picturesque quiet location. You do need transportation to get to other restaurants. Staff extremely attentive can't do enough for you bringing nice little daiquiris or martinis in the afternoon etc. room was very cool looking with a magnificent view. Would definitely recommend this hotel- the only things I would change if I could would be the introduction of a little bar so that you can have a pre dinner drink and maybe they shouldn't charge for transportation to and from the port/airport, none of the hotels on the other islands we visited did.   Room Tip: Not on the ground floor near the pool as no privacy See more room tips",0
"This was our 2nd visit to the Santorini Princess. The setting is magnificent and the hotel amenities are spot on. What tops this off ?, the staff are absolutely first class. The staff were on hand and offered amazing advice on restaurants and local attractions. The staff have found the perfect balance of being available at all times, friendly and treating you like a truly valued client with out being annoying. The hotel is perfectly situated between Oia and Fira. The hotel shuttle service between these 2 towns operates fantastically. For those that prefer to dine at the hotel, the restaurant is first class and very well priced. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Like us, when you leave you will be planning your return visit asap.   Room Tip: all rooms are excellent See more room tips",0
"My wife and I spent 5 nights here at the end of July 2016. We had arranged for the hotel to collect us from the airport and sure enough the driver was waiting for us on arrival. The drive to the hotel took about 20 minutes but our breath was taken away when we turned off the main road to approach the hotel. The view over the caldera is simply stunning.Check in took less than 5 minutes after which we were given a quick tour of the hotel and then taken to our villa where our luggage was already waiting for us. A welcome drink also swiftly appeared. Our villa (number 20) was clean and spacious and the view from the balcony had to be seen to be believed.The food in the hotel was of exceptional quality. Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Food and drinks in the hotel are reasonably priced for a hotel like this and we felt we received value for money.The hotel run a shuttle service where they take you to your requested destination and then collect you later when you are ready. Unlike some hotels, this does not have a set timetable and they simply take and collect you when you are ready.Without doubt, the greatest attribute of the hotel is the staff. All of those that we met were warm, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The feeling they gave you was that they would do whatever was necessary to ensure you had an enjoyable stay.   Room Tip: Villa 20 with its own balcony offers a fantastic view of the sunsets over Oia. See more room tips",0
"We got married at the Santorini Princess in July 2016 and had the most memorable day thanks to the hotel manager and his fantastic staff. This hotel is 5* service surrounded by breathtaking views, the hospitality and food was spot and the staff couldn't do enough for you. We would 100% recommend staying at the Santorini Princess without hesitation.",0
"This hotel is amazing the rooms are all amazing the staff are by far the best hotel staff I have come across, they all so helpful and so pleasant most of all the manger of the hotel is a Kind gentleman, extremely helpful and very very welcoming. This is by far the best hotel in Santorini the views are amazing and in the best location, so easy to get around everywhere! Without fail I will be back here again for many years to come. Santorini Princess thank you ever so much for the warmest stay.",0
"The location was breath-taking. So high up over looking the water and beautiful sunsets right from our balcony. Travelers walking to Oia had to pass right by as this resort is on a dead end path leading up to the tip of Santorini. Our room was adorably pointed with a canopy beach and marble everywhere. The staff was so warm and welcoming that they felt like family as they really made sure we enjoyed every last detail. Wonderful food, beautiful breakfast and crepes. Well, well worth staying there.   Room Tip: Best Views on the island with all balconies facing the ocean - loved our room near the pool See more room tips",0
"Spent four nights at Santorini Princess in late July, from the pick up from he airport through to the drop off for our flight home I cannot speak highly enough of this property and the very warm, helpful and professional team.The hotel is just north of Imerovigli, about a 20 min walk up the hill into the town but it is a pleasant one, even in the July heat. The hotel offers transfers into Imerovigli for 5 Euros and to Fira and Oia if you need,both reasonably priced. If you want to walk into Fira it's about 50-60 minute at a fair clip, the 'walk' to Oia is really a hike, only 6km but you won't need a stair master for a couple of days - there is little enroute so make sure you have enough water and something to eat as it will take you between 95-120 mins to complete. It is well worth it though as some of the views are spectacular.The rooms are cave style but are spacious, cool and well appointed. The pool is one of the larger ones we saw on the caldera hotels and more than adequate for the 40-50 or so guests the hotel caters for at any one time. We were fortunate to have a pool side room which was terrific.Breakfast was first class with a range of pre prepared buffet style through to an egg, omelette and crepe station. Breakfast goes through till 11 which is handy for the later riser. We ate one night in the restaurant, it was fine but there are plenty of local options which are cheaper and have a broader range on the menu.Staff were great in organising tours and transfers, nothing was ever too much trouble.The benefit of being in a hotel with direct road access was evident during our stay, many of the caldera hotels do not have it so pick ups for tours etc can be tricky, no such problem here. The views are spectacular, particualrly the sunset views. If you are up early the softness in the morning light is quite beautiful.Overall, very little to fault about this place. Well run and you have a team that wants you to relax, if they could get away with taking your phone off you they probably would!   Room Tip: Rooms 12-14 are poolside rooms See more room tips",0
"Stayed here for 5 nights earlier this month, we were beyond happy with our experience. Amazing views from our doorstep, great staff, and great location on the island (the pool and restaurant on site were top notch also). Will definitely return when we travel to Santorini again -George and Amanda",0
"Stayed here for a week at end of July. First off, amazing views from the cliff -- wake up in the morning to a beautiful sunny view of the caldera and at night there's a perfect view of the sunset over Oia. Second, hotel is located in a very quiet area so you get a lot of privacy. We thought the staff was superb -- they don't bother you yet always around to serve. The manager was very attentive and helpful. Hotel is located about 20 mins by car from Oia so it was nice to be able to explore Oia's restaurants and shops in the evenings without being surrounded by thousands of tourists during the day. The rooms are very nice, clean and organized. The pool area is very quiet so we really liked that. Reception staff was very helpful with restaurant reservations, ATV booking, airport transportation, etc. Overall we highly recommend this place and definitely plan to visit again in the future.",0
"We arrived after a 21 hour delay for our two weeks and were greeted by the wonderful team with glasses of bubbly and wonderful baklava. Immediately we felt relaxed and then after seeing our rose petal floored room, we knew this was going to be a wonderful holiday. I don't need to go into small detail as I think from the majority of guests you get the point! This hotel is 5* service in a stunning location but has a calm and simple approach. Attention to detail is the key and with superb staff who actually want to help you have the best stay ever, I cannot recommend the Princess anymore highly. Well done and thank you everyone concerned, and we still have a week left!!!",0
"What a stunning hotel. Attention to detail and staff always around to assist with anything required - even a jug of milk. Rooms very comfortable, Stunning views and sunsets. Beautiful pool area. Breakfasts out of this world. Amazing choices. Staying there for a couple of days with young children I found that the Main menu got a bit boring. Quaint little chapel.   Room Tip: We were situated near the laundry which could be noisy but did not really affect us. Not really suit... See more room tips",0
Wat do I say...words can't describe the elegance serenity of this property..it made me fall in love with my wife once again.they'll practically do anything to make stay like heaven.don't miss this property at any cost.special thanks to george,0
From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing! We were on our honeymoon and spent 10 nights here! The carried our luggage and gave us a tour before showing us our room. Breakfast was fab every morning with breath taking views. The hotel is very clean. The staff are so attentive and friendly! Dimitiri was always on hand and foot to us by the pool! Will def be back :),0
"We chose to stay here with the close proximity to our wedding venue Le Ciel. What can I say, they completely blew us away. From the moment we were picked up at the port with icey cold bottles of water to being greeted by about 8x staff on arrival we knew that the service was going to be amazing! We stayed two night in a superior apartment which was beautiful! We were right on the end so had unlimited views of the caldera and the room was huge. The last 2 night after the wedding we then moved into the honeymoon suite! We actually both preferred the first room as the views were much better but getting ready for a wedding the space was definitely needed in the honeymoon suite. The staff were amazing and the hotel owner/manager was extremely invested in the guests. He would walk around at breakfast and ask us how things were. Really nice touches such as bubbles and a desert on arrival and gifts left on our beds every evening such as mugs, t-shirts ect. On the last day I realised that the dry cleaner still had my travel box for my wedding dress and the staff with an hour until our pick up departure time sent a driver to pick it up...this is the type is service that makes your hotel so amazing. We will be back for a future wedding anniversary and will definitely stay again! Thank you for making our wedding experience that much better!",0
"We stayed here for our sons wedding July 2016! It was ideally placed for the wedding at Le Ciel! Balcony with sea view! Very comfortable and super shower! Buffet breakfast was amazing with great omelettes! Lunches and dinners were also very good! Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff, who were very attentive! Would not hesitate to return! Keep up the good work!   Room Tip: Ground floor rooms better if have difficulty with steps See more room tips",0
"My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Santorini Princess. Nestled in the small village of Imerovigli, we were close enough to enjoy the hustle bustle of Fira and Oia, but had a wonderful, serene, and calm place to return to. The service and hospitality is exceptional. I love the music they play at the pool, it's just the right beat and volume to create a peaceful and relaxing environment. All rooms have beautiful views, but the rooms perched higher have the best views. Request one of those. My only complaint is that it is hard to cool down the apartment for 3 as the AC unit is quite far from the master bedroom, and the person who sleeps in the living quarters suffers due to the blasting AC trying to cool down the back of the room. The breakfast is fine, nothing exceptional, but it's free. Great taxi service is available right at the hotel, and they can easily have a rental car ready for you should you opt for one. Water bottles are available for 50 cents a piece, which is fair. In room coffee is nice, toiletries are good quality, robes and slippers are provided. Definitely go eat at nearby La Maison, it was the best meal we had. The hotel is great in helping make reservations, but give them a day's notice. WARNING: Santorini airport is an absolute disaster, so please do not listen to anyone who tells you that you only need to be there 90 minutes in advance. Give yourself at LEAST 3 hours during peak season.",1
"This place deserves a full 5 stars hands down. When my sister and I arrived, the staff was extremely friendly, introduced themselves and assisted us with check in, taking care of the luggage and sitting us down in the restaurant for Welcome champagne and dessert. 10 minutes in, and I knew I was going to love this place already. They showed us the spa, which has very affordable prices and had we had more time, I would have taken advantage of a massage facial combo. Then led us to our luxury apartment. AMAZING. I died and went to Greek heaven. Beautiful spotless spacious room with enormous bathroom, vanity set, table & chairs and fridge. Now the most amazing part about the room was the view. We had our very own private patio with chairs, an umbrella, and outside cushioned bench. It felt extremely private, and 1st class views. Having booked on hotels.com, I had not expected to get the best room in all of the hotel, but comparing to others I believe we had the best set up.Then we headed off to lounge by the pool, where we decided to go on a private deck with beds & an umbrella overlooking the pool, MARVELOUS. We had superb service from the young gentlemen serving us. The food was great, with options for all price ranges, we tried some greek dishes as well as keeping it simple with club sandwiches and pina coladas. We were truly living the good life for such a great price. Yes, the pool is maybe not the largest pool, but it is beautifully decorated with white stones around, a beautiful view, and lovely assortment of beds and umbrellas in carrying locations to lay out. There was never more then 2 other people in the pool at a time, so truly felt like you had the pool to yourself. It seems this is a place mostly for couples and weddings, and then of course my sister and I. The wifi was strong, and accessible from any location within the hotel.Anyways moving on to the breakfast buffet. WOW. I don't think I have ever had such a buffet as the one they provided. First off, an omelette/egg/crepe station for whatever you would like whipped up. You also get any kind of coffee, late, etc freshly made for your liking. Now the food available was a great variety, all kinds of breads, home made jams & jellies, cheese & meat selection, homemade apple pie pastries, frittata, bacon, sausages, croissants, empanadas, fruit salad, greek yogurt, granola, cereal, fresh squeezed juices. I can't even remember it all, but truly an amazing lay out of a buffet with attentive service.The staff were equally amazing, very friendly and polite. The owner (I can't recall his name as this moment ), but was always walking around to make sure people were happy, offering recommendations and advice. In fact the one night we didn't take his advice we were really kicking ourselves, so the following night we listened to him and had a marvelous experience in the town of Fira. George in the from reception was extremely helpful with winery & dinner recommendations, we ended up at Sphinx in Fira for one of a kind view and dinning. Since there are few taxi's the hotel offers transfer service for a charge, David our driver was always on time, opening the door for us, and very polite.I also really enjoyed this hotel because it was not in the middle of a busy town such as Oia and Fira. Although it was beautiful to visit those towns and explore, I realized I could see into everyones pool or patio. Santorini Princess is not like that at all, you have no other hotels above or below you, just some far off to the side, so truly your experience in private and relaxing.I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, amazing on every single aspect. Thank you so much to the staff for making it a wonderful vacation. I will most certainly be coming back to this hotel on my next trip to Santorini!   Room Tip: best views are the apartments on the second floor See more room tips",1
"The hotel was ok, pretty far from the city center but it did not bother us. Great breakfast and great view from the hotel restaurant. Service ok, they tried a lot and at times even a bit too much, yet still, we did not receive any congrats or even welcome drinks upon arrival even though we had informed the hotel 3 times that this would be our honeymoon. This was a pity in my opinion. Also, we did not get a room with a(ny) view, the room was on floor level next to the drive way. Room was also very dark and moist as well as pretty outdated - not the santorini picture we had hoped for the once in a lifetime trip.",1
"Everyone at the Santorini Princess is so kind, attentive and helpful. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming. They were great with restaurant suggestions and I wish we had asked them for more. The view of the caldera toward Oia is spectacular. A beautiful pool area (so clean!), terrific breakfast, superior restaurant and lovely room with a private balcony. A wonderful stay!   Room Tip: We enjoyed Room 9. See more room tips",0
"The staff was excellent and the owner of the hotel or the manager was always around to ensure the best service. The pina-colada drink was quite ordinary though, don't recommend the cocktails here for the price. Food is average too. Recommend some local restaurants in fira or oia for half the price. They offer airport shuttle at a cost, it is worth taking this as taxis and local buses are unreliable. They do not have a clear sign to the hotel. We had to walk around for half an hour until we found the place after walking into 2 incorrect hotels.",0
"My husband and me choose Santorini Princess as our wedding location. We have been there just 2 days, but our experience there has been exclusive and gorgeous! We've reserved a 3pax room where I prepared for the wedding, and where we both slept the wedding night. Two days before we've met the hotel director, in order to arrange all ceremony and dinner details together. He has been really kind and helpful to us. The wedding terrace is a perfect location for a small ceremony, we had only 10 guests and everything has been awesome. The dinner service has been perfect too, including the food that was really tasty! Morning breakfast includes everything someone could imagine to eat. Fast and easy Check in and check out. Astonishing caldera and sunset view from all rooms and from romantic pool!",0
My husband and I stayed at Santorini Princess for part of our honeymoon. The hotel is beautiful with great food and service. The location between Fira and Oia also makes it a wonderful choice - there's easy access to both while being a bit separated from the crowds. Absolutely gorgeous views of the caldera and sunset. I highly recommend!,0
Absolute Joy to stay in from the moment we arrived - staff very attentive nothing too much trouble and certainly met every request we asked for - breakfast every morning brought to our room - dinner at the hotel is recommended - we had room 4 two bedrooms which for Santorini was quite spacious - we will be back can not recommend it enoughCraig and Gail,0
"Well done to the whole team at SP. From the management to the ground staff the customer service experience was incredible.My wife and I spent four nights at SP and never wanted to leave. It is an amazing location away from tourists crowds where you can watch the captivating sunset. It is close. Hotel shuttles, public buses or quad bikes are available from the doorstep taking you anywhere on the island within 20-30 mintues. I could provide more information about the little quirks that make SP special but I suggest you make a booking and experience it for yourself. Keep up the great work team SP. We hope to return one day.",0
"There isn't a SINGLE bad thing or any possible advice I could give to improve the Santorini Princess. It was the most incredible place we've ever been! My wife and I came here during our two week Greece honeymoon for 4 nights. It was absolutely perfect. Every aspect of our stay was flawless. This resort is a very quite respectful resort. Every guest and worker was very courteous and made it a very calm and serene experience. The staff was there to answer any question at any time. The staff was exceptional. The front desk staff were always wanting to help and make sure everything was perfect. Which it always was! The breakfast staff and pool side service, were always so friendly and made you feel so comfortable. The staff was so helpful in restaurant and sight seeing advice. When we inquired about renting a Quad, they had it ready within 15 minutes. It was hard for us to leave, but it was the most memorable part of our honeymoon. Thank you Santorini Princess!",1
This was an anniversary trip and the staff was incredibly accommodating. I sent several emails prior to our arrival and they took care of everything. The location is absolutely beautiful and perfectly located. It was close enough for a quick van ride provided by the hotel to Oia and Thira for restaurants and shopping but far enough away to enjoy the view in peace. The staff was amazing. Would go back tomorrow!,0
"This is one the most beautiful areas and this hotel has an incredible view. It is located in between the two busiest cities of Fira and Oia. We thought it was perfect. Close enough to the action but far enough away from the crazy cruise ship passengers. Beyond the beauty, the staff was over the top friendly. I'll admit I did tip a number of people and our friends from the UK thought it was not necessary but I'm sure they were genuine. I made a point to let the owner what a lovely staff he had working for him. I would highly recommend and would stay there again if we ever visit again.",1
"The moment we arrived, we were greeted by group of staff who treated us like royalties. This hotel has the most beautiful view of caldera, the rooms were clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to visit again.",0
"Wonderful vacation spent on the Santorini Princess.Lovely hotel, wonderful location, quite, close to interesting villages. The facilities are very well thought. Excellent staff. The food is awesome! Enjoy the marvelous sunset!",0
"The hotel is very well positioned to view the stunning Santorini sunsets. A quiet hotel ideal for couples/ honeymooners... although as a family of four we are thoroughly enjoying our time here. Faultless service with very attentive and friendly staff starting with the Owner/Manager who regularly checks on his guests to make sure they are being looked after. Lovely restaraunt with an excellent breakfast buffet service and lunch/dinner menu. While the location is perfect for quiet relaxation the main town of Fira with its many restaurants, bars, nightlife and shops (including high end fashion and jewellery shops) is just 10 minutes away. Great hotel!",0
"I don`t have words to describe this paradise. You just have to go there and see it with your own eyes! I totally recommend it for couples - the most romantic experience we`ve ever had! :) Amazing hotel - very quite and relaxing atmosphere, excellent service and breathtaking views! We were there at the end of April - the weather was perfect, the staff did everything possible to make our stay exceptional and they succeeded! But the most beautiful thing was the view - simply spectacular!!!   Room Tip: Room number 20 - breathtaking view! :) See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for 3 nights and part of our honeymoon, and all we can say is WOW - The hotel is gorgeous, the staff were excellent and the location (and sunset views) were stunning. Making use of the honeymoon suite, we had a private Jacuzzi which overlooked the caldera and sitting there watching the sun set was just perfect.We found all the staff to be very helpful and can wholly recommend making use of transfer bus; more reasonable than the taxis on the island and no waiting around.We will be back for a second visit at some point!",0
"The service was simply the best, nothing was too much trouble, the staff were so polite and always happy which sets the tone for your entire stay at the Hotel.The sunset from the hotel is pretty special with no need to go to Oia with the cast of thousands to watch it. The hotel very clean and has a great restaurant (breakfast, lunch or dinner).The location was perfect, situated between Fira and Oia you dont feel on top of every other tourist on the island and its only a 10min drive back to Fira and 15 to Oia. You dont need a car although would be handy if you were staying there for anymore than 3 days otherwise using the hotel transport was great and cheaper than normal taxis!!!!Great walking/trekking to Imerovigli and Oia from the hotel. The rooms are spacious and well set out. I would say the only down side is the pool is too warm, almost bath temperature so you cant stay in long on a warm or hot day.",0
"The Santorini Princess Spa Hotel hosted our wedding on 3rd June to perfection. We planned for a relaxed and memorable day for us and our 33 guests and were given, in the words of all our guests, ""the best wedding they have ever been too"". It was truly stunning in every aspect. We were, and have been ever since, been made to feel very special.The management and staff are all delightful, always smiling and chatting to guests without being invasive. When you need them they are there, as if they knew. If you want advice on places to see on the island and how best to get there, from stunning villages to winery's, just ask the hotel management and they will advise you and also tell you how best to get there. A hire car is a must if you are planning on exploring the island, it is quite straightforward to navigate around.We are now enjoying our honeymoon week here and I personally have never felt more relaxed on holiday than I do now. We don't want it to end, however, we will most certainly be returning, especially to room 20 with its large private terrace and stunning views!A huge thank you to all the staff for making this last week so memorable.Mr and Mrs Sheare",0
"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 3 days in May,2016.Great view: great view of sunset and the sea.Good location: not too far from Fira or Oia if you rent a car. Walking is like one and half hour to Oia.Good food: except for the bbq combination, which did not impress us with some big chunk of meat but kind of tasteless.",0
"Located between the two largest towns Fria and Oia and with an amazing cliff side view, SP is excellent hotel and the staff is on point. Exceeds expectations in service and location. Super close to restaurants and beaches. Highly Recommended.",0
"My beautiful wife and I are halfway through a week of luxurious living at the Santorini Princess. My sister got married here yesterday and quite simply it was a fairytale wedding from start to finish.I cannot praise the hotel enough, every aspect is perfection, from the spotless grounds to the exquisite dining.The location is unbeatable with views to die for. The clever design of the hotel ensures every room has stunning views over the Caldera. Simply breathtaking!But I've saved the best aspect till last, the staff and management. I have never felt such genuine warmth and generosity at a hotel before. The attentiveness is just perfect, never overbearing but always on hand should you desire. The manager regularly walks around chatting to the guests making sure everything is okay.I wish I could mention all the staff but the list would be endless. Special mention must go to Nadia, Sofia and Dimitris, whose smile and charm are easily equal to the stunning views.If you want to be guaranteed an unforgettable holiday then look no further, I promise you won't be disappointed. It's heaven.",3
"My wife and I spent 2 nights here earlier this month, 5/8 and 5/9, in room 20. I would highly recommend this room; very spacious with a large private balcony. The balcony had two chairs, a table and loveseat which was the perfect for watching the sunset. Furthermore, the room was on a higher floor so we had complete privacy.The property itself was immaculate; looked brand new. There is also a large heated pool and hot tub which overlooks the caldera which was just perfect. Additionally, on our Greece vacation, the hospitality was truly some of the best we've ever encountered; Santorini Princess was the best of the best in this area. The staff here is outstanding.One suggestion I would make for travelers staying here would be to rent a car. We did and were very glad we made that decision. While we loved the serenity of this hotel, it is a bit isolated. I walked to the center of Imerogolvi one afternoon and it was about a 20-30 minute walk uphill, which isn't bad but probably not what you would want to do before a romantic dinner. The drive however is only five minutes, so a renting a car makes a huge difference. There is plenty of parking here which seemed to be rare in Santorini. Additionally, FYI Oia is about a 15 minute drive, Fira about the same, Aktori was about 30.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. We absolutely loved it. Had an unforgettable experience on this Greece vacation and Santorini was the highlight. Book this hotel and ask for room 20. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!   Room Tip: Book room 20 See more room tips",0
"We spent some days in the wonderful santorini princess spa hotel. The staff was incredibly helpful and so friendly, they made our stay to an awesome experience. George, Chris and Nicole from the reception desk were amazing also the manager from the restaurant and Ethimos from the pool were really nice. The view is breathtaking espacially for the sunset. The food was delicious. I recommend you this hotel for a perfect stay.",0
"We stayed at the Santorini Princess for our first stop in Greece. When we arrived we were amazed at the magnificent views and the awesome hospitality by the staff. They showed us around the hotel before we settled at our room. It was a beautiful room with two queen beds and ensuites. The view from our room matched everything that we had observed about Greece so far - amazing. Breakfast was included in our package and it was a lovely continental buffet breakfast with fresh coffee and an egg station they even had Greek frozen yogurt. Throughout our stay the staff were extremely friendly and greeted us upon our return from our daily adventures. The hotel has its own reasonably priced shuttle to get around the island, but we did a lot of walking to work off the amazing food that we experienced in Santorini. Thanks for the fabulous hospitality guys",0
"From the warm arrival by George, the tour by Nicole and the kir and bakclava delivered to our room we loved the Princess from the beginning. The rooms are a little small but come with a private patio looking out over the caldera with Oia off to the right and Imerovigli off to the left. The breakfast was very good with an excellent wait staff of usually 3 or 4. Looking back on the selection of where to stay on Santorini I'm very happy with the Princess. It's about 1.5km walk up the hill to Imerovigli and is much quieter than both Fira and Oia. Many Fira and Imerovigli properties have walk ways right through the properties and a LOT of stairs up and down. It seemed we had a present from the Princess (hats, t-shirts and necklace) everyday. GREAT PLACE!   Room Tip: We had the last room closest to Oia, great view from the patio. Don't think it matters really. See more room tips",0
"After spending three days at the Presidential Suite (SP) we were a little apprehensive that we would be moving to a hotel, but needless to say SP was amazing! The poolside was lovely, the spa area was relaxing and the views were equally stunning...most of all the staff were extremely helpful! We first booked into a room with stairs which was lovely but my other half kept bumping his head so we requested a room change, which was seamless and problem free. Our room was lovely - Champagne with cake again on arrival really was the icing on the cake,From our stay at the private villa's both myself and my partner suffered sun burn in the worst way possible, the lady in the spa was more than helpful recommending the Aloe massage which within a few hours literally cured me. I also had my nails done whilst staying here.. the same lady was exceptionally talented painting freehand a french manicure with the evil eye on one nail.The food here was lovely and our driver Yiannis was such a great help to us, The great thing about here was that we were able to travel into Fira more frequently and with the suggestion from yiannis for a local place to eat we can happily say Yogi's is the best place for slouvaki! Thanks to each staff member that made this trip as memorable as it was..please have a drink on us for such great hospitality YAMAS!",1
"The apartment was lovely. The food and facilities were great. It's location, perfect - stunning views and easy to get to everywhere - some places on foot, others by car. And the staff were wonderful; friendly, welcoming and so so helpful.Simply Can't fault it.   Room Tip: All rooms seemed to be in a good position - just depends what you want. See more room tips",1
"Gorgeous, squeaky-clean and extremely well-maintained resort with spectacular views and EXCEPTIONAL service! Totally unimpeded views of Oia to the right, Thirassia (where sun sets) right across and the volcanic islets and Imerovigli to the left!!! The BEST views on the entire island!!!Perfection!!!",2
This place is just awesome and I can't rate it it highly enough. I've stayed at places all over the world and not had the same kind of service anywhere else. All the staff are genuine and lovely and can't do enough. The manager walks around the hotel all day making sure everything is okay and he chats to everyone. One morning at breakfast he even tucked my chair in for me upon appearing and offered his recommendation.As for the stunning scenery - wow ! I'm home and I just dream of the next time I can go back to witness the stunning views again,1
"This place for the welcoming at the arrival to the departure was second to none. Initially Sophia gave us a tour of the facility after George brought us from the airport. The manager Alexandros Tsiaras was always available and other persons such as Vaios, Romina and Euxaristo were all very helpful. Sorry if I forget any names. The breakfast was great with excellent omelettes made to order and everyday after clean up they would leave a present for you in you room. Stuff you do not see anywhere. This was a place that I really hated to leave!   Room Tip: Most rooms are great. Of course the ones on the second and third floors have better views. See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Santorini Princess from May 10-16 as it was my best friends wedding at Le Ciel. She also stayed at Santorini Princess along with a few people from the wedding group. From the minute we walked in until the moment we left, we felt like celebrities. I have grown up in the hotel industry (my father was vice president for a world wide hotel chain) and I can without hesitation say this is the BEST hotel I have ever been to. The staff are incredible, friendly, attentive and always there to help you. No matter what you need, they will get it for you. The service, the food, the bartender particularly were incredible too. BEAUTIFUL views, lovely rooms, over all THIS IS A MUST!!!!!!!Thank you everyone for the best stay. We hope to be back soon!Thank you for all of the incredible memories!!!!!!!We stayed in Room 20 (for 3 nights - 1 bedroom) and then Room 22 (for 3 nights - 2 bedroom). Highly recommend both.",1
"We arrived very late at night (1am) from Athens and we were hungry. We called the front desk to see if they had some snacks to sell and the man said no. Instead, he opened the already closed kitchen and prepared us a sandwich with chips and brought it to our room. Thats the kind of service you get here. Smily, happy, helpful people in every corner.Breakfast was very good and the view needs no comments on my behalf, it is just the best. Also the pool is heated during fall month, allowing you to use the pool as much as you want.However, if you are planning to stay in Santorini you should know that Imerovigli is far from both Fira and Oia. You can walk, take the bus or a taxi to get to these places but you will be far from bars, restaurants, etc, especially at night. You should also know that rooms (at least the one we got) are not at the level of the hotel. Our room had only one outlet for us to plug our cellphones, cameras, etc. The lights were not properly working and the tv was hanging in the middle of the room like in a bar. All these things could be easily fixed and we really hope they are because the hotel deserves better.Anyway, we loved it!",2
"Do NOT be put off by the poor reviews of this hotel - take note that they are all quite old. We did not experience any of the bad issues such as mildew, dampness, poor service etc. To the contrary, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty (but in a relaxed and caring way).We cannot praise the staff highly enough - every single one of them was happy, smiling, courteous and professional. They could not do enough to help you but were not OTT or obsequious. They immediately made you feel welcome (kir royale and chocolate cake with strawberries on arrival) and nothing was too much trouble. We have never felt so comfortable and at ease, and yet well looked after. We understand that some of them are on a graduate course which involves spending one year in a hotel. Whoever trains them has got it just right. Their professionalism and attitude was perfect - and they were so happy and friendly. Most hotel staff have always seemed miserable and their smiles rather forced.The hotel only has 19 bedrooms and is laid out in such a lovely way that there are many little seating areas tucked away so that if you don't want to lie by the amazing swimming pool (heated to 26 degrees, and like a warm bath - quite an amazing experience to swim in) you can always find somewhere peaceful to read and sunbathe.We found our bedroom spacious and very comfortable, with a huge walk-in shower. Our terrace/balcony had a glass wall at the front so you felt like you were about to step into the sea below. The views were to die for - amazing sunsets, caldera, Oia, Imerovigli town perched on the top of the cliffs to our left. There was a fridge in our room stocked with water, soft drinks and beer. A kettle was provided, as well as different teas (camomile, green, earl grey, english breakfast) and coffee. We requested some fresh milk and this arrived almost instantaneously so we were able to make a good cup of tea each morning when we woke up and before going for breakfast. One minor criticism - it would have been nice if there was a towell rail in the bathroom in addition to the 2 hooks (which we used to hang the bathrobes on), hence nowhere for the towells. However, as these were changed daily it was not a major problem!The restaurant is on the highest point of the hotel and is glass fronted the whole length so you get the best views. Breakfast is mostly buffet style self-service, but there is a chap who will cook you omelettes, scrambled or fried eggs, crepes to order. So never cold or luke warm!The manager/owner was present every day and would stroll around chatting to guests. Every time he saw us he would come up and say hello and ask if everything was OK. He was always friendly and relaxed and made you feel like you were friends. He was there for our departure to thank us for staying at the Santorini Princess and we made a point of telling him how amazing the hotel and staff are. There is a 'comments' book in reception and I read the comments on several pages - could not find a negative word anywhere so things have changed from 3 years ago.There isn't a lounge area or separate bar and the hotel is outside of Imerovigli so a good 20 minute walk to other restaurants. If you can live with that, then we would definitely recommend it to you - lovely peaceful location, away from the crowds of Thira or Oia.We don't usually stay in 5 star hotels so cannot compare it against others. If this is typical of how a 5 star hotel is, then we shall be staying in more in the future!   Room Tip: Higher up your room - better the view ! See more room tips",0
"Stay here. Hands down. From the moment you arrive, til the second you drive away, this place is phenomenal. The rooms are intimate and beautifully done. The views alone are worth it. Pool is heated. The meals are wonderful. Complimentary breakfast is to die for! Such selection and a custom crepe,pancake or omelette bar!Above everything else is the staff. At the front desk, Romina and George are like family to you and will go above and beyond to help you with anything you need. Everyday for 5 days they personally invested in our day, with either recommendations, advice or conversation.They even sat with us and helped us book a room at a competitors hotel since they were full when the ferries were on strike and we ended up stuck here for two extra days. When housekeeping reset our rooms each day while we were out, they left us small gifts and mementos to take home...each day!!Don't miss out, stay here!!! We are sad to leave!",0
"We were in Santorini to attend a family wedding so we booked a hotel which was close to the venue. What luck that we chose the Princess!From the moment we arrived we had excellent service, delivered in a professional but personal manner, always with the upmost courtesy. This hotel is an absolute gem, their mantra is; 'don't you worry about a thing, we will take care of everything'. And they did, in spades! We were even able to invite the bride and groom to-be for breakfast and they were treated like VIP's, they really enjoyed a relaxing morning which helped to offset the hectic pre-wedding planning.After a week at the Santorini Princess, we were due to go on to Crete via the ferry. However due to the public sector strike which affected the whole of Greece, we had to change our plans. The reception staff obtained flights to Crete, in addition to this they organised our accommodation and helped us to obtain a full refund from the ferry company. All members of staff were absolutely charming, really interested in their guests and ensuring that they had the best experience ever. This small hotel can compete with the very best on every level!Attending our Nephew's wedding was always going to be special but everyone at the Santorini Princess made it so memorable.We thank you all!",0
"Left the cold grey skies of London to arrive in glorious sunshine, picked up by the friendly hotel shuttle bus driver for a very quick transfer to the Princess Spa hotel with spectacular views over the ocean. Started our trip with a fantastic massage & facial in the spa. The staff here couldn't have been more welcoming, friendly and helpful. The location is perfect and from the hotel we walked the stunning coastal walk to Oia. On our second day we hired quad bikes (all organised for us by the hotel) - the perfect way to see more of the island, reaching the south coast in about 30mins. Highly recommend visiting out of peak season, if you can as this tiny island will be rammed in summer but was the perfect place to relax in April. I could not recommend this place highly enough & definitely hope to return again.",0
"Very relaxing,quiet place. Hotel has cozy rooms,outdoor swimming pool with chairs around the pool and also in places if you wish you can have more privacy. Hotel offers very good breakfast from the restaurant with amazing view. You can also use the spa with massages,saunas,manicure and pedicure. Stuff is always around waiting with any help. Very professional.Hope I will be able to be back soon.",0
"My friends & I (six of us all girls) stayed at Santorini Princess Spa for 4 days. From the moment we stepped into this beautiful hotel we were warmly welcomed by the entire staff. We enjoyed the breathtaking view and the lovely weather. The staff was so friendly and helped us with various places we should visit within Santorini. We enjoyed our hike into the village of Thira.. the view was breathtaking and i was able to capture so many lovely photographs and the sunset well i have no words to describe it..... was amazing.Anyone who visits this hotel will always have something good to say about and i will recommend this hotel to anyone who decides to visit Santorini. If ever i get a change to visit Greece again i would definitely be staying at Santorini Princess Spa. Thank you Mr. Vaios, Mr. George, Romina, Nadia, Natasha and the friendly drivers for your warm & friendly hospitality.",1
"Our stay Santorini Princess began with meeting their driver at the port of Thira. We exited the ferry not knowing a familiar face and there was our driver, holding a sign with my name! After a warm greeting we were quickly on our way zig zagging up the side of a very steep cliff on our way to the Santorini Princess. Once we arrived we were welcomed by what seemed to be the entire staff. We were taken on a walking tour of the property that ended at our room. The view from the front door was breathtaking. Situated on the lip of a steep cliff the view over the Aegean Sea completely unobstructed. Sunset was personally calling only to us! After unpacking we received several complimentary glasses of champagne and some sweets (not the chocolate cake that the others have mentioned. This was a Baklava treat.) We were told that all of the items available at the property were prepared from local ingredients. We wanted a Greek experience and the Princess provided just that. After unpacking we welcomed a chilled bottle of Ouzo and several appetizer offerings. We sat comfortably on the balcony area watching the sunset. Afterwards we crawled into a very comfortable bed and experienced the quiet stillness of a Santorini night. It was exquisite! The next morning, feeling well rested, we set out on a 11,000+ step journey into the village of Thira. Along the way we passed through many other resorts. Few had the charm of the Princess. After a full day of shopping and sightseeing we called for the Princess driver who collected us once again. It was time for drinks and more schmeckins! The Saganaki was AMAZING!  The good, the bad and the ugly of our stay at the Santorini Princess: Good: There are so many things to list. Here are just a few; location, the views, authentic “Greek” offerings, room comfort, incredible menu prepared onsite, honey at the breakfast buffet, the driver, laundry service. It was easy to adjust to the new surroundings. It felt like home, familiar and acceptable. All was right in the world.Bad: Breakfast eggs: These were consistently over cooked and lacked the daring possibilities of fresh creative & ingredients. The ingredients that were used were sparse. The chef simply seemed to be afraid to make eggs! On the next morning I ordered “over easy” eggs. 20 min later and after much discussion, I finally received my very well done eggs. Ughhh! Welcome by staff members: Yes, it’s nice to be met by many of the staff members upon arrival BUT the insistence upon leaving our bags was a bit reminiscent of a TSA experience to us road weary travelers. We packed very lightly for our trip having only one 20lb backpack each. Everything we held dear in life was distilled into in those bags; money, cameras, 2 pair of our very best underwear. It was not as if we arrived with steamer trunks and staff. The repeated insistence that we immediately leave them with strangers was…..somehow strange and unfitting in this situation; awkward. The water temperature: On our very first morning we awoke to cold water in the shower. We could only seem to find that one temperature. We wrote it off to a Santorini quirk and proceeded to take very brief cold showers. We told staff members and were simply told to turn the water on and let it run for 5-10 minutes. “It is normal and will eventually get hot”, one staff member assured us. We tried again and nothing. Now after a full day of walking for miles in chilly windy April weather we REALLY wanted nothing more than a hot shower. Ours was cold again. We told the owners and someone was sent to our room to discover we just didn’t know how to operate our own shower properly! There was nothing at all wrong with the hot water. There was plenty of really hot water. So why is this in the bad column? The staff member(s) we described our problem to did not follow up on our situation. I felt a follow up was absolutely required. It was lacking.Ugly: Ferry canceled due to a strike: Before our departure to Santorini from Athens I received an email that stated the Ferry workers were to be on strike (as it turned out the airline workers had also been on strike). The email stated, “You’ll need to discover another means to arrive in Santorini for your stay at the Princess”. Well with no way to get there; by ferry or flying, how on earth was that going to happen? We discussed rowing a small boat for the 250 miles but decided against it. So why am I putting this in the ugly column? Because it was untrue! The strike would not have affected our travel as it was announced that it was to be a 24 hour strike. It was a workers union sympathizing with the plight of others that had agreed to cripple travel in and around Greece for a period of 24 hours. Again, the strike would not have been in effect during the time of our arrival or stay. I woke up early on the day of travel to read this message and became stressed at the possibilities that lie ahead. After several investigations and the decision to simply not give up we went to the port and boarded the ferry like bosses. This message from the Santorini Princess caused us needless stress and to make matters worse the folks at the Santorini Princess never addressed the matter further. No apology for a stress-inducing message. There was no further communication saying for instance, ""No. never mind. You can come now."" I don’t think anyone there stopped to think of the situation from our point of view. It appeared that the Princess was positioning itself for a confrontation from unhappy guests. Again…. no follow up.The bottom line: It’s clear the Santorini Princess has some customer service issues to work on. I'm being brutally honest because I believe that feedback is a gift. This is an honest review of our stay. It is not sugar coated. However, the issues are small in comparison to the overall experience. We LOVE the property and the experience. We would love nothing more than to return again. We whole-heartedly recommend this property to anyone looking for a memorable experience in Santorini. It is a beautiful reflection of the people of Greece and is successfully positioning itself as a world class property. Santorini Princess we love you!",2
"Stayed for a week, lovely hotel. Loved the drink on arrival and rooms are cosy with great views which can be seen throughout the resort. Both towns are a short taxi ride away. Staff are very helpful and food and service in the restaurant was great, will definitely be back!",2
"We were six friends (all girls) travelling and Santorini Princess was the best choice, all three rooms had breathtaking views of the caldera, a porch with a table and overall a sense of wonder. On the pool deck you have a chest with books for the guests to enjoy apart from having THE best view from the pool and the most helpful staff we encountered in all 9 cities we went to. If that wasn't enough the breakfast is very complete, you pretty much have everything and everything's very delicious. The staff was very nice they received us early so we waited by the pool and were given our rooms before the check in time at no extra charge, also we were greeted with a chocolate cake and a glass of champagne. The rooms are like small beach cabanas (all concrete though and very clean) but it has the feel of a house in Oia. We rented a car to reach all the beaches and a short bus ride away is Fira, the capital. I would definitely return to the same place, the view alone is enough but due to the fact that you're high up on a mountain the fact that the pool is heated is a huge plus (especially in April that's still spring).   Room Tip: Best rooms are on the second ""level"" See more room tips",1
"Our honeymoon couldn't have been more perfect. For first time travellers to santorini, this hotel definitely had the wow factor. Each room has a balcony & the sunset from here is probably one of the most beautiful you will see anywhere on the island.. The breakfast was delicious, especially the pancakes, sweet & savoury.. A special mention to the staff, professional & polite at all times, no request was too much..",0
"My wife and I stayed at this place for our honeymoon last June, and I must say that Santorini Princess exceeded well beyond our expectations. The place is situated away from the crowded area of Imerovigli (20 min walk) so you avoid all the crowds walking by the hotels that may cause some distraction for those who seek privacy. We had incredible views of the sunset (just as great as if you were viewing it at Oia). The hotel restaurant was great. After trying other restaurants on the island we realized that the food at the restaurant was that much better. And what can I say about service from the staff. Every other reviews that praised the staff are not exaggerated; they made our stay that much better. They were so attentive, but not to the point where it was intrusive. I mentioned to Georges (the manager I believe) one day that we saw the Santorini Princess on the other side of the island and talked about some other things. The next day, we ran into the owner and he mentioned about me talking about their other establishment with Georges. Those kind of little things impressed me so much about SP and I just can't wait to go back in the very near future. Thank you SP!",1
"We were there last summer for our honeymoon. The staff was extremely helpful, my husband got sick the 2nd night, they offered us a free ride to the hospital and a staff member stayed with us through out the night. The views are amazing!!! The pool was a bit cold but makes up for the amazing views. The rooms were very clean.",1
Friendly international staff which will make your stay the best it can be. We arrived one day earlier than expected and called to see if they had availability; which they did not but they called around a and found us a hotel near and set up the reservation for us. Love the hike to Oia and has some of the best views around.,2
"Just awesome, the photos you see on the website depict exactly what you get. Top shelf staff, as well and a amazing breakfast. We stayed 3 nights and would have loved to stay more. Thanks to al the staff for an amazing stay.",1
"This review is slightly late as so much has been going on, but I felt I HAD to leave my comments on this incredible hotel. Me and my new husband stayed at the Santorini Princess in May after our wedding, and stayed in the Honeymoon suite. The moment we arrived we were both speechless. When you turn into the hotel driveway and see the view, nothing compares. It was outstanding.The staff instantly made us feel very welcome, looking after our luggage and giving us a tour of the hotel and explaining everything we would need to know. We were then showed to our suite, and shortly after were given a glass of bubbly and some chocolate cake (much needed at this point!). The honeymoon suite was ample in size and had a lovely cave like bathroom, it felt very authentic. The balcony and jacuzzi really made the suite for us - we spent most evenings watching the sunset beer in hand soaking up the bubbles. I will never forget it. The food at the hotel was beautiful, incredible choice for breakfast. You could have an omelette cooked right in front of you with anything you desired in it. Lovely fresh pastries too. The Soutzakakia was a favourite of ours, and the club sandwiches were out of this world! It got to the point we wouldn't have to order lunch, two club sandwiches and two coronas would appear next to us by the pool! The service was out of this world, every member of staff was so lovely and attentive, but not so much it was borderline overbearing. One night into our stay and there was a knock on our door, and we were very kindly given two huge cocktails to celebrate our honeymoon. Nothing was too much to ask for. All the little things made us feel so special, and we would 100% go back to stay at the Santorini Princess. The local areas were lovely to wonder around, but we particularly enjoyed Oia - worth a trip too to watch the sunset. One final point- My husband had unfortunately left a jumper at the hotel when we were on our way to the airport. We hadn't realised until it was too late. As we were literally boarding our flight, a stewardess started shouting our surname, and amazingly had my husbands jumper in her hand. I can only imagine it was discovered when our driver got back to the hotel, and he made the journey all the way back to the airport to ensure it got to us. We were gobsmacked. Thank you to the incredible staff for this.Thank you so much to all at the Santorini Princess, you made us feel so welcome and we loved every second of our honeymoon. We hope to see you again soon. The Joyce's xx   Room Tip: All rooms have beautify views - but the honeymoon suite was simply stunning. See more room tips",7
"We went straight to Santorini for the first leg of our honeymoon and could not have been more delighted to discover the Santorini Princess!! The staff, the rooms, the breakfast,the pool, the spa, and the location/location/location - WOW!!! Can't say enough good things - centrally located for the whole island, and a great feeling overall. Very romantic - just perfect! Can't wait to go back for an anniversary :)Kristen and Steve",5
"Stayed here in October for 5 nights. From the moment we checked in to when we left, we were well looked after. Views from the hotel were just stunning and the staff were always at hand to recommend great places to eat and see. The breakfast was always yum with a lot of choice and the staff were always attentive in case you needed anything extra. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone! You can see why they have won so many awards etc!",2
Santorini Princess is the most amazing hotel! I went here with my husband on our honeymoon and it was the perfect spot. The staff was incredibly accommodating. The facilities were perfect. The breakfast was delicious. The room service was amazing- try the greek pizza! The hotel is set just outside of the main area of Imerovigli in the most peaceful area overlooking the caldera. The pictures seriously don't do it justice! The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and they took care of everything including making sure that we were able to schedule any tour that we wanted. I cannot say enough nice things about this amazing place! We will definitely be back!,4
"My husband and I stayed at the Santorini Princess for our honeymoon and we could not have been happier! The hotel is amazing and the restaurant was so good, we kept going back for almost every meal! The staff was incredible and very helpful. They made sure we had everything we needed and more to make our stay as memorable as possible. And memorable it was! Our room was clean and our view was breathtaking. We plan to go back and stay again!",3
"If you want to experience the best Santorini has to offer, this is the hotel to stay! There are no words to describe how beautiful the views are. The staff are really great and helpful. The restaurant serves exceptional food. Champagne cocktails for breakfast is a nice touch. We used the hotel shuttle service and it was reliable and reasonably priced. The pool was nice & warm as we traveled in October. The location is in the middle of the hiking trail between Fira & Oia. During the busy tourist season there might be lot of people who will pass the hotel by, but in October its not a problem.",2
"One of the most stunning hotels I've ever been to! The views are incredible (pics don't do it justice), we got unbelievable views of the sunset from our balcony but you can also see it from the pool and restaurant!The staff are extremely friendly and professional and really go above and beyond to help and make you feel at home! They all speak perfect English too! The hotel also runs a very affordable shuttle minibus service to anywhere on the island day and night, which is VERY useful as taxis are limited on the island!It must also be said that this hotel is kept extremely clean and everything is the highest standard! I'm an OCD clean freak and I can honestly say I didn't see a speck of dirt anywhere!!There are a couple of minor downsides, but please don't let this out you off going!!....they are:Firstly the pool area is small so sunbeds are limited, if you are going in a group of more then 2 it might not be possible to sit together! (We were a group of 4) but you can always get the minibus to the beach instead!Secondly the food is very good for breakfast and lunch but not top restaurant quality for dinner! There are AMAZING restaurants in Oia, Fira & Im",1
We stayed here for 3 nights and we were regretting about the short stay..!! It should have been a longer stay..!!Hotel staff is so so so helpful and warm. We were greeted with such a huge smile and our luggage was picked directly from our car to the room. They have a gorgeous pool which was heated since we went in October. We loved the cocktails by the poolside.Only one suggestion I would like to make is the breakfast choices. Very limited choicea they have. But I loved complimentary champagne in the breakfast :-)Overall a great stay..!,1
his hotel was like staying in a postcard. It was luxurious at the max! such an amazing hotel and amazing views from your hotel room. Even lying down in bed you could see the incredible views that were to die for. The staff was incredible as well always helping out with whatever we needed always answering questions and making sure we were well taken care of this was such an amazing experience and due in large part to the this hotel. TOTALLY worth the price! The only complaint was the wifi and that balcony's could be seen from anyone on the main hiking trail so they werent completely private or quiet.,0
"The Santorini Princess Hotel and Spa was the most romantic setting for our honeymoon we could imagine. The staff welcomed us with champagne and cake as we were enjoying our first sunset. Words truly cannot describe the beauty of the Caldera. Perched high on a cliff the hotel is impeccably clean. The staff and owners are the most accommodating and friendly we have seen in all our travels. They arranged for a car to be brought to us for a one day drive exploring the island. Another day they arranged a boat tour for us. The town of Imerovigli is higher on the hill and you can walk to it for a variety of restaurants and views of the port where cruise ships dock. The opposite direction from the hotel is the town of Oia, which is absolutely charming with shops, restaurants and more incredible views. There are walking paths up to two churches and although we are a couple in our sixties, we could navigate the hills well. Truly, we cannot imagine a better place to enjoy our first trip to Santorini.",1
"Our honeymoon took us to this slice of heaven for 8 nights, I can't begin to express our overall satisfaction with our choice. A tripadvisor score of excellent doesn't capture our sentiments enough!From the east cost of Canada, we know how to be hospitable, friendly, gracious, humble and thankful... ALL the staff at the Santorini Princess are welcomed Maritimers anytime. Right from the start, the extremely warm welcome, to our departing sorrows by both us and our driver... we had an impeccable stay, and experience. One I doubt we will ever be able to match, but will strive to achieve.Lazing by the pool reading books, capturing mental photos of the greatness of the vast views, and trying to comprehend the beauty, and value of the peaceful sunsets, enjoying the honeymoon suite and spa. Feasting on the great breakfast, and Greek Pizza!!!! All the staff, every single one of them, were great! Highlighted by the dependable shuttle service with David behind the wheel, and the endless attentiveness and pleasurable encounters of warm welcomes and personal recommendations... my hat goes off to Dimitris!!! If there is availability showing at this hotel during your travel plans.... stop reading this post and book the Santorini Princess before its too late!This accommodation is close to Fira, & Oia, but secluded just enough. (I hope you booked it already, I told you to stop reading and book it already!!!)   Room Tip: Honeymoon Suite hot tub temp can be adjusted upon request. All three rooms we were in were a dream. See more room tips",5
My wife and I stayed here for only one night as we had a previous booking upon recommendation from a friend and decided to come a night earlier. Costa Marina had great reviews and we thought we would try it out. The hotel is beautifully located and in the central town of Fira. The rooms are pretty and clean with a very nice balcony for enjoying the sweet Santorini air. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful in making new recommendations on what to do. The hotel is very affordable. It is not located right on the cliffs but is in a good location to walk anywhere if you want to save some money and spend more on meals/excursions. I would definitely come back here again!,0
"Highly recommend this place !. Thanks to Marina ( and Lela) for their great hospitality. They took such great care of us. They are so knowledgeable about the area making great recommendations for eating, sight seeing, and shopping. Very close to all the amenities. Our particular room was a little small, with not a lot of room for our clothes and luggage, but it was clean and well taken care of.We would happily recommend this place !",0
"We are a family of 5 who stayed in Costa Marina Villas in July in a single + a quad room. The quad room has a cute attic with low curved roof (a little tight to climb if you are broad). Air conditioning is powerful in both rooms, a little reaches the attic which is fine with me as it is not too hot at night. Wifi is strong in almost every part of the building. The location is central and close to restaurants, shops and bus stop. Breakfast is good but we had it for a day only because we wanted to try other food.The BEST part of our stay was enjoying the excellent service provided by Marina and her colleague. Both had extreme energy and stamina and are enthusiastic and passionate about what they are doing. Fast response to emails, thorough explanations and patient replies to our endless questions (despite repeating these countless times to all guests), arranging for transfers and car hire etc. Always with their lovely smiles and friendly disposition.I have never encountered a host as hospitable as her and service continues even after we have checked out of our rooms. We were taking a ferry at 5 pm and waited in the lobby(after checking out) and she even offered to get us ice to go with our drinks. Incredible hospitality as officially we have checked out already and she had other things to do! She walked us out to the transfer car so it's service all the way. Santorini is blessed to have people like Marina who leaves great lasting impressions on tourists like us. We had a slight issue of over charging by the port transfer driver (nothing major, likely a miscommunication) and Marina immediately sent a refund through to our credit card (without me asking).What more can I say except ""Marina Costa Villas have surpassed 5 stars service & offers great value at the price charged! "". Glad to have stayed there.   Room Tip: Some rooms have balconies. I booked late so all were taken. See more room tips",0
"Marina and Laila you girls are excellent hosts. nice location...fast wifi..cleanest rooms..nice breakfast...cosy balconies to see sunrise..you just feel like home..Marina takes personal interest in planning your trip and guides you appropriately. bus stop walking distance,fira town close by..such a nice property to stay in ..wish we could stay more.",0
"Fantastic clean hotel with great rooms, and a superb location a block away from the heart of Fira. Marina is extremely helpful and can help set up your whole experience in Santorini. Breakfast is available as well as free wifi. Great value for Santorini!",0
"Spent a week there with family, simply decorated rooms but very clean. Both Marina and Maria, make you feel right at home. Close to Fira town centre. Breakfast is simple but very tasty and filling, loved the Greek yogurt. Totally recommend if you want a quiet place to stay either for a long stay or short.",0
"I have stayed there in both 2015 & 2016. Spectacularly located within 1 block of Fira, it is a villa styled somewhat in the Spanish motif, super clean, lovely florals, lush vegetation, and excellent amenities. All of these qualities are superseded by the affable, extremely helpful and personable Marina (and Lela too, I might add) who has a great knowledge of the island and where to go for everything. She booked our shuttles and our ATV’s for us, and last year, even went to the police station to pick up a report I required after I had already left, and couriered it to me in Athens. Who does that? Did I mention that it is reasonably priced? Highly recommend this accommodation.",0
"Marina and Lela are two young best friends that run this hotel. They made our stay so memorable and it was lovely!! The hotel is clean, a good value, and close to the caldera. If you are looking for one of the hotels right on the water overlooking the cliffs with a pool, don't stay here, but if you are looking for a boutique budget friendly hotel close to Fira, this is your spot.The first day Lela worked with us to figure out how to fit in all of the things that we wanted to do in Santorini and gave us some great restaurant suggestions! They were also very helpful when we wanted to go places that needed reservations- they would call around for us and find a good spot! They were so warm and friendly and made our stay memorable. We will be back!",0
"Adorable place! We were only there for one evening and the host was amazing! She organized dinner reservations and taxi services for us! It's a very quiet, tranquil space. It has the most beautiful infinity pool and the pool is adorable! Highly recommend !",0
"It really can be the staff who make or break a hotel for you. The 2 ladies operating at reception on both days were bright, energetic and delightful. We only stayed one night but would heartily recommend this place for a few days. Central, clean and happy!",0
"I cannot recommend Costa Marina Villas enough to you. Marina checked us in with warmth and sincerity, lead us to our room, fed us a beautiful and large breakfast, and gave us a detailed map of everything in Fira and on the Island. The room was spacious enough with two-chairs and a little patio in front of our room (where we dried out our bathing suits overnight). The air conditioning worked well and the shower was fantastic. Everything in Fira was in walking distance and we enjoyed her restaurant recommendations. The bus to everything on the island was a ten minute walk away from our room and suited us just fine. Since we had an evening flight off Santorini, we checked out in the morning and left our bags with her in the office. They didn't charge us for this service and even offered us a free shower facility at the hotel before we left on our flight! I highly recommend the Costa Marina Villas. Thank you so much!",0
"This hotel was beautiful & I had a great stay here. We had a triple room & it was loft style, where two single beds were up on the loft and one was on the main floor. It was different and interesting, Marina explained that this is the traditional style in Santorini. Then we arrived Marina was very nice, showed us all the things to do and created sort of an itinerary for us. She recommended great restaurants and a winery. We followed her advice and directions and ended up having a great time in Santorini. We had questions just about every day- Marina & Lila at reception were so great with helping us and giving us advice. Both of them were so sweet! You can tell they genuinely want you to have a good time and to enjoy your trip. The hotel grounds are beautiful, very clean, and in a great location. The caldera & beautiful views are a short walk away. I would highly recommend this hotel, it made my stay in Santorini one to remember :)",0
"This is my first time to common in tripadviser, just for Costa Marina!I stay for three nights and my receptionist is Lila.Lila is Marina's friend, she is very passion and shows evey possible consideration. Of coures, she is very beautiful!The villa is clean and beautiful. You can see the sunrise and sea view, the room design in tranditional Santo style but evey electronic equipments are new. Althought near the main bus staition, walking 5-10 minutes can get every bus in Santorini.If you want to stay in Fira , I recommend here extremly.You will get a perfect vacation in Santorini.<U+6975><U+529B><U+63A8><U+85A6>Costa Marina Villa <U+9019><U+662F><U+6211><U+7B2C><U+4E00><U+6B21><U+5728>tripadviser<U+767C><U+8868><U+8A55><U+8AD6>,<U+5C31><U+70BA><U+4E86><U+5979><U+5011>!<U+6211><U+7E3D><U+5171><U+5728><U+9019><U+88E1><U+5F85><U+4E09><U+500B><U+665A><U+4E0A>,<U+63A5><U+5F85><U+6211><U+7684><U+662F>Villa<U+4E3B><U+4EBA>Marina<U+7684><U+670B><U+53CB>Lila,<U+5979><U+975E><U+5E38><U+8A73><U+7D30><U+5E36><U+6211><U+8A8D><U+8B58>villa<U+8A2D><U+65BD>,<U+4E26><U+4E14><U+4F9D><U+64DA><U+6211><U+5F85><U+7684><U+5929><U+6578><U+53CA><U+4EA4><U+901A><U+5DE5><U+5177>(Bus)<U+7D66><U+4E88><U+884C><U+7A0B><U+5EFA><U+8B70>,<U+6211><U+4F4F><U+7684><U+623F><U+9593><U+9762><U+6771><U+5411>,<U+53EF><U+4EE5><U+6709><U+975E><U+5E38><U+68D2><U+7684><U+65E5><U+51FA><U+3001><U+6708><U+4EAE><U+53CA><U+6D77><U+666F><U+53EF><U+770B>,<U+623F><U+9593><U+5145><U+6EFF><U+7528><U+5FC3>(<U+5BA2><U+623F><U+6E05><U+6F54><U+5B8C><U+7562><U+84EE><U+84EC><U+982D><U+7D55><U+5C0D><U+9762><U+5411><U+7246><U+58C1>,<U+4E0D><U+6703><U+4E00><U+958B><U+5C31><U+5411><U+5916><U+5674><U+6FFA>;<U+6D74><U+5BA4><U+53CA><U+623F><U+5167><U+8A2D><U+8A08><U+5145><U+6EFF><U+50B3><U+7D71><U+8056><U+6258><U+91CC><U+5C3C><U+98A8><U+683C>,<U+5E8A><U+975E><U+5E38><U+5927>,<U+6240><U+6709><U+96FB><U+5668><U+7528><U+54C1><U+5747><U+4E7E><U+6DE8><U+4E14><U+65B0><U+7A4E><U+7B49>…),<U+512A><U+9EDE><U+592A><U+591A><U+65CF><U+7E41><U+4E0D><U+53CA><U+5099><U+8F09><U+3002><U+7576><U+7136>,<U+552F><U+4E00><U+7684><U+7F3A><U+9EDE><U+662F><U+4E0D><U+50CF><U+5176><U+4ED6><U+6C11><U+5BBF><U+81E8><U+5927><U+8857>,<U+8DDD><U+96E2>Fira<U+516C><U+8ECA><U+7E3D><U+7AD9><U+5927><U+7D04>5-10<U+5206><U+9418><U+8DEF><U+7A0B>,<U+56E0><U+8056><U+6258><U+91CC><U+5C3C><U+672C><U+8EAB><U+8DEF><U+9762><U+5C31><U+6709><U+4E9B><U+4E0D><U+5E73>,<U+7121><U+884C><U+674E><U+6642>ok,<U+62D6><U+884C><U+674E><U+9700><U+8981><U+4E00><U+9EDE><U+8010><U+5FC3>,<U+4F46><U+4E5F><U+56E0><U+6B64><U+975E><U+5E38><U+5BE7><U+975C>,<U+4E0D><U+50CF><U+5927><U+8857><U+4E0A><U+5435><U+96DC>,<U+53E6><U+56E0><U+9130><U+8FD1><U+516C><U+8ECA><U+7E3D><U+7AD9>,<U+5230><U+8056><U+6258><U+91CC><U+5C3C><U+4EFB><U+4F55><U+666F><U+9EDE><U+90FD><U+8D85><U+65B9><U+4FBF>,<U+5FC3><U+8840><U+4F86><U+6F6E><U+60F3><U+53BB>Oia<U+770B><U+591C><U+666F>,<U+8D70><U+51FA><U+53BB><U+5C31><U+6709><U+642D><U+516C><U+8ECA><U+642D><U+4E86><U+3002><U+7E3D><U+9AD4><U+4F86><U+8AAA><U+662F><U+975E><U+5E38><U+68D2><U+7684><U+4F4F><U+5BBF><U+7D93><U+9A57>,<U+6975><U+529B><U+63A8><U+85A6><U+8981><U+5728>Fira<U+4F4F><U+5BBF><U+7684><U+4EBA><U+9078><U+64C7><U+9019><U+88E1>,<U+4F60><U+6703><U+5F97><U+5230><U+975E><U+5E38><U+8CBC><U+5FC3><U+3001><U+71B1><U+60C5><U+7684><U+62DB><U+5F85><U+3001><U+8A73><U+7D30><U+7684><U+5C0E><U+89BD><U+4ECB><U+7D39><U+53CA><U+5B8C><U+7F8E><U+7684><U+5047><U+671F><U+3002",0
"Our family of 4 (parents + 2 college-aged daughters) stayed at Costa Marina for 3 days, in two rooms, in mid-late May 2016. It was my favorite hotel/ guesthouse in our two-week trip to Italy and Greece! It was well located - convenient yet quiet - very attractive (lovely flowers and layout), and the rooms were well appointed, comfortable, and spacious, yet cozy and welcoming. And, Marina and Lila were the best hosts one could hope to have! They gave us great advice on where to go and how to get there, and were incredibly cheerful and energetic in all that they did. If we manage to get back to Santorini again we will definitely head back to Costa Marina!",0
The hotel was beautiful and the host--Lila--made our stay a truly unforgettable experience. She radiated warmth and joy from the very beginning and was so helpful in planning our days. We definitely recommend staying at Costa Marinas Villas to anyone who plans to visit Santorini! - Lindsay and Alyssa N.,1
"This is a great hotel, clean with a good sized bedroom and a very generous continental breakfast. It's near to town - five minutes' walk from the centre of Fira - with a nice view over the other side of the island. But what really makes it stand out are the staff - they could not have been more helpful. They made arrangements for us and gave us tips that meant we really made the most of our time on the island. A great, reasonably priced option for Santorini.",2
"I stayed at Costa Marina on a quick 2 day trip to santorini and the staff made me wish I had stayed longer! They are so welcoming and kind (even when I arrived at 1 am) and they go above and beyond to ensure that you enjoy santorini to the fullest. They gave great recommendations on things to do and restaurants that were always spot on.The property is immaculately clean and very central in Fira, but it is located on a side street so it's away from the noise of the main drag. I honestly wished I could stay longer and this will be my go to accommodation the next time I am in santorini - there will be a next time!",2
Really enjoyed the stay! The staff are helpful and go their way to provide service and information. I would recommend friends and colleagues to stay at this hotel. Just wonderful experience. The location is also good and convenient.,0
"We had a wonderful stay. Marina was so helpful, considerate and very knowledgeable about how to take advantage of the island. It was a beautiful villa and breakfasts fantastic. I will not hesitate to stay here again if I visit the island again. Thanks Marina!",0
A beautiful villa - hotel with a unique architecture. An excellent staff ready to serve you all day long giving you the feeling of being home. The shower is built with stones and gives you the sense of having a bath in a cave. In the Fira town only 5 minutes from Caldera.,0
"Our stay was absolutely fantastic. Staff was super friendly even though we arrived quite late at night and had to wake someone up to open us the door. Breakfast was delicious, I especially enjoyed having yogurt with nuts and honey in the mornings. Location was only a walk distance from the heart of Santorini.",0
"I admit it, I can be a hotel snob and appreciate good service. Good hoteliers know the value of providing guests with great service and the service at Costa Marina Villas surpasses every other place I've stayed. First, this boutique hotel is darling. Well decorated and the grounds are lovely. We had two rooms, one with a outside entrance with a small lanai, and the other upstairs with a balcony. Both were comfortable. The location is perfect for those who want to be in the middle of the city action. No cabs needed, you can easily walk to shopping, restaurants and sight seeing. Marina was a gem at helping to plan excursions and as a native of Santorini, knows the best places to visit or hike. Buy the breakfast! You'll be delighted with the food. If you need advice or help booking tours, ask Marina. She's an excellent solutions finder. She and her staff provide the finest service I've experienced on all seven continents. Highly recommend.",0
"Costa Marina was in an excellent location, a few minutes walk from the center of town and the bus stop, on a quiet street. The room was clean, bright and very comfortable. Breakfast each morning was more food then we could even possibly try to eat. Even if this wasn't the case, I would still come back here again and again because of the hotel's proprietress, Marina and her friend Lila. Marina was absolutely amazing! We felt like we were staying with an old friend who knew every nook and cranny of the island and was overeager to offer advice and provide helpful tips from a local. My friend and I ended up ditching most of our original plan and followed instead recommendations from Marina and Lila, which we are convinced made the trip better then it would have been otherwise. She even got us a better price on everything then we found online! Friendly and warm, they went above and beyond and created wonderful memories for my travel mate and I. I would recommend a stay at Costa Marina to anyone who visits Santorini and if you do please send Marina a big hug from me!",0
We felt at home the moment we entered this place and Marina added that special welcome to make you feel instantly at home. She and her support staff is simply amazing. The guests are treated as family and not mere passers by! The place is so well located so we seniors had no problem about moving around. We have stayed across the globe on travel but Costa Marina is one of the very few places where we felt at ease. I have already recommended this lovely place to our friends and relatives   Room Tip: All rooms are good See more room tips,0
"Marina and Lila make us feel at home and showed up in two minute anytime when we need her help by dialing ""0"" in our room. Great location; just a short walk from central Fira, but far enough away to be quiet. Beautiful spacious and clean room with amazing staff. Highly recommended!!! Katerina - Panos",0
"Clean room, delicious breakfast, great location, helpful staff- this hotel has got it all and more! From the time we checked in(we were welcomed with some sweet wine), till it was time for us to leave, Marina and Lila made sure our stay here was comfortable and helped us plan the various tours.Our room, including the bathroom, was clean. It had a rocking chair and a cute balcony. On the outside of the villas, there are so many beautiful and colorful flowers. The reception has little wicker baskets with shells and lava stones. Loved the decor. In the morning Marina made us little sandwiches for breakfast. There were croissants, cake and fresh orange juice. The best part was the yogurt with fruits, honey and nuts! The jams are delicious too! Great breakfast overall!The location of the hotel is great! The main square at Fira is a 5 minute walk. It is filled with shops and restaurants. Marina and Lila are the best! They helped us plan our tours. The day tour of Santorini they recommended was enjoyable. The boat tour to the volcano was great. They even made sure that we wore our shoes for the volcano tour as we had to walk quite a bit and climb uphill. They handed out umbrellas when it rained and even offered me a jacket when it was windy. Every time we passed by the reception we were greeted by smiles and pleasant conversations. The day we left, they even packed little breakfast bags for us!Do not miss an opportunity to stay here!",1
"Stayed at Costa Marina for 3 days, location is excellent, enjoyed the home prepared breakfast but most all is the excellent service that Marina and Lila provided. We really enjoyed the volcano tour that Marina recommended. Lila recommended the restaurant the family runs and had a great meal. From NathanVioletAshley- You are the best!",0
"The hotel is just a few-minute walk from/to the bus/taxi station and there are many restaurants and shops within the region. The hosts are the nicest people ever, who are friendly and helpful. The price of the hotel is very reasonable for the high-quality rooms and the homemade breakfast is delicious and cheap. Definitely will book this hotel again for our next visit in Santorini!",0
"I stayed their for 2 nights and 3 days it was a pleasant stay, located at the center of the city, the hotel offers all sort of amenities for the guests. Maria the host and owner was very cordial and welcomed all sorts of requirement and she is a hands on and hospitable person . I would recommend this hotel highly.",2
"My 11 year old son and I stayed at Costa Marina for 3 days. Marina, the host, was very helpful and friendly. Their family also runs a nearby restaurant where we got 10% discount - excellent place for vegetarians. Marin helped co-ordinate our various activities. On the second day - some guests staying upstairs created a rucus all night. She made up for it by giving us breakfast in bed on the house the next day!!! This place is not next to the caldera, but you will wake up to a magical sunrise. Its walking distance to the center of Fira. Great place to stay.ParaKallo Marina!",0
"This place is great. We only stayed 1 night but I wish I was there longer & plan to return soon.Marina was amazing. She was extremely helpful and made us feel at home the in the span of 24 hours. It was a little hard to find the first time, but once we did find it we were very happy with our choice.",0
"Had stayed here last May, it was a wonderful experience. The beautiful flowers all around the property..the excellent huge bathrooms n super helpful n friendly staff. The yogurt with fresh fruits served in breakfast was super yummy. Location is fantastic as it is a 2 min walk from the fera market n bus stop. Highly recommend this place.",0
I was at the hotel last July with my husband for our honeymoon. It is not a fancy hotel. But it is very clean and the staff is very nice. They even helped me to mail out my postcard. Make sure to get the balcony suite. It was so comfy to sit at the balcony. It was 7 minutes walk to the fira town. My husband is very picky. He liked the hotel a lot. Highly recommended!,0
"Cosy and well appointed rooms. Friendly people attending at the reception and also at the diner. They are always ready to help be it travel advise, shopping or any other problems. The location is also really central at Fira and close to the bus station and shopping dining areas.",1
"Easily the best place we stayed in Greece in our 2 week trip. Marina, our host was very friendly and helpful. She helped us plan our stay in the island including booking the volcano boat ride and plotting the Oia hike for us. The € 5 breakfast was also really good. Rooms were spacious and clean. were also allowed ro use the room past our check out time since we had a late flight out of Santorini. All in all it was perfect.",0
This is a very nice property situated very close to the centre of Fira and bus station. Marina and the others here are extremely helpful and go out of the way to make your stay comfortable. Rooms are comfy with a nice view.,0
This is just a block down from the bus station and if you dont want to dragged your luggage in a stoney area then this is the perfect place for you. Maria is very helpful when it comes to getting around the place. She told me that there's no time difference whether riding in a taxi or a bus from getting to an area to another which I find it very useful for my packet.,0
Marina was an amazing experience for me an my friend. We were back packing around Europe and we found this place online and we definitely loved it. I mean it's not fancy or anything but it's clean and is very comfortable. Big rooms which is really nice. Marina at the front was so nice to us she helped us get around santorini and gave us a good deal for staying and extra day! Definitely recommend it to anyone.,0
"We arrived early in the day and were allowed to leave our luggage at reception. They were kind enough to let us do the same on our last day after we checked out, but before we had to be to the airport. The lady at the front desk was very helpful, friendly and warm. She provided us with a detailed bus schedule, advice on other spots to visit, and any questions we had. The service was impeccable and the room was spacious & very clean (and I am picky!). I loved the rock touches (rock toilet paper holder, rock soap dish in shower). Our room had a nice view of the ocean, a sitting area outside, and a mini-fridge (woohoo!). The hotel is a short walk from the main square of Fira and the bus station. It is also in a quiet and very safe area. The hotel provided a nice large bottle of water each day, which was very helpful. We would definitely return to Costa Marina Villas if we found ourselves back in Santorini.General info:Fira is the main town in Santorini and located in the middle of the island. It's only about 30 minutes drive to either the north or south end of the island. We used the buses exclusively and found them to be quite good. The bus from the airport, though, only runs once an hour. We got really lucky and hit it just right. Santorini is a great place for souvenir shopping. Most shops accept credit cards (we did not find this to be true elsewhere in Greece), and there is a lot of variety/selection. If you are going elsewhere in Greece, you may want to do a lot of your shopping here.   Room Tip: I'm guessing there aren't any bad rooms. See more room tips",1
"Marina is absolutely brilliant, she runs the full place by herself and she's always on call whatever time you need her! She made us feel really welcome and provided us with a lot of information about the island and places to visit whilst we were there.",0
"This place was amazing .The customer service Marina gave us was so warm we felt right at home in her presence . We booked 3 double rooms and were pleasantly surprised at the size of the rooms and views from the rooms .This hotel is 5 min walk from the main shopping area,restaurant and city center. Car and bike rental shops are next door and Marina negotiated a good price for our car rental from these guys . There is also a laundromat just around the corner and this hotel also offers amazing sunrise views from room and common areas . Garden area has some amazing spots to get beautiful pics.Marina guided us to the main and must see spots in and around the town, good places to eat food , nightlife and shopping. Made our vacation more memorable and pleasant with all her warmth. Thank you so much.",0
"We booked directly and asked Marina to keep for us a nice double bed room on upper floor with balcony. We had a very nice room according to our wishes and great view of sea and sunrice from our balcony as well.Marina is a great host. healps planning tours, solves any problems. It is the only place I know that when you book a car, the delivery and drop off is in your hotel free of charge. Breakfast is very good. I would not call it continental. it is much more.",0
"This lovely hotel is about as good as it gets in Santorini which has many nice hotels. The structure and interior decor are beautiful and in perfect order, and the owners are most accommodating and anxious to be certain you are pleased. Breakfast is special and is individually prepared. It is about two blocks to the cafes and shops and three to the high road overlooking the caldera, which cannot be seen from the hotel. The price would be three times more if it could be. As there is a continuous incline to the top, this hotel would be problematical for anyone with any difficulty walking. But those who welcome a bit of a workout a few times a day, the incline should be appreciated.   Room Tip: Call them and study the photos See more room tips",0
Its one of the best hotels i went during the trip.Very warm and congenial.A very special mention to the owner Marina herself who was very cooperative and made herself available at a very odd hour as well.Courtesy her we were able to see santorini completely so well.,0
"Last 2 days of our tour was with Costa Marina Villas, Fira. Miss Marina made took gr8 care of us & made our stay comfortable. She guided us on the local sightseeing in Fira.The rooms r quite spacious & clean with clean linen.The breakfast served was delicious & she made sure to pack us some breakfast box as we had to catch an early morning flight on the last day.I for sure want to stay at this hotel again for a longer stay soon",0
Was in Santorini with family in September. We went for 24 hours and wanted to do as much as possible in the short period of time. The staff was excellent and went over and above the call of duty to make our stay a memorable one. All from reserving restaurants to rental and transport to and from the port. And all this before we even set foot on the island. Thank you Marina and Maria for being such amazing hosts. I highly recommend Costa Marina Villas!,0
"Family run business. Service and people are amazing. I fell in love with the place. I was traveling alone so help regarding whats to do around and how to get there was welcomed, and Marina really helped me out. My room was beautiful and comfortable. I would definitely go back anytime.",0
"After spending time in a busy city, this quiet location was a perfect fit for our mood (serene and beautiful) and budget. Close and easy access to go exploring both locally in Fira and otherwise via the bus station. And Marina & her staff were incredibly kind and helpful. Great conversation and recommendations. The room was huge with a lovely garden patio, perfect setting for an afternoon drink or your morning coffee. The inn keepers also own a restaurant nearby with very good food and excellent wine in a garden patio setting with lights. Great veggie options on the menu, too. Loved our stay and highly recommend.   Room Tip: All rooms seem excellent. See more room tips",1
"This place is perfect for those who come to Santorini to experience the island and not for staying in a fancy pool! Marina offers great tips, she knows the island and always has great recommendations for restaurants and things to do. I loved that she always showed interest in what we had done during the day and makes an effort to provide a truly personalized experience. No matter where in the island we were going to, she had the perfect restaurant or activity that fit our plans excellently. Overall staying here was a great experience which really enhanced our overall enjoyment of the island.",0
"Great place to stay. The villas is within a 10 minutes walk from the bus station and to the main center of Fira.From the moment we arrived there was a homey feeling and reception was welcoming and helpful in pointing places to visit and to get a SIM card nearby. WIFI was stable and fast at Costa Marina so you don't necessarily need to get a SIM right away, but the location of the store (Germanos) is very conveniently nearby along with slews of restaurants. The room and shower were spacious, clean and comfortable. As we were on the ground floor we also had a little front yard which we could lounge around which was nice. We enjoyed our stay very much. Overall very inexpensive compare to the villas facing west. If your looking for an inexpensive place and don't mind having an immediate sea view this place is highly recommended.",0
"Lovely room - it was a triple and very large feeling with high ceilings, big ensuite bathroom and lovely little balcony and most importantly, very clean. The breakfast was fresh, simple but, delicious. The Greek yoghurt to die for. I really don't think you could ask for anything more if you are staying in Santorini unless you want to pay the prices for a caldera view! It's a very short walk away from all the sights and close to the bus station. We stayed four nights in this lovely little hotel and would recommend to anyone. Is it a five star chain hotel - no, but I'm giving it five stars as everything met or exceeded expectations for the price. Wifi was good especially at night",1
"Had such a lovely week in Santorini. Rooms are clean and spacious with impressive en-suite bathroom. Very affordable accommodation for Santorini which can be quite pricey in general. Ideally located just a 3-5 min walk from central Fira and main bus station. Marina was so lovely and welcoming and helped us rent a quad bike for one of the days (which I'd highly recommend!) Weather a little unusually cool for this time of year - around 22-23 degrees Celsius but still warm enough for swimming, boat trips and a couple of beach days. Nothing too much trouble for Marina and would highly recommend a visit here - hope to return in future!",0
"The location of the hotel is very good, only 5 or so minutes walk from the main part of Fira where all the restaurants and shops are and about the same distance from the local bus station. It's easy to get to the bus station via public bus from the port and the staff provide very clear and easy instructions on how to get to the hotel from there. Despite its central location, the hotel is very quiet, I didn't hear any noise at all. You would probably describe the decor as rustic rather than high end but it was nice to stay in a hotel where the rooms had a bit of character. The hosts are lovely and very helpful in providing recommendations for places to go to, things to see, how to get that photo just like all the postcards you see etc. Nothing seemed like too much trouble. The hotel is obviously not 5 star but for the price you don't expect that. For what I paid, I thought it was extremely good value. I would definitely stay again.",0
"My sister and I stayed at Costa Marina for three nights in September 2015.Our quadruple room was lovely for two, might be a little tight (especially storage wise) for four, but great for us! Simply and beautifully decorated and nice and cool - even without the aircon.The location of the hotel is great for exploring both Fira (nice quiet side street but just a few minutes walk from the old town, sunset views etc) and the rest of the island, centrally located and outside the one-way system so perfect if you have a car. There is also parking on site.The staff were super super friendly and helpful, really wanted to make sure our stay was as nice as possible.The only thing I could fault is the breakfast, very inexpensive but not what we were expecting - there is no choice and not even any indication of what's coming before it arrives, seems a little wasteful if you don't want everything as you can't say beforehand. We chose to just buy fruit and bread from a supermarket and get going earlier.Overall, couldn't recommend this much more highly for those looking for a reasonably priced, simple base for their holiday. We'd definitely go back!   Room Tip: Quad rooms have one bed that is quite inaccessible See more room tips",0
"I was in Santorini for 7 days, and my time there was amazing. Costa Marina staff are just great, they treat you more like family rather than just another guest. Marina and Maria were both great and provided me with a lot of information from the get go. The room was clean and simply decorated, was also very comfortable. Breakfast was also simple but delicious. Costa Marina is located near the town centre of Fira, just a 2 minute walk from stores, restaurants, banks, chemists, bus station which has buses leaving all of the time and the most amazing view of the Caldera. Although Costa Marina is close to town centre is also in a quiet little street so that you are near the centre but not too near the busy areas and noise.   Room Tip: Rooms to the back of the hotel have a view to the ocean. See more room tips",0
"Only after a hotel for one night before catching a ferry this place proved to be a complete gem. Staff were beyond helpful, treated us like friends (even though we only had a single night there) and stayed up to meet us from our arrival close to midnight. Greek hospitality at its very best.",0
"We have experienced the friendliness of the Greeks during our visit to Athens, but when we stepped into Costa Marina Villas in Fira, Santorini - our high perception of the Greeks friendliness was even doubled! Marina and Maria were both very helpful, friendly, and quick to give us suggestions where to go since we were only going to spend 1 full day in Santorini. Marina even offered to print our boarding pass for our next trip because they worried the airline may charge us extra! The room was nice, we saw the sunrise the following morning from our room. And for the sunset, you just have to walk a bit to see it. Fira may not be as famous as Oia, but to us, it's just as mesmerising! Truly enjoyed Santorini even though we were only there for 1 day. When we left, Maria left her desk and sent us to the door. Those in hospitality business can surely learn a lot from these two! If I go back to Santorini one day, I will definitely stay here again.",0
"Two couples stayed 3 nights in Costa Marina after seeing all of the great reviews and we were not disappointed. Upon arrival we were greeted by Maria, who would be a plus for business, and she was enthusiastic in her work. Without asking she drew on a map all of the things to do and how to get there. Our room was pleasant with a large bathroom and a nice patio with our own outside entrance. Breakfast was very nice with yogurt and honey, breads, juice, and egg. The walk to Fira center was about 150 yards. I would recommend Costa Marina to all.   Room Tip: We chose the ground floor with a view of the sea. Rm 103 See more room tips",0
"Marina and her staff are superb. They will help you with everything you need in your trip to Santorini. The location is very close to the center of Fire and you have local buses to go anywhere in Santorini. Also, we recommend getting the breakfast there, which was delicious.",0
"We stayed in Costa Marina Villas for 5 nights in September 2015 and it was excellent. Marina, the owner, and her staff very superfriendly, very helpful and overall amazing hosts. The premises are located 5min away from the central bus station as well as the city center, yet it/s very quiet at night to catch some good sleep. Rooms are spacious, we had a nice, cozy patio and WIFI was also stable and good speed-wise.Breakfast is amazing for 5 EUR/person as you get cappuccino/coffee (or tea if you prefer that), fresh orange juice, delicous bread, Greek yoghurt, some fruits/sweets - and it all tastes great.For first-time visitors: premises are located on the sunRISE (not sunSET) side of Santorini so you will have to walk 5min to watch some of the most amazing sunsets in the world.For divers: Volcano Dive School was very friendly and competent. But (as also the diving school mentioned before we booked) please note there is not super much marine life (due to overfishing) in the sea, but water and visibility is normally great.For Oia sunset visitors: Don/t be too disappointed when you ""share"" the sunset with literally hundreds of other people, next to each other. We prefered a chilled sunset from one of the nice restaurants in Fira (e.g. Argos).",1
We had no idea where to stay when visiting Santorini. This hotel turned out to be fantastic. It was a short 5 minute uphill walk to the main area but just far enough away to be very quiet and relaxing. Our room had a seaview as well to add to the enjoyment. The room is spacious for Europe and it was very clean with a beautiful balcony. The beds were fairly new and probably the most comfortable out of the 6 hotels we stayed at on this trip. The staff was very helpful and made us feel at home. Small con: The parking was very tight and I'm not sure it could accommodate all guests. Not a big problem as there is parking nearby.,0
"Stayed 7 days in Aug 2015. The hotel is centrally located but away from the buzz of the centre, so is ideal if you wish to explore the island i.s.o. staying in a hotel room. The room price is moderate for the island (nothing is cheap in Santorini) but the quality to price is exceptional. Extra-clean rooms and lobby. The hosts (Maria and Marina) were genuine and made us feel welcome, they did all the arrangements we needed. Was a pleasure to meet Marina who as local gave us the tips and tops of the island. Hope to see you again!Pros: Super-friendly and super-helpful hosts, excellent value for money, clean rooms, central location, nice view, well-organizedCons: none so-ever",0
One of the best.Marina and Maria were both so lovley and helpful with everything.the location its centrally 5 minutes by food in the bus station 5 minutes to fira center.The rooms are very clean and comfortable.i will definitely recommend this place!,1
"Set in the heart of Fira, this hotel is outstanding value for money.Service is unbelievable and hotel staff including Marina always happy and accommodating.Rooms are clean and toilets/shower spotless.You would pay 3 times the rate and not match these standards!!",1
"I loved staying at Costa Marina Villas... it is super clean, and the service is exceptional!It is only a short walk from downtown on a quiet street, perfect location. Breakfast was delicious. Marina has the best suggestions on how to get around in Santorini and great suggestions for places to eat and what to do. I have finally sat down to review all the places I've visited and even though its been 2 years since I was there I will never forget the night I was feeling sick... My friends, Marina and I had planned a night out in town... when Marina heard I was ill she came to the villa to check up on me and offered tea and cold medication and extra blanket, making sure I was as comfortable as possible, even left her home phone number in case I needed anything in the middle of the night. Being so far from home it was nice to have someone 'care' for you when you feel that way... (of course my friend was also there for me) but you don't see an owner of a hotel be so accommodating as her, she made me feel as if I was staying with family.....Thank you Marina!!If I go back to Santorini I'm staying at Costa Marina Villas again!",1
"Costa Marina Villas are an excellent choice for travellers who are looking for value for money, coupled with excellent hospitality. A stay here will undoubtedly be truly memorable once you meet Marina, the vivacious , warm and enterprising owner , who is truly one of a kind. She made sure we were well taken care of and made us feel like we were living with family. She was very helpful in helping us secure a very reasonable car rental, as well as recommending eateries & places to see . Our room was on the second floor and had a wonderful sunrise view, which truly was a sight to behold. The main thoroughfare and even a Carrefour supermarket ( for basic necessities) are within walking distance from the villas. We will definitely be going back to Costa Marina Villas on our next visit to Santorini and recommending it to all our family and friends!!!",1
"Very clean hotel in the centre of Fira. Just 3 minutes walk from the downtown. Marina (the owner) is very helpful. You will feel like home. As for the prices, you can realise that its among the cheapest in Fira.Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Marina is born for running a hotel- in all my travels I never encountered someone as warm and accommodating. Struck down with a terrible cold whilst in Santorini Marina went above and beyond to accommodate me- making me tea and giving me vitamins and also offering us a late check out.The room was perfect and exactly as in the pictures with beautiful ice cold air con and a gorgeous shower that made you feel like you had the real Santorini experience. Breakfast was excellent and included fruit, boiled egg, yogurt and pastries.Located only a couple of hundred meters from Fira main square, the location was excellent for both sunset and resteraunts and of course Marina was the best host in the entire world. Thanks again.",1
"I would commend Marina, the owner, for keeping the price low at this villa. She could easily get more money, especially during the high season, but chooses to keep this beautiful and somewhat secluded place affordable. From what I have seen thus far, this villa is a great mix of value and luxury. - You are about a 5 minute walk into downtown Fira. - The hotel, including rooms and facilities, are very clean. - There is not a pool. We rented a scooter and went south to the beaches. - Fira is very busy, but is a central location on Santorini. It serves a great jumping off point for daily activities. Overall, Marina is very genuine and friendly. She is one of the few on Santorini who understand the importance of good customer service.",1
"We had to stay one day in Santorini due to a delay of our flight and we booked a room for four persons. Rooms are modern, equipped with the necessary. Our room had a small balcony, but only two of us could fit...There was hot water at rush hours. Our room had an aircondition and a fridge. There was a small problem with the two beds, because they were in an attic and we had to use an escalator, but it was ok. I mean for one night it was ok, but if it were for more, there would be a problem (where to put your stuff..?). So, if you are more than two, clarify it in advance. The hotel served breakfast for 5 euro/person, but we were in a rush and didn't have time to try it. The place was very clear, with nice flowers and very spruce. The hostess was amazing! Ver polite, genial and helpful! And she is a young girl, caring for the business! The place is very centrally located, a couple of minutes away from restaurants, bars, shops and Caldera. The price for one night and in high season was 120 euro/night/room/4 beds, which was really good (having in mind that a couple of days later we had booked another similar room at a nearby place, which was not that good and they charged us 140 euro/night/room/4 beds). I definitely recommend this place for a short or long stay!",0
"My wife and two daughters had two rooms at Costa Marina for four nights in late May. Spotless, small, quiet hotel off the main drag in Thira but an easy 5 minute walk to main street or the bus stop. Pretty room. Lovely balcony view down to the east coast of Santorini. Very pleasant and helpful staff. All the other reviews are correct - this is a little gem of a hotel and we couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically.",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel because it was recommended by a greek friend. We totally loved it and highly recommend it. The room and bathroom were very clean, spacious and comfortable. They were nicely decorated. The location was great, as it was literally 5 min to the centre of Fira and the hotel has a private parking space which is incredible convenient for the spot! Marina and Maria were very nice, gave us many tips of the island and made us feel like home! It was a very special hotel.",0
"My wife and I stayed at Costa Marina Villas for only 1 night, but next time we go to Santorini we will stay for longer. The owner is extremely welcoming, nice, and helpful. They go out of their way to assist guests with information about Santorini better than any place I've been.  The hotel is quite lovely and a great base for which to explore the island. It's about a 7 minute walk to the Fira bus station and 5 minute walk to the shops of Fira. The hotel is in a quiet location far enough from any noise from the town. The rooms are nicely furnished with everything you need.The biggest asset that the hotel has is the owner and staff who helped us plan our itinerary and gave us great ideas for our time in Santorini. Thanks!",1
"I really liked my stay at Costa Marina. There are so many choices of places to stay in Santorini but when you're on a budget some places can be really spotty - Costa Marina was the exception. It was clean, well located out of the madness of the centre of Fira but only a 2 minute walk, and comfortable. Can't remember the room class that I booked but the room was enormous and my ground floor patio was a nice addition. The only downside was that the wifi barely worked at all in the room. The highlight of the hotel however is Marina herself - fun, bubbly, super helpful, name remembering, and genuinely welcoming. In a way it felt like I was staying at an old friend's place. Would I stay here again? Ideally, I'd have money to blow and I could get a caldera view, infinity pool place :) but if I were on a budget? Absolutely.",1
"After the chaos and crowds from the ferry port, bus station and downtown Thira in general, reaching the Costa Marina Villas was like drinking a glass of cool water on a hot day. It was a little tricky to reach from the bus station (mainly because we were lugging bags on cobblestone and not taking the most efficient route!) - Google Maps eventually pointed us in the right direction. From the moment you step foot onto the grounds, you are greeted by a beautiful large home draped in colorful flowers. Most of our interaction was with Marina - the gracious, friendly and helpful owner who made us feel so welcome. She had recommendations on places to visit based upon our interest, where to buy Vin Santo (definitely pick up some bottles to take home) and lent us books to read up on additional topics of interest. Thanks to her, we were able to make the most of our three days in Santorini. Breakfast was OK and a good deal for five Euros (freshly squeezed OJ was especially appreciated). Great free WiFi - lots of access points to choose from so signal was always strong. We stayed in a ground floor room with a double bed - clean and quiet room (even though it was beside the lobby) with a small bathroom. Only minor complaint was that the shower hose had no fixture to hold it on the wall, so you had to hold it up to rinse yourself. Our room had a small balcony with a view to the non-caldera side of the island. Highly recommend staying here! Easy walk (albeit short hills) to the caldera views, restaurants etc.",0
"perfect location, clean and spacious room with a balcony and a view, and a simple but sufficient breakfast. Marina, the front desk lady, was very effective and helpful. A talk with her during the check-in bascially helped me to fix the logistic details of my stay in Santorini.",0
"Costa Marina Villas was a great choice for my stay in Santorini. From the directions provided by Marina by email, I found the Villas quickly, just a few minutes from the bus station. You approach through a pretty courtyard, which instantly made me feel that I'd arrived somewhere lovely. My room was simple, but it was very nice, with a window looking onto the inner courtyard, lots of space, a wardrobe with adequate hangers (unusual!) and a cute, spotless bathroom. There are a lot of nice elements - good quality linens and furniture, a writing desk, a fridge and a kettle. They provide a large bottle of mineral water which is replaced when you run out: that was a particularly nice touch, as it saved having to find a mini-market as soon as I arrived and kept me well supplied with water to handle the heat. Breakfast is good, too: a simple but nice selection of food. Wifi is excellent.Marina and her colleagues are very kind and welcoming, and Marina's advice on things to do in Santorini is exceptional.The location of the Villas is great, partly because of the proximity to the small bus station from which every bus to places like Akrotiri, Pyrgos and Vlighada leaves. You are a few minutes' walk to the heart of Thira, and you can walk all over town and up to the dramatic volcano views as you head out of Thira towards Firostefani. The streets can be pretty busy, so amenities like an excellent pharmacy and nice places to eat within strolling distance of the accommodation were a bonus.If I had to sum up the Villas, they are an oasis of calm and good quality: everything is simply presented and exceptionally nice. They are an absolute bargain too, and I was very pleased to have found them for my visit to Santorini.",1
"Nestled away, is this beautiful little oasis , run by a mega friendly and helpful owner called Marina who really made us feel welcome from the minute we arrived. The hotel is really tastefully decorated with whitewashed walls and exposed stonework. Vibrant plants and flowers border the paths and climb the walls creating a beautiful, relaxing break. We had room three which is impeccably clean and thoughtfully presented. It's on the groundfloor and offers a limited view of the sea. Outside, It has a small terrace with beautiful flowers cascading down from all sides, chairs and a handy bistro table , which offer a clear view of the sea, where we were able to enjoy our morning coffee in full sunshine . The bed was large and comfortable, the shower huge , air con quiet and efficient, and the fridge was a nice touch too.The centre of town is a few minutes walk, and the all important view of the caldera can easily be achieved within ten minutes. All in all we have been overjoyed by our stay, and highly recommend you give it a try.NB There is no sign at all of the Greek economic crisis in Santorini. Buses, taxis, restaurants and shops all continue to operate as normal, and the sun keeps shining. O",1
"Before we even get to Santorini, Marina has kept us in the loop with email communication. We got there earlier than the check-in time and Marina offered water and wealth of information about the island. We were given two room choices, a family room (huge) or a new suite which was built last September. We chose the new suite and I was surprised, it looked amazing for the price. The room and the bathroom were extremely clean!Don't expect any kind of view because if you want to get a mountain top view, you have to pay many times more for those hotels. Costa Marina Villas is a simple and clean guest house.The hotel is just 5 minutes walk to the main bus station in Fira which is the like the downtown area. If you rented a car or ATV, there is a small parking lot inside the hotel.   Room Tip: Ask for their new suites. See more room tips",0
"If asked why I would go back to Santorini, Costa Marina Villas would definitely be one of my top reasons! Stayed at this amazing traditional Greek guesthouse back in May with my wife and we've never felt so much at home, thanks to such warm Greek Hospitality & the simple beauty of the place. Such an exceptional experience that I even wrote a blog post about it on my website (here's the link for more photos: http://arencejean.com/santorini-island-heaven-on-earth-part2-costa-marina-villas-santorini/)Location: Costa Marina Villas may not be located on the western side of Santorini Island where the famous caldera view is but it allowed us to experience the quieter and more rural side of the island which we think is one of the main essence of staying in a rural Cycladic Village; also, this side gave us an unobstructed high ground view of the majestic blues of the Aegean Sea. I know that the caldera is the major attraction of the island but fret not as the caldera is just a 5-10 minute walk away from the hotel. Also, Costa Marina Villas is just 5 minutes away from Fira's bus station, which is the main bus station of Santorini, allowing us to explore the whole of the island as all bus routes starts from there. At night, it is the perfect place to relax as it provided us a break away from the busy, touristy western side of Fira.Hotel Features: The hotel is a nice whitewashed straightforward Cycladic architectural work. We believe we loved this hotel so much because of its simplicity, nothing lavish, nothing grandiose, just the perfect feel of being at home. It has an inner courtyard garden which we really liked a lot. Also, there's free parking for those who rented cars while in the island.Service: One of the best, most accommodating, and warmest hospitality we had in our travels was at Costa Marina Villas. Check-In with Maria, who was at the front desk was wonderful! Always with a smile on her face, she gave us all the information we needed, two sets of keys (one for our room and the other for the main hotel door as the front desk is manned only till 10pm) and assisted us to our rooms and explained its amenities. Marina, who was at night shift was a fun person to talk with as well!Note: No need to research for Santorini bus schedules before hand as Costa Marina Villas provide guests with a printed copy of it at check-in! Wifi is also free and very fast.Rooms: What can I say? The room was great - firstly and most importantly because of the balcony facing the Aegean, treating us with one of the best, unobstructed views of the Santorini Sunrise - a sublime experience that could easily match the world-famous sunset at Oia! The room featured a flat screen TV, a personal fridge with complimentary water, a water boiler with complimentary tea and coffee refilled everyday. It was also very clean! Storage was not a problem as there are wooden closets to keep your stuff and a safe to keep your valuables. The bed was very comfortable and the overall interior of the room was nice, starting from the cross-vaulted ceiling to interior accents such as a book shelf filled with Greek Poetry books which we appreciated even though we didn't know how to speak Greek ha-ha! Lastly and crucial for us, smoking is allowed in the balcony.Tip: The hotel has 20 rooms, 15 of which has patios or balcony facing the eastern side and 5 facing the inner garden - Request for the Eastern Facing rooms or specifically room 23 which was our room!Breakfast: We always had a breakfast at the dining hall of the hotel but Marina informed us that guests may request to have it served in our room. The food selection had bread and various spreads, fruits, eggs, Greek Yogurt with honey and some berries.

"This hotel benefits from its vantage point overlooking the stunning Aegean Sea -- the views are absolutely gorgeous.  You can spend hours here just snapping away envy-inducing photos to show friends back home.That said, we honestly felt that most of the charm and 'wow' factor of this hotel is in the view.  The actual rooms and service lagged the 5 star view.For starters -- having noted that it was a special occasion stay, we were never greeted with an acknowledgement of our occasion.  To their credit, they were kind enough to bump us to a larger room. But while it's probably very common for people to come here on their honeymoon or other romantic occasion, an extra step goes a long way to prevent one from feeling like 'just another couple.' The hotel could do a better job of adding a personal touch.One quirk given its location is that there are quite a number of non-guests opportunistically looking to staircase down into the hotel to take photos.  We were interrogated on two separate days by the hotel staff while we were taking photos and mistaken for tourists that were not staying at the hotel.  On another day, my parents, who were also staying here, were asked to stop taking photos. When my parents asked why, the hotel staff responded that this property was only for guests. I totally understand where they're coming from (and I've accepted their apology); they don't want to allow random yahoos and philistines in and ruin the ambience.  But I have to think that they can develop a better system for monitoring this (extra staff member at the front?) so guests don't feel like they're getting held to the fire each time.Rooms - could definitely use more investment.  The paint job in our suite looked quite haphazard (see photo), with many areas brushed over unevenly with new paint.  On one of our nights, we experienced a power outage that left our jacuzzi running loudly, preventing us from sleeping from 3am to 6am. The manager Jacqueline Evangelou apologized and followed up with the technicians to turn the bathtub off.  But we were left with no jacuzzi for the remainder of our stay and were not offered anything to make up for this disturbance and very stressful night.  In other 5 star hotels (and I've experienced this also in other LHW hotels), a hotel may offer compensation in the form of a round of drinks, food, or even a spa service, as a show of goodwill; but in this case Jacqueline only gave an apology. For a 3 to 4 star property, this would've been acceptable; but as a 5 star hotel, this really should have been common sense for a luxury hotel manager.  I suspect that it is due to her inexperience in the hospitality industry given her short tenure here. I'd point out that the service level of the wait staff by the pool, restaurant, and the luggage handlers were superb (so much so that we tipped the handlers 30 euros when leaving), so my disappointment rests more with the management of the hotel. When we raised these aforementioned issues upon checkout, the assistant manager offered to take a Pina Colada off my bill and promised us that we would get a preferential rate on our next visit to the hotel. Gee, thanks. Instead of making promises into the future why not focus on making amends in the present? Would love to have a conversation with Katikies' parent company management to offer suggestions if I could.Bugs - worth noting that there were quite a number of ants and fruitflies in our unit. My wife told me she had to squash 8 of them each night prior to sleeping. While lounging poolside we heard two other couples mentioning this as well.  They were of no harm and probably indigenous to the island, but just pointing out as a small nuisance.Katikies has done very well in recent years and gathered a number of accolades in the hospitality industry.  It should strive to constantly improve itself and go the extra step, rather than rest on its laurels and watch the bottom line.  Its guests would take notice, and the hotel would benefit in tandem",0
"Everything here was absolutely spot on. Great service, good food, very knowledgeable staff and most importantly, when there was a problem, they solved it quickly and efficiently. No excuses, we're sorry your driver is stuck in traffic, let us figure it out (which they did in 15 minutes) and we will compensate you for it. Please accept our sincerest apologies. That's the kind of service I can get behind, owning up to a mistake, not the ""our hotel policy dictates........"" Great job guys, will be happy to return hopefully sooner than later.

"Santorini is for relaxing - otherwise it is hard work. Luckily this hotel is everything one needs. The service is very very good,with extremely attentive and friendly staff who simply cannot do enough for you. This is not a place for anyone who has trouble with stairs - don't go there to recover from a hip or knee operation!The rooms are all good per other guests. We had no2 right next to the main lower pool. It was fine. The bed is very good, the air con works well, the bathroom is very good with a large spa bath that two can enjoy together. The only minor issue is that there does not seem to be very much cupboard space but not a real concern.The breakfast choice is fine but not the widest/ largest one can imagine - expect that after 5 days one might start wondering what to choose but the food there is excellent and fresh. Nothing better than eating looking over the calderas.The pool areas are small but get all day sun.Ios itself is nice with a fair selection of shopping and restaurants. If you are brave then ignore the concierge telling you about the smell of the donkeys and take a walk down the hundreds of steps to Armeni beach and have lunch in the single tavern there - everything is delicious, but remember you have to walk back up ( and dive straight into the pool!), also go through the town down another few hundred steps to Ammoudi port and have a seafood/fish meal there at one of the 4 choices - get a taxi home - they will call one for you. However the hard work part of Ios is if you want to go anywhere else - it's a mission with terrible traffic and 30-40 min to the beaches. Nightlife in Fira is also a fair 20-30 minutes. Apparently only 34 taxis on the island so better be patient. If you are happy with an exquisite hotel and amazing views etc then it's an easy choice, if you want nightlife and beaches - go to Mykonos - it's as easy as that.",1
"We are still on holiday in paradise and I have to say the service here is impeccable !! You could not ask for better service in a 5 star hotel All the staff are so friendly and helpful you don't feel uncomfortable like some hotels I have stayed in . The rooms are lovely with a sea view over the small harbour I would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family . The locations is excellent the hotel is situated in the town centre with loads of restaurants , bars and boutique shops (lovely for a stroll ) If you have a busy lifestyle like ours this is the place to relax and get away from the city life .",0
"Without question the best hotel in Santorini and possibility in all of Greece. In terms of service maybe the best I have ever experienced and I have stayed at some of the best hotels throughout the world (will elaborate on service below). The Katikies is a true five tool player. 1. Location: jaw dropping views of the Caldera and the perfect location in the best town on the island. 2. Food: three restaurants and the food at each one was outstanding. We ate off property at some of the top places but found the food on property much better. Excellent wine and cocktail lists complemented the restaurants nicely. 3. Rooms: We booked a superior suite (Room 51) and it was spectacular. Spacious, great amenities and in my opinion the best terrace and location at the hotel. The terrace was approx. 250 square feet with a fabulous sun bed. It may have been the best spot on the island. 4. Amenities: Awesome Spa, three fantastic pools, beautiful appointments and detail...all needs are anticipated. 5. Service: The friendliness and attentiveness of the staff was unparalleled. Every need was anticipated....when you exited the pool you were presented with a towel, when the ice in your drink began to melt it was quickly refilled, if your sun glasses appeared smudged or fogged a soft cloth was handed to you, when I pulled out a cigar, a cutter, lighter and ashtray magically appeared, the staff was simply remarkable, I can't say enough.   Room Tip: Room 51 is a must (Superior Suite). Great location and unbelievable terrace. See more room tips",0
"So the first thing you think of when you Santorini is beauty!!! The Katikies is beauty and perfection!!! From the second you walk in the hotel treats you like royalty!! Each guest is given a cell phone. This phone is used to contact the front desk or concierge for any thing which you need. The assistant Manager Sophia took us on a tour of the hotel. It is a draw dropping experience!!! After we got settled we went to the one of three gorgeous pools. I do recommend going to the largest pool which is on the 1st level where breakfast is served. It is the best ""sun"" pool. I would get you chairs and then enjoy the amazing breakfast which in included with every room. It is a little difficult to get chairs. Which is a concern, the earlier you get down stairs and reserve a chair the better. My husband and I went to the pool at 10:00 am. Your towel is always perfect on the chairs. The second you get up one of the most amazing staff members will come over to fix your towel. If you decide to go for a swim, no worries a staff member will run to a ladder and cover you with a dry towel. The staff, every one is friendly and awesome.  Each drink is amazing at the downstairs bar is creative and different. You tell the bartender what you like and you favorite drink and watch what he will create!!  The food is very good, warning it is a little on the expensive side. 45.00 Euros for a hamburger or 35.00 Euros for a sushi platter. In the afternoon the concierge walk down to each and every guest to talk about where you are eating that night and will call the resturant to make sure you get the best table. You will be very very happy at the Katikies. My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here and it was such a great decision. Just sit back and enjoy every second",0
"We loved every minute of our stay here. From our beautiful room with views of the ocean to the fantastic staff, you can't go wrong staying here. The service is the top of the top and so friendly. Everything was clean and beautiful. We loved hanging by the pool area and relaxing the calm, all white room. We hope to come back ASAP!!   Room Tip: Our room was high up which we like (41). We didn't notice the people walking on the street above... See more room tips",0
"This was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had. From the moment you step on the property you received undivided attention from every staff member. Great location, views that take your breath away, privacy, spacey rooms. Special thanks to the hotel manager Jacqueline Evangelou.   Room Tip: Any room has a sea view See more room tips",0
"Hotel has beautiful views and location is great but i've been to many 5 stars and this has three issues that i am sure others at Oia with this price point and category would not be making this basics mistakes:1) Amenities in the room - Non existence, we used one soap (which by the way has not brand and is not a Korres ) and they never replaced. No body lotion, nothing to pamper you on this price you pay2) Breakfast - Every single day there was the same old fruits available and always the same. Watermelon and pineapple. They did not even bother to replace with fresh ones, it was clear the same from day before. How can you not have wonderful fruits like peaches, cherries and etc in this 5 star hotel at Greece?3) Management - No place available to sit at the pool and when you go to the reception, manager acts as she is doing me a favor and find a place for me to sit. Horrible atitude. Day after they decide to hang new fans on the sitting area by the pool with noise and dust during pool hours. Couldn't they do before high season or at night but it has to be in the morning after breakfast when everyone is on the pool?So this is a care and service you would expect for the 700 euro price and 5 star hotel they claim they are?",4
We have stayed in a few 5 stars hotel before but this is another level... The staff are always on the ball and they treat their guests like kings and Queens... The breakfast is very good and the restaurant on the pools are really good too... The room was spacious and modern... The views are simply stunning... We will be returning this hotel definitely again..,0
"It was one of the best stays in my life, extraordinary service always with friendliness and attentiveness. Impressed by every detail. We stayed in the Katikies suite which has a very tasteful design and a lot of space with private terrace and jacuzzi. Views are amazing from every point of the property.We tried the Seltz and the Mikrasia restaurants during our stay, and enjoyed the food a lot.Thanks again for this magical stay to Mrs.Evangelou and her team.",1
"The hotel and location are pure perfection and close to everything whether you want to shop, eat, drink, dance, and etc. Complimentary breakfast right on your balcony was delish. The bed is cozy and comfortable - I slept like a baby each night of my stay. Each room also comes with a cellphone which is also nice if you get lost or need the hotel to make a reservation for you when you're out. It was an unforgettable vacation and stay at this gem of a hotel.",2
"Hi,Visited Katikies with my family at the start of June and it is just the most wonderful hotel we have ever stayed at. From the location which I will not repeat what others have already said (although words don't do it justice) to the level of service and quality of the food it is just the most relaxing place we have had the privilege to have spent time at. We spent 10 days and nights being looked after by the team and special thanks go to;Maria, Rose, Lucy and Kate who ensured we never wanted for anything at Seltz.Ntalas and Thanasis who looked after all our cocktail needs throughout the stay. Thank you for your great cocktails and for trying out a few new ones including the Mastika (a new favourite).For those reading this if you are undecided on whether to spend some time at Katikies don't , book it now and you'll not be disappointed.I would like to thank all the team and look forward to a return stay some day",3
"Overall Description: There are not enough wonderful adjectives out there to describe this amazing property and service. The property is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views over the Caldera and three infinity pools to take in the views. The rooms are extremely well appointed and the food and drinks are terrific. And no where I have ever stayed is the service better. Rooms: There are approximately 35 rooms on the property, which is a lot for Oia. However, all rooms are well designed with a private terrace where one can have their breakfast from 8 am - 11 am. Call room service about 30 minutes in advance and your breakfast will arrive. This includes hot and cold dishes. Quite an experience. For three nights my wife and stayed in a junior suite, which was an upgrade (thanks!). The last night the hotel upgraded us to the Katikies Suite, which was such a treat. If you can afford it or want to splurge, it's the largest and coolest room in the hotel. Highly recommend. Food and Beverage: We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel, which they would serve to us on our terrace 30 minutes after calling room service. Breakfast is included and great. However, we did eat one day at the Seltz Bar and the food blew me away. It was excellent. There are so many places to eat in Santorini but my one regret is not having at least one more meal on property. The sushi (yes, I know) looked fantastic and everyone I spoke to who was eating it raved about it. And of course the wine and bubbles were on point.Service: The one thing which separates Katikies from its competitors, or other hotels I have stayed at, is it's service. Whether it was offering us a towel right after we emerged from the pool, putting individual ice cubes in our water, or delivering our bubbles to us while we were in the pool, it was always top notch and fantastic. Could not have asked for friendlier or warm staff. I hope to get back to Katikies sooner rather than later.   Room Tip: Stay at a junior suite down at the bottom of the property for the most privacy See more room tips",1
"15 years ago my wife and I traveled through the islands spending 3 nights in some obscure hotel in Santorini. Walking through Oia, we stopped at Katikies, took a brief tour and promised ourselves we would return. That return happened this past May and we stayed a full week at Katikies. We wish it could have been a month or a year. Simply stunning and the service is 14 on scale of 10. We would not change a thing. Breakfasts were over the top. The rooms and veranda's were comfortable and private. The views are breathtaking. Katikies is a 5 star hotel in heaven. Special kudos to Filitsia and Mary who took care of us with a warm smile each day. We miss them both......wanted to bring them home. We travel alot and I am not easy to please (see some of my past reviews). This is the Hotel that we will always remember and return. Simply the Best!   Room Tip: More privacy with larger suites; spend the extra money and you will have a private villa See more room tips",0
"From the moment you arrive at Katikies, you will be entranced by the beauty of the hotel, mesmerised by the views of the Caldera and Agean, and bowled over by the warmth, friendliness and level of service by all the staff. We spent a week at Katikies for my partners birthday. The weather was dry and hot, perfect for days lazing next to one of the three swimming pools. Service before arriving at the hotel managing restaurant reservations on our behalf was helpful and efficiently dealt with.Arriving at the hotel after what felt like a long day travelling from London, we were greeted with the warmest smiles and glasses of fresh and thirst quenching lemonade with ginger and cold towels in reception. From that moment on, we knew that the service was going to be spot on and it didn't disappoint. All the staff, from the barman Vangelis with his wicked cocktails, to waitresses Kate and Maria, to the manager Jacqueline, had the perfect balance of efficient service with real warmth and willingness to make your stay a memorable one. There wasn't one moment when we could fault the staff.The hotel is built into a steep mountainside so be prepared for stairs. There are two lifts but thats no fun!. Our room was a little further from the centre of the hotel than we would have liked but did have the best views of the Caldera.All the food was lovely......we hardly left the hotel apart from two dinners at other restaurants and one day on a catamaran. The food in Seltz Champagne bar is gorgeous. Definitely try the Wagyu sushi roll, the various fish dishes were delicious and fresh and oh my word, the Wagyu Burger is sensational.Service around the pool was on the ball. Don't dare touch your own umbrella to move the shade....staff will be on you in seconds to take over and do it for you. Throughout the day pool service involved straightening towels while you are swimming and constantly drying the pool surrounds so you don't slip. There is a consistency to the service in the hotel which is lovely. All the staff were such lovely, friendly characters who were happy to engage but who also knew when it was best to leave you in peace. When we left, our farewell was like that from a long know friend who can't wait to see you again. The room we had was well appointed. We had a separate bedroom and lounge area. The shower was over the bath and at very busy times such as just before dinner you could notice a drop in water pressure but this was only noticeable on one day out of seven. A small issue that we raised was a door to the road from out little patio which had been left unlocked by workers but this was dealt with very quickly and a genuine apology for inconvenience from the hotel manager was appreciated.There is a spa on the property for massages, other treatments not covered at the hotel were available at the sister property nearby.I really cannot emphasise how lovely the property, the staff and the setting are. I cannot wait to get back to Katikies.",1
"Amazing hotel, Amazing rooms, Amazing location, amazing food & amazing views!! Had the wonderful stay. It is perfect for couples. Special thanks to hotel manager Jacqueline who gave us an upgraded room in another property in request.   Room Tip: Go as down as possible. Near to the pool is better. See more room tips",0
We visited at the end of June. Great hotel in nearly every way. Staff are fabulous. Everywhere spotlessly clean. Spoilt only by intrusive music by both pools - too loud and you can't get away from it. May suit some but not us.,2
"My friends and I stayed here for part of our Santorini vacation and everything about this place was amazing! If heaven is a place on earth, I'm convinced that it's here. First of all the views from the hotel were breathtaking..An even better experience than the views, was the service here. The whole staff was always attentive to our every need. The food was fantastic.. We ate here both of the nights of our stay. We decided to experience the hookah bar and also grab some drinks and our bartender Vangelis, made us some amazing cocktails and made me a ginger tea that was his own special recipe. He was a true mixologist!! His cocktails were so good that we went back the next night before we went out.Needless to say, I was extremely happy with my overall experience at Katikies and would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Santorini!!!",4
"Location: the beginning of the pedestrian walkway...perfect location to fine restaurants and boutiques. Absolutely stunning views!Room: 32... Loved it! Bedroom in loft area...bathroom with shower and tub. Room overlooked infinity pool that was virtual ours most of the time.Hotel: beautiful, upscale, immaculately clean. 3 beautiful infinity pools...water perfect temperature.....and oh those magical views!Staff: the staff was amazing! Always anticipating your next need! Special thanks to Sophia, Alexia, Rose, and Kate....you were the best!Island restaurants that we enjoyed: Selene in Pyrgos....our favorite! Ambrosia in Oia, Anthros at the sister property (kirini), and of course, Mikrasia at the Katikies. For authentic Greek food try Roka off the pedestrian walk way. Always request a roof top table for wonderful caldera view!While on the island we visited the ruins of pre-historic Akrotiri, visited some wineries, ate dinner on the harbor....all not to be missed but the highlight for us was a sunset cruise on a sunset Oia catamaran! It was truely a memorable experience!   Room Tip: 32 very quiet overlooking infinity pool See more room tips",3
"We were Off Season in Santorini and staid 4 Nights in the Hotel Katikies. The Hotel was great (location, view, room, pool, food and staff). I would go again off season as there are not many Tourist and you have Santorini almost for you. No Reservation needed for Restaurants and the nice village Oia with the beautiful Sunset was not crowded.",1
"Wow, talk about living in the lap of luxury! Hotel Katikies is what you would expect to see in Oia: a small (34 room) upscale resort nestled into the side of the island with an incredible view of the Caldera and Aegean. It’s perfectly situated at the beginning of the long pedestrian walkway that goes toward Ammoudi Bay and is lined with shops, restaurants and tons of views & domes for photo opportunities. The hotel has lots of steep narrow stairs that you have to get used to; rooms and infinity pools are small but beautiful. The staff and service are first-rate; kudos to several of the staff in particular who we got to know a bit and were so friendly and helpful: Maria, Rose, Lucy, Alexia, George and Thanos. My favorite part of their wonderful breakfast buffet was the Bellini’s and the beautiful lattes (as pictured); we also enjoyed their snack/lunch and wine menu and had one of the best roses (from Santorini) we’ve ever had.",0
"This place is heaven on earth! The location, right on the edge of Oia and the staff are excellent...as they said when we arrived 'there are no rules here, it is what the guest wants'. We could not fault the service, the food and the friendly nature of all the staff. The hotel itself is amazing, the accommodation perfect and immaculately clean, the food caters for all tastes, breakfasts to die for and the staff, from the top down are fantastic as nothing is too much trouble.It is very rare to find a place which you can honestly say is faultless....We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and some day hope to return!!Simon & Freya x   Room Tip: All rooms have fantastic views See more room tips",1
"Katikies Hotel is incredible. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, everything here was perfect. Every single individual who works at this hotel is friendly, thoughtful, and warm. The location of the hotel couldn't be more perfect to watch the beautiful sunrises on Santorini. And the style of the hotel is modern, yet kept traditional on the exterior to keep with the Santorini style, and semi/or private balconies. Additionally, the food was to die for- every meal we had with the hotel, from room service in the morning, at the pool in the afternoon, or in one of their intimate dinner rooms was fresh food and equisitely made. Stephanos the wine sommelier was so knowledgeable about the Santorini wines from the island, and provided us the best pairings I've had anywhere. Definitely a must stay location if you are going to be visiting Santorini. This place will always have a special place in my heart since this was for my honeymoon- I will only stay here when we come back to visit.",0
Me and my friends spent the most relaxful time. All the hotel staff do everything to make us feel relax the whole time. The hotel rooms are very clean and the food serve has a lot of variety. The hotel has the most beatiful view around. Thank you guys for everything.,0
"the best hotel I've ever visited. I love Greece, and I visited few islands but santorini was one of my favourite. Katikies was really nice, with very well equipped, elegant and clean rooms. I loved the view :D We spend here trully fantastic and romantic time. Thank you!",0
"We recently statyed in Hotel Katikies and the service was exceptional, the views are spectacular, and the food was delicious! Our room was spacious, tastefully decorated, and the staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating. Special thanks to Jacqueline for doing everything possible to make our stay as amazing as it was. My only tiff was that they do not have an iron in the room, nor will they provide one to you. So I would recommend you bring your own mini travel steamer. If you wish to press your clothes they will iron them for you, but there is a charge. I always touch up my clothes prior to going out so this is somewhat of a big deal for me. Our stay was short so it wasn't an issue. I was however impressed that they had a REAL blow dryer in my room as oppose to the mini low powered blow dryers you generally find in most hotels and overall between the views, food, and excellent service our stay was fantastic. I would highly recommend!",0
"We returned recently from our first trip to Santorini. What a gorgeous location! We stayed 3 nights at Katikies, and I am still thinking about the beautiful views over the caldera. Our stay was great except for the multiple steps. My husband has some residual right-sided weakness from a stroke 2 years ago, still has some difficulty particularly going down steps. I realize it is nearly impossible to build a place on the side of a cliff without having some steps; however, these are uneven and have no handrails. There are 2 elevators--one of which worked only part of the time during our stay. I actually think this place would be difficult even for someone who has the misfortune of suffering a broken leg just before the trip. A handrail would certainly be helpful (paint it white--it would blend right in!). Even our room had steps up to the bed, and then up to the bathroom, making getting up at night challenging! Despite the above notes, however, the staff here were excellent. Everyone we came into contact with was very friendly, courteous, and always ready to help my husband navigate the steps. The food is very good--breakfast by the pool was great! We also enjoyed dinner at Seltz. The location is good as you can step right out onto the pedestrian walkway and make your way to the restaurants and shops. Thanks again to all the staff!   Room Tip: Room tip: We had Room 20 which is small but in a good location near the restaurant and pool with a... See more room tips",0
"This place is stunning and the service is great but there were a few annoying things, mostly about the room, that made our stay not quite a 5 star when considering the price we paid. Our suite was great; however it took many, many flights of stairs up and down to get there. This is not a hotel for people with weak knees or other physical issues. Our room had a pull out sofa below and loft with king bed upstairs and i can seriously see how those stairs are accident waiting to happen. There are no rails and the stairs change direction and have a smooth surface so all it would take is someone who drank too much (and we saw a lot of those!) or is unsteady on their feet as one wrong step would land you on the concrete floor below. The shower has no curtain or door so no matter how careful we were, there would always be water all over the floor. The toilet was running our whole stay and i reported it twice but it was never fixed. I also think a hotel of this caliber should provide complimentary bottled water --not just the one bottle at turn down but with meals and by the pool so one isn't having to spend $50 on water daily (hotel recommended only drinking bottled water which is also a shame as no one on the island seems to recycle). There is a mini market next door (buy water for your room!), but we felt like they'd not appreciate us drinking it publicly. This is based on the fact that when we were at the pool and asked for an ice bucket for the complimentary bottle of wine they gave us at check in, they would not allow it. Instead we had to spend 80 euro for a bottle even though we would have gladly paid a corkage fee. There was a shortage of chairs at the lower pool so unless you reserved a spot early on you were shut out, then the higher pool was also filled. They allow people to vacate the pool chairs for hours but keep them reserved. There was a third pool closer to our room but it was depressing and no one ever sat there. On the plus side the food is excellent and we loved the selection and service at the buffet breakfast. Their restaurant by the upper pool had the best dips and greek salad around. The staff is friendly and works hard. It is a truly beautiful property with spectacular views and a great location in Oia.",2
"Stayed there for 5 days and 4 nights, our room is upgraded to room 37 which have a nice caldera view. The location of the hotel is really convenient and environment is nice too. However, the management and overall staff are trained but not to the standard of the hotel that they think they are at, ( for example, reception staff are not helpful sometimes). And also there is no kettle or tea and coffee facilities inside the room. If you are a spa lover, you should try the spa at Katikies Hotel, massage was really good.   Room Tip: our room is room 37 with a nice view See more room tips",3
"We stayed at Katikies for 1 night to finish off our Santorini trip, having stayed in Fira for 4 nights prior. We wanted a special place to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we certainly got that. On arrival we were given a tour of the property by manager Andreea who was so kind and upgraded us at special request, which really made our trip! The staff are all so attentive and can't do more for you, just 1st class service. Just a stunning hotel with some of the best views. Great to have a choice of pools. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to sample any of the restaurants during our 1 night stay as already had dinner reservation elsewhere, which was a shame because the menu looked great. Superb breakfast buffet though, did not disappoint. We hope to return very soon, and definitely for more than 1 night next time! Pricey but worth every penny to stay here! Just book it! Thanks again to Andreea and your team for making our trip so special :-)Lucy",0
"It was our greatest pleasure to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Katikies. We felt so welcome and touched by everyone we met. Katikies is truly the jewel of Santorini and we will always treasure our time at this hotel. The English translation of Katikies is ""home"" and the staff treated us like family. This is an idyllic place with breathtaking panoramic views and exceptional service. It is in a prime location adjacent to a marbled pedestrian walkway that is close to transportation, restaurants, shopping, and gorgeous sights along the way.We were warmly greeted by George, ambassador for the hotel. He introduced us to Jacqueline Evangelou, hotel manager, and her competent front office staff - Angelica, Sophia, and Anisa. We were offered delicious ginger iced tea and after check in, Sophia escorted us to our impressive suite that included a balcony terrace with mesmerizing sea views. This place is amazing because it has everything going for it . . . best location, beautiful accommodations, elevators for those who want to avoid stairs, and several restaurants on site. They also provide guests with a cell phone to request a taxi or other services when they are away from the hotel. Mornings at Katikies are very special. There is a nice aroma in the air and the sun feels so wonderful. The volcanic rock of the caldera changes color from day-to-day and it is striking to see this beauty. We were seated by the infinity pool for breakfast - an aaah moment!! It is so pleasing to look out at the pool and beyond to the blue/green water of the lagoon. Our servers were Katerina, Rose, Maria, and Lucy. We cannot say enough good things about these highly talented individuals. I also wish to recognize Alexia Charoupa, hotel concierge. Her passion, deep knowledge, and complete willingness to satisfy our requests helped to make our time in Santorini better than we could possibly imagine.We started our breakfast off with freshly squeezed orange juice, cappuccino or delicious Greek coffee. What follows is a gastronomic feast with eggs as you like them and Greek delights to tempt and tantalize your appetite. This is Ambrosia, the food of gods.The food at poolside is outstanding! We also enjoyed Seltz Restaurant and wanted to dine at Mikrasia, their upscale restaurant, but it was booked. Be sure to reserve ahead!My wife and I enjoyed 8 fabulous days at Katikies. This is by far one of our most memorable vacations and we wish to thank everyone at Katikies Hotel for their kindness and extraordinary service. They are very deserving of highest praise!   Room Tip: All rooms have stunning views. We loved Room 2 with close proximity to the heated infinity pool and... See more room tips",1
"A perfect stay!! The property is beyond beautiful, with lovely views from every angle. The rooms are lovely and the three pool options are terrific. Breakfast is delicious too - there's not a single negative thing to say, really. But what really sets Katikies apart is the outstanding service. Everyone from the bellhop to the general manager is extremely helpful and friendly. They anticipated every need with a smile. We will never stay anywhere else in Santorini!",2
"This hotel has a stunning situation, consisting of hotel buildings going down the hillside with wonderful views of the Aegean sea, whose colour changes every day. There are three restaurants, three pools and each of the rooms and suites overlooks the sea. There are a lot of steps (augmented by two lifts), but it is not suitable for the mobility impaired. The first night we dined at Mikrasia, whose chef had spent time at The Fat Duck, and the cuisine certainly showed that and was highly innovative. We arranged a lovely wine tasting at the sister hotel Kirini, which showcases Santorini wines, and was well worth the €85.Where else would you find almost every member of staff (of whom there are many), address you by your name, where there is a towel handed to you when you exit the pool, and where you are handed book markers when reading poolside?? And the excellent Concierge, Alexis, who was more than happy to recommend local restaurants recognizing that guests don't want to eat in every night.Not cheap, but worth every €€   Room Tip: Tell them if you have difficulties with stairs, as some suites are more accessible than others.

"I think the most memorable part for us was the view - over the caldera - from our own personal balcony as well as the delicious breakfasts brought to our 'apartment'. These were brought up by tanned, white-uniformed, Greek Adonises, who balanced the wooden tray with one hand and set it down in front of us without spilling or dislodging our juices, coffees or breakfasts. To top it all they weren't the slightest bit puffed out, considering they'd carried and balanced this up 3 flights. Amazing!My room tip would be if you're not in peak physical condition, request a room as close to street level as possible!!   Room Tip: Unless you're super fit, ask for a room as close to street level as possible. See more room tips",0
"Great location, midway along the pedestrian street. 3 pools, of which the infinity pool is heated, although still chilly in early May! Luxurious, amazing views and attentive staff (had a lady waiting to put a towel around me on getting out of the pool at the champagne bar!!) make the Katikies so popular. Had a fabulous time and would recommend to anyone looking for a busy, upbeat hotel for me I prefer a little quieter, more relaxed ambience.",0
"Absolutely stunning, amazing rooms, amazing service, great food, great location. One of the best luxury hotels we have stayed in. The staff were so friendly and helpful, really felt at home with friends. The views are stunning, very classy hotel",0
"My husband and I are trying to make the most of our time together as a couple before babies/family comes along. Santorini has always been a place that I wanted to visit so we thought it's now or never (or maybe in 20 or so years!). In terms of location you will not find a hotel in a better spot: right at the start of the pedestrian high street. 'Pedestrian high street' is massively under selling. It's a beautiful walk way along the tip of the island. Walking past boutique shops, bars, restaurants on marble slabs with the most stunning views.- anyway, back to the hotel! Katikies doesn't allow young children into the hotel due to steps/hotel is built into a cliff edge etc etc but for me this was a bonus and added to the atmosphere and romance. This hotel is for couples looking for a romantic break and to indulge. They have a champagne bar (French 75 is frighteningly very drinkable!), a spa, 3 pools not to mention the a la carte restaurants they have at your disposal. Service is impeccable. Everyone is extremely helpful, polite and very friendly. Rooms are serviced twice a day with complimentary bottle of water during evening service (when you're out for dinner).Our hotel room (no. 10) was stunning. Given the configuration of the hotel all rooms must have a sea view but we were very lucky as we had a huge terrace with table and chairs, sofa, sunbed and jacuzzi. Having explored the island we certainly felt that Oia is the best place to stay and given the location of our hotel I don't think you could find a better place for pure indulgence and a romantic break",2
"My husband and I stayed at the Katikies in late April. This whitewashed hotel spills down the mountain at the beginning of the pedestrian walkway in Oia. It is a perfect location and the views are magnificent. We were overwhelmed by the wonderful quality of the service, particularly from Alexia the concierge. Also, the breakfast buffet was perhaps the most lavish and inviting of any hotel we've stayed in the world. I would highly recommend the Katikies Hotel. It was also a great value for the money compared to other luxury hotels.   Room Tip: We liked rooms 1 and 2. See more room tips",0
The hotel is best in Santorini and few which offer excellent view of the caldera and sea.The staff are friendly and very helpful and very hard working.. The hotel is friendly for all age groups from young to old..Room amenities are the best and they also provide with an individual mobile phone for every room for emergencies and also have guided tours of the city ..The concierge is one of the best I have seen..Wonderful stay and will definitely stay here again ..The hotel is exactly in oia the main town and on the Main Street so no need for cabs or transfers ..Inspire of being in the main area it's very calm and exquisite..We got a free upgrade and we're staying at one of the most romantic room..Spa and breakfast are excellent !!,0
"We just got back from an absolutely memorable stay in Katikies. All the positive reviews here on Tripadvisor are absolutely true! The customer service is top notch! I wish I can remember all the names of the employees but everyone was very friendly. This trip was 5 years in the making so I have been researching the BEST hotel on tripadvisor and I am so happy with my choice. From the airport pickup, our driver was very courteous and we were picked up by a luxury SUV. He offered us refreshments and was very friendly. When we arrived we were greeted by the porter and he lead us to the reception. At the reception we were given refreshments again. The manager, Jacqueline, welcomed us and gave us a tour of the property. The property itself is stunning and spotless. The location in Oia is very convenient as well because it is located right at the start of the pedestrian walkway. We booked the Senior suite and it was absolutely spacious and clean. The view from our room was breathtaking. Although there were a lot of steps to get to our suite, it was very private and the view was worth it. Breakfast at the main pool was always great! I've never been excited to wake up just for breakfast. Our server, Kate, was always friendly and courteous. The food during breakfast was always great! They had a breakfast buffet and you can also order different types of omelets. . All the servers at the Seltz bar were really hardworking and you can tell that this hotel really emphasizes on customer service. The view from the infinity pool was just stunning!! I could stare at that view for hours. Katikies has one of the best infinity pools in Santorini. They also have 3 pools so you never feel crowded. Katikies is indeed a luxury property with the BEST customer service. I had issues with the suite during our stay, like the bathroom trash can won't open properly and housekeeping didn't replace my facial tissue BUT they were able to fix this right away. Again, I cannot emphasize on how good customer service here is.We also ordered room service on a couple of nights and the food and presentation was always great! I have major respect for the waiters who carry those food trays gracefully despite the number of steps they have to go through!Katikies will be my one and only choice in Santorini. My husband and I will always remember our stay in this magical place.   Room Tip: All suites are great See more room tips",3
Amongst the best hotels we have been - absolutely great location with breathtaking view - very well managed with oustanding service - gourmet breakfast - high class and just perfect in everything - made our short stay in Santorini to a unforgetable experience,1
"The Katikies Hotel experience was amazing from the time we booked through Trip Advisor through the time we left the island via ferry for Mykonos. Immediately receiving a personalized email welcoming us, I knew that we were in the right hands. Sophia, Jacqueline, Georgio, Alexia, and others were truly welcoming and created a special experience that will stay with us forever. The location is prime - at the beginning of the Oia marble-paved walkway - all the better to meander toward the unbelievable sunset views. Our gorgeous white-washed room provided us much needed sanctuary and serenity after an extremely hectic year. We will be back.   Room Tip: Ask for a room toward the lower side of the hotel if you would like a quiet experience. See more room tips",0
"The Katities Hotel has the perfect location at the beginning of the pedestrianised street in picturesque Oia - the views blew us away and we felt relaxed within minutes of arriving. Completely secluded but minutes from beautiful shops, cafes and restaurants. The rooms are clean, fresh and predominantly white with the most unbelievably comfortable beds for an amazing nights sleep. The staff at the hotel were all fantastic - charming, helpful, always on hand to help without being obtrusive. My 'Sun Touch' spa treatment was perfection (booking in advance advised). Three different restaurants offer different dining experiences with different views overlooking infinity pools and the breakfast offers anything you could want for. The concierge had great recommendations for excursions and restaurants, we returned each evening for expertly made cocktails made to your taste back at the hotel champagne bar. We loved our stay so much we rebooked for the same weekend for next year before we left. Early May has less tourists and a perfect temperature for us of around 25 degrees during the day. Thoroughly recommended.",2
"Perfect view, perfect hotel, perfect staff, perfect room. Everything about this place exudes perfection from the perfectly painted white walls to the neat touches of the interior design. Great location at the very beginning of the walk in Oia.",0
"we stayed at Katikies early April. We got in around noon, unfortunately our room was not yet available. So we walked around the quaint village. When we came back Sophia took us to our room. We had booked a senior suite. Unfortunately our suite had a loft which we did not like. My husband, daughter and I both kept hitting our head. So I went to speak to Sophia. She said that although they did not have any other room available that day, she would be able to move us the next day to another room, which she did. We moved into their honeymoon suite which was awesome. It had its own jacuzzi and the room was very large and private. Though it had a lot more steps.On the last day we had a late evening flight but the hotel staff told us that we would use the facilities and continue to have access to the Wifi ....so we spent a few hours in the restaurant area enjoying the view. Though the hotel is very expensive, it was a great visit. Would recommend it.",0
"We knew our experience at Katikies was going to be special from the moment we checked in. Greeted with a cocktail by the friendly hotel manager, we got a tour of the property and escorted to our junior suite. The views are stunning from the Katikies! A bottle of wine and a bowl of fruit welcomed us to the room and our luggage was promptly delivered. The staff (Jacqueline, Sophia, Alexia, Maria, etc.) were amazing in every way. Very friendly, attentive and always had a smile on their faces. The breakfast buffet was top notch and the restaurants for dinner were equally as special. I highly recommend the Katikies Hotel if you truly want luxurious accommodations and service.",1
A perfect hotel with one of the greatest views.A friendly efficient and very thorough welcome and a tour of the hotel starts your stay off superbly. Our room had the most wonderful balcony and private pool.We booked this hotel because of the infinity pool and whatever the pictures show the actual experience easily exceeds expectationAll the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and make the whole stay a true pleasure and delight,0
"From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left, Katikes Hotel in Oia delivered the most consistent professionalism and service I have experienced this far. From the guided tour of the entire property by the hotels GM with an introduction to the head chef along with the F&B manger, to the personal and warm greeting each and every staff member gave everyday truly made me believe we were staying at Santorini's best address. The location is the easiest to get to out of all of the hotels in Oia. Once exiting the taxi, we were met by Katikies staff, greeting us by name, and only too willing to collect our bags and carry them to check in. We had friends staying at Charisma Suites and they had to drag all their bags through the maze of tiny paths to find their accommodation, once they found it, had to carry them down 6 flights of Santorini stairs (which isn't easy without bags) . We were made to feel like a guest, and though I was advised the hotel was at full capacity during a point at our 7 day stay, it really felt like there were only a handful of guests were staying there with they way we were waited on hand and foot. 5 Stars is not a high enough rating for this truly Luxury Hotel. I can assure anyone research a Santorini stay that you will not be disappointed with Katikies Hotel.Congratulations team Katikies for an exemplary effort and thank you for making our stay truly unforgettable.",1
"We stayed in three hotels while on Santorini, and this one was our favorite because of the perfect location, amazing pools, delicious food, and impeccable service. From the moment we arrived, the staff took wonderful care of us, offering us a welcome drink, taking us on a tour of the property, and explaining the amenities in our room. Our room (we had a junior suite but were upgraded) was fantastic; we had a huge bathroom and plenty of space downstairs to relax, in additional to a fabulous balcony with a large lounger. The pools are incredible; we could spend all day sitting in them staring at the incredible view. When we got out, staff always made sure we had a fresh towel to dry off, and you could order great (albeit expensive) drinks and snacks from the comfort of your lounger. We splurged on dinner at Mikrasia one night; our only complaint was that there was far too much food. Our favorite part of the meal was the selection of all the delicious and interesting small plates at the beginning. All in all it was a magical stay, perfect for a couples getaway, and we can't wait to return.",1
"My wife and I stayed here in room 37 for four nights in April of 2016. The hotel provided experiences unlike any other we've come across in neraly twenty years of traveling the globe together. The views are breathtaking, each room is a suite of unique design that entices you to never want to leave, the location is ideal for exploring the quaint village of Oia, the rates are competitive and represent good value, and the sea view breakfast included with each booking is truly outstanding. There are three lovely pools here as well as a number of restaurants that will leave your taste buds in awe. What really makes this hotel such a grand experience however is the incredible staff that go out of their to provide exceptional service to each and every guest. When the sad day comes that you have to leave you will undoubtedly feel as though you are leaving behind a number of new friends. In short, the management and staff of this hotel are world class and they will do everything in their power to assure you of a travel experience that you will never forget!",1
"This hotel is a dream in a dream location. It is worth every star! From the moment we arrived (early) we were greeted with a delicious ginger lemonade and many smiles.The room had a magnificent view, the food was out of this world, the people just made everything stand out more. I can't wait to visit again!!",0
"Absolutely amazing from the start!Staff unbelievably friendly & professional!We were greeted by the administrators that gave us some refreshments, the valet boy parked our rental car, so no headache of trying to figure it out where to park it & manager of the hotel (beautiful woman too) gave us a tour around the hotel & introduce us to almost everyone in the hotel.On our arrival, we had a bottle of wine (welcome drinks) & fruits.Good wine, too! :)We stayed in Senior suite - spacious, modern. Loved it!Restaurant - great! Location - great! Hotel - amazing!Not to mention breakfast in room! Amazing!Loved every single hour of our stay!Would absolutely recommend it to all & will definitely come back to this hotel! (ONLY to this hotel while in Santorini)   Room Tip: Suites were great! I would recommend the senior suites! See more room tips",0
"I have stayed in this Hotel from 3-6th April 2016 and the experience was just mesmerizing.Just on landing I got a surprise at the hotel front desk that I was upgraded to the superior room and i cannot thank the Katikies team enough for their kind gesture.This Hotel is located startegically on Oia and has very nice views of caldera that just cannot be compared.The amenities in the hotel just take you to the ride in a dreamworld.The most striking feature of this hotel is their Hospitality.The entire staff will just make sure that the wish of their guests is fulfilled.They also offer you a cellular device in case you are lost and a call to the hotel reception will provide the necessary support on your way.The magical views of caldera from the white washed suites are just uncompromising and you will be in awe till the time you are there.The infinity pools are just mindblowing and take you to a trip to the dreamland.Rooms and suites have classic Santorini white-washed walls with Greek antiques, as well as modern days BOSE docking stations and 24-hour room service. Superior suites, have a private balcony with spectacular views.Surreal! Katakies @ Oia Santorini ' is fascinating beyond words. Luxury breaks boundaries here. Enchanting Views, Glistening Waters,, Infinity pools, Warm Jacuzzis ...spill down the cliffs of magical Caldera. Truely living to the reputation of GRANDE DAME OF CALDERA LUXURY HOTELS.This has been my best trip ever and I owe all to Katikies team to make my vacation memorable.I still dream of this place and wish to be there every time i plan a greece trip.",0
This has got to be one of the most wonderful and magical places I have ever stayed at. We stayed here for two nights right at the start of the season (think we were guests number three and four this year!) and it was such a joy and so relaxing. The setting of the hotel is stunning with amazing views wherever you go. We got a free upgrade to a suite room which was faultless and top notch with so much style and so so comfortable! The hotel has three public pools which are all very idyllic and a couple of bars/restaurants. All drinks we had were delicious and served by the most polite and smiling staff. Breakfast was awesome with a lot of variety and tables overlooking the sea. It was so nice to relax at this place and service was so forthcoming. The staff say they'll arrange for anything you want and I believe them - people at Katikies are really focused on making your stay memorable and perfect. I can't find enough superlatives for this place and will surely be back in this little piece of paradise! Would give 10 stars if possible! Such a great luxury experience.,1
"The most luxurious hotel I've stayed at. The views, the pool, the staff, and the location is amazing. The hotel is absolutely stunning! The staff was amazing. This was our first time in Santorini, and we didn't want to leave.",2
"Amazing hotel!We choose this place to stay during our honey moon trip. It was way beyond my expectations. An extraordinary experience. All the staff were very nice and supportive. They try to help us in every single thing to make our stay perfect. The room was superb, really beautiful decor and stunning view.The breakfast in bed was really good and special. It worth every penny.",1
"We only spent one night at this hotel. It has three swimming pool and elevators which run up and down. Very delicate decoration and design, the staffs were very friendly. The ocean and volcano view is stunning, it is just like heaven. Various choices at breakfast, and the restaurant has great view as well. It is one of the best hotel at Santorini, and a luxury choice as well",4
"Stunning white deco, beautiful rooms and impeccable surface. The views are magnificent and the breakfast in bed concept is so special. Loved this place and would definitely recommend for any travelling couple!",1
This hotel is beyond amazing in every way. The welcome drink during check in was a nice touch on a hot hot day. We had a beautiful room with stunning view. I now realized that a lot of pictures of Santorini in travel magazines were of the Katikies Hotel. We ordered room service a few time and the food was some of the best meals we've had in Santorini. We also ordered a pool side snack and the food was amazing there as well. I love having breakfast every morning overlooking the Caldera. The sunset from our room was breathtakingly beautiful. This place left me speechless. It was a sad sad day when we had to leave.,2
"I truly can’t say enough about my husband and I’s honeymoon experience at Katikies. Overall it was the most truly memorable, idyllic stay I’ve ever had; far surpassing all of our expectations. We dream about this place often and cannot WAIT to return one day!We arrived in Santorini later than scheduled due to airline delays, and since we had prearranged transportation with the hotel from the airport to Katikies, we tried to get in touch to let them know about the delay. When we arrived, we were pleased to have the most personable, charming driver take our stuff and offer us water as he drove us to Katikies. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted with warmth by the entire staff, who offered us a delicious “welcome” drink and took us to our room to sleep (but not without having the already closed kitchen bring us some sandwiches first!). Our room was beautiful—idyllic Greek Island white, pristine walls and decor, but extremely elegant and modern at the same time. We knew that the room would be beautiful, but were not expecting something so exquisite (bonus: they upgraded us to a Superior Suite which was two floors and beautiful). Every morning we enjoyed the absolutely stunning views from the pool area that looked out onto the Mediterranean Sea and also offered a classic view of the town. The pools were small and would fill up fast, but if you didn’t get a spot poolside right away, there was always somewhere else to go with equally stunning (or better views) while you waited. Most of our days were spent lounging by the pool, except for one day we walked into town and down to the port. And two other days, we went for a half day catamaran sail—which was also amazing, and deserves its own separate review. Service at the hotel was impeccable. It seemed they found staff that truly loved their jobs and found pleasure in making conversation with guests and making guests feel welcomed and comfortable. Finally, the food was absolutely delicious. Every restaurant had a different take on Greek food, and were all equally amazing (from morning breakfast/brunch to poolside lunch and dinners. We did make a reservation for a wine tasting and dinner at MIKRASIA, which was probably the best meal we had while in Greece—just incredible.I truly can’t say enough good words about our experience at Katikies, and only wish to one day return for many anniversaries to come!",3
"We stayed for three nights in the Katikies hotel Santorini in October 2015. It was my partner's birthday and I booked him Santorini and the Katikies as a treat to celebrate his birthday ... and a treat it was. We had a an amazing suite with a breathtaking view and our own heated pool. Frankly we had to drag ourselves out of the room to enjoy the rest of Santorini and we would have been happy spending the three days in our room, relaxing and switching off from the rest of the world in this spot of paradise. The hotel in itself is amazing, all in simple and tasteful Cycladic white, but I can argue that I have been to comparable hotels around the world. What made our stay particularly special was the attention to detail that the dedicated staff, from the General Manager, Alejandro Rueda to the most junior member, paid to ensure that our stay is memorable. We would definitely go there again!",3
"Such a wonderful, relaxing place! The service was amazing from the start 'till checkout.The staff were friendly, helpful & cheerful.. We were pampered and spoiled beyond belief.The food is fantastic & the view was breathtaking..The hotel is simply stunning & I will definitely stay there again on my next visit to Santorini.",3
What a wonderful place! The service was amazing. The rooms made you feel like you were living in a luxurious cave. The food is fantastic. We were pampered and spoiled beyond belief. The hotel is simply stunning! We could not stop taking pictures. The views are breath taking. The location is great. Close to all the restaurants and shops.   Room Tip: Avoid rooms high up as tourists come into the hotel to take pictures. Rooms lower down have private... See more room tips,2
My family and I spent a few days at the Katikies and we had an amazing experience! The staff were so incredibly friendly and helpful and gave us great tips of things to do on the island. The hotel was GORGEOUS and every morning I would have an amazing view of the clear sea. I highly recommend staying here!!,4
"To enjoy sunrise and sunset in Santorini, Oia is one of the best place you should consider. However, Katikies Hotel is the ONE and ONLY choice in Oia. With great food, warm swimming pool, incredible cliff view, and cozy market street near by, Katikies Hotel become unique and perfect. My wife and I surprised by their considerable service because we just mentioned ""honeymoon trip"" in lobby, they upgraded us to Honeymoon Suite with fruit and champaign in the room. We had wonderful image and memory in Santorini, and Katikies made it better.",0
"The location is perfect and close to everything whether you want to shop, eat, drink, dance, and etc. Complimentary breakfast on every floor is great. The bed is cozy and comfortable - I slept like a baby each night of my stay. Each room also comes with a bathrobe which is also nice. it was a great hotel and I would stay here again...",1
"When I booked the hotel I had read that it was the best hotel on the island and even Greece (some sites even said number 1 in Europe). Usually when reading these things I get a little skeptical, but thought I’d give them a try anyway. After having stayed there, I can say that it’s a great place to stay and may very well be the best hotel in Greece (best I’ve been to anyways). The accommodation and facilities (pools, restaurants, etc) are great, but what really makes this hotel special is the level of service you receive. They even give you a cell phone to use while there to call with anything you need while you’re out. Need a pickup at the beach on the other side of the island? They’ll organize it right away. Need a restaurant recommendation? They’re always around to help. It’s really the service that makes this place stand out. The hotel specifics are already well documented in the other great reviews, but I just thought I’d put this out there in case anyone who’s skeptical like me when they see “best in Greece” is reading. It lives up",1
"If you're like me, you have all these options you're trying to narrow down and pick the perfect hotel for your trip to Santorini. Look no further. The Katikies Hotel in Oia is far an away the most luxurious, friendly, and service focused resort on the caldera. My wife and I spent the last half of our honeymoon there, and there isn't a single thing that the Katikies could have done better. Perfectly situated at the beginning of the pedestrian walkway in Oia, check in is comfortable and seamless with one of the managers helping you throughout the process. After a quick tour of the property on the way to your room, you'll already feel at home. Thank you to the Assistant Manager, who upgraded us from the Honeymoon Suite that we booked to the hotel's most private room the Master Suite complete with it's own terrace and plunge pool. You can easily walk from the hotel all the way along the pedestrian walkway for restaurants, cafes, bakeries, bars, shops, etc... and it will only take you about 20 minutes.The infinity pools offer stunning views and picturesque surroundings that everyone associates with Santorini. The resort never feels crowded as there is ample room for everyone in the public areas even though the hotel was at full capacity. Breakfast can be served directly to your private terrace or you can join the other guests at the buffet, you can't go wrong with either option. Staff and guests included were so friendly and sociable, it really felt like being home.After lounging by the pool, if you want to get out and see Santorini or make reservations for basically any and everything, Margarita at the concierge has all the connections for the island and will get you to the top of the list with the best available rates and seats. She helped us book all of our sunset drinks and dinners as well as an impromptu surprise helicopter tour of the island I wanted for my wife.We had a private sunset dinner organized at the hotel for our final night with an incredible set menu that I was allowed to tweak based on our food preferences. Our own private server, Stefanos, added to our magical evening with his stories of his experiences on the island. This hotel is the only option you need to think about, so go ahead and book with confidence and start thinking about how you're going to spend your days once you get there!Instagram: WiFiConnectedWorld   Room Tip: The entrance to the hotel is high up on the cliff, right off the walkway.

"Couples , lovers, and friends beware! You may find hard to comply with this kind of hotel! If you are not used to be royal pampered or fulfill your wishes during your stay then you have a problem!Staff all day discreet around you to come up with whatever your heart desires. Restaurant and breakfast tailor made to your needs. Slippers and newspapers of any kind and the list goes on. All this wrapped in a breathtaking sunset will ensure unforgettable stay. Don't get me wrong but if you touch perfect you don't have to be scrumptious.",5
"my brother in law chose this hotel based on opinions of his friends. So glad he did. We were upgraded at check in and our rooms were over the top! We had large suites with the most incredible views!!, all amenities were beyond our expectations. The staff was the friendliest we have ever had anywhere we have traveled. They were attentive but not obtrusive. It's definitely a 5 star facility. Our food at each restaurant was delicious. We could not find one negative (other than all the steps, which is typical in all of Oia). The managers and the front desk made sure we knew they and all their staff was there to make our stay the best ever, and they succeeded! Thank you to each of them. We will definitely return to Santorini and not consider anywhere else but the Katikes!,",0
"Lovely hotel, stunning views, attentive service, cool, relaxed vibe, but high end with style. Three pools, the two main ones with superb views, as with most of the rooms also. The hotel rooms are stark and white, which is characteristic of the Greek Islands. The pool bar plays groovy tunes, while you dip in it's warm waters with dreamy views & champagne for breakfast. Staff are very obliging & the food is actually pretty good that you may consider just staying here and not venturing out for any reason. Fabulous stay. It should be noted that there are many, many stairs to get around from the road to rooms to pool, not for anyone with walking issues. Would certainly return.",0
"Katikies is an incredibly stunning property that offers magnificent views of the Caldera and picturesque Oia. One of the most important aspects of choosing a hotel is location, and Katikies certainly was the ultimate choice in this regard. The hotel's minimalistic architecture, fitting with the surroundings, ensured ultimate relaxation and luxury.Our lovely room was spacious with incredible views from our private terrace. The breakfast was outstanding, in choice and flavour. The food and the fantastic service at the restaurants and the pools was absolutely top class. Oia and Katikies felt incredibly luxurious almost unreal somehow. If we have an opportunity to return to Oia we would love to return to this remarkable hotel.",0
"We stayed here and this was one of my best experiences ... We were offered a free upgrade on the room with a complimentary bottle of white Wine on our arrival .. Loved the views and no comparison for the views from the infinity pools .. Would visit again .. We could not try the food, except for the breakfast which was fantastic , as we were doing a lot of stuff on the Island ( Quadbike , Sunset Cruises , Car Rentals, beaches etc ...) Staff is very helpful and they offer awesome services like rentals and take care of your each and every request .. we were also given breakfast on our 5 am early departure ..Would visit again as this is also ideally located near the road where Taxi drops you.. so no walking for ages before you get to your hotel ..",0
"I have just come back from a 4 days/3nights stay at Katikies Hotel in Oia and no words can describe my satisfaction. The Hotel and its view are just as excellent if not better than the photos posted. The service was definitely amazing, the personnel is very friendly...and most importantly present at all times :) makes you feel like part of a big happy family :)it's definitely the best hotel I have ever been too...knowing that I am someone who travels a lot for work and pleasure..

"Excellent hotel in every way. Stunning views, good location and great dining facilities. Above all the care and attention to detail of the staff in the restaurants and around the pool was exemplary.The rooms were novel being carved out of the rock but well equipped, light and airy with spacious terraces.",0
"So I'm actually writing this review from the hotel - I don't leave for another day. But, I wanted to make sure I wrote about it before I got back to real life and got too busy...it's that good.Let me start by saying that I take hotel reviews with a grain of salt, since everyone has different standards. Someone who only stays in budget hotels might rate a Holiday Inn with 5 stars, where someone like me (who is a certified hotel snob), would rather sleep in her car than in a Holiday Inn. That said, Katikies is absolutely 5 stars.Once I knew I was going to Santorini, I debated for over 2 days about where to stay. Let me save you the trouble: BOOK THIS HOTEL. Here's the rundown:1) The location: Absolutely, incredibly stunning. The views are beyond exquisite. I have numerous friends who have been to Santorini, and after seeing my pictures told me I have the best views they've seen from a hotel. Close to lots of shops and nightlife if you feel like going out, and the island itself is quite small so you can really get anywhere you ant to very easily.2) The hotel grounds: Perfection. There are 3 pools, all infinity pools. One is heated, but I spent my time at the un-heated pools and they felt amazing. No pool was overly crowded, and the smallest one (but the one with the best view) has yet to have a single person there during my stay so far, so it's like having my own private pool. There are numerous other places to sit/lounge/sunbathe on the property, so it's very easy to get a secluded spot -- and virtually everywhere has a stunning, stunning view. The whole property is very clean and feels very authentically Greek.3) The food: Delicious. There is one restaurant dedicated to champagne drinks and small/lighter bites that pair well with champagne (like sashimi) -- all very fresh, very good. The larher restaurant has a larger menu, and everything I ate was fantastic (Greek salad with chicken, Chicken tandoori, salmon, breakfast cakes, sashimi, calamari). The main restaurant - where you have to make reservations - is supposed to be fantastic, but because this was a solo trip, I never ate there. Room service is prompt, and eating on your terrace is perfection, especially breakfast. Drinks are AMAZING ... from the super-tasty iced coffees and hot cappuccinos, to the extensive cocktail menu (do yourself a favor and order the Mexican Butterfly at least once. Trust me).4) The service: I love love love the staff here! They are never, ever in your way, but the minute I ever wanted anything someone was right there. They're friendly, accommodating, helpful ... I just love them.5) The spa: I got the Chill Out massage and St. Barth Pureness facial at the A. Spa, which is actually at their sister hotel just down the road (5 minute walk). It sounded like a pain to have to walk next door (I told you, I'm a baby with hotels), but it was totally fine and a good excuse to leave the property. Anyway, the spa is beautiful and very private. You get some time in this amazing heated indoor pool before your treatment -- they closed all the doors for me since I didn't bring a bathing suit, and I had complete privacy to float around. The services were top notch -- I get massages and facials regularly in top spas in LA, and this massage might have been the best I've ever had. She used super-smooth seashells filled with hot oil ... I mean ... just do it. Don't be cheap. Just do it.6) The rooms: OK, I almost posted the review without talking about the rooms! That's usually the ONLY thing I talk about in reviews, but you're really never in them at this place so I wasn't even thinking about it. Anyway, I stayed in their lowliest room (a standard), and it was perfectly nice. Small and relatively basic, but clean, bright and sunny, light wood floors, very comfy bed and good bedding. Bathroom OK but no complaints (keep in mind that I'm very hard on hotel bathrooms). The room had a small, furnished terrace with, as always, an INCREDIBLE view. I'll probably upgrade my room next time, but the regular ones will still do the trick, promise.Overall -- if you're considering staying here, stop thinking about it and book it! I'm already planning my next trip (but this time I'm forcing my boyfriend to come!) With a friend, with your partner or by yourself (like I did)...there is no way this hotel can disappoint.",4
"Arguably the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed! As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by reception Maria, she is super nice, she showed us around and our upgraded room. ( room 32 is wonderful, private patio, infinity pool and jacuzzi are both one floor below, away from the other two infinity pools which are more crowded )The view from the hotel is breathtaking, I can just sit there for hours doing nothing but enjoying the sea and caldera view.The service is extraordinary from every single member of staff, I can't fault anything. I know the price is a bit expensive but for what you can get, it is totally worth it.   Room Tip: Room 32, superior room!!! See more room tips",0
"This property is gorgeous! Our room, with a little patio outside, was perfect. The pool areas were staffed by amazingly attentive people... We felt spoiled rotten. Breakfast was superb. The views are unsurpassed. Do stay here, if only for a day or two ($$$$)...",0
"My HAPPY PLACE, this hotel is my happy place :) i cant but put a smile when i remember my time there. we have spent our honeymoon in 2010 in Katikies Hotel and all we talked about for the last five years was the perfection of this hotel, that's why we went back there again last August to celebrate our 5th anniversary. The hotel was perfect is 2010 and got even better this year.No words could describe it; the view (the best in this world), the location, the rooms, the infinity pools, the ambiance, the food (plsss eat the burger yum yum yum), everything is beyond marvelous. The cherry on the top is the manager and the staff who know us by name and put a human touch to this heavenly place.Oia is beautiful but you don't have to leave the hotel if you stay in Katikies, you can stay hours on your private terrace sipping champagne while enjoying the view of the caldera. This is a piece of heaven for a dream vacation away from the stress of life. I cant wait to go there again and again and again :))))",0
"This hotel is wonderful, with beautiful views and stunning rooms, the pool is great and the staff are delightful. We had a really amazing holiday, we weren't there for long, but it really was the highlight of our trip. I would highly recommend.",0
Everything was perfect from the service to the location of the hotel . Makis a drivers who works at the hotel was really helpful and all his recommendations were great. We had an amazing time partly thanks to him.I strongly recommend this place !,0
Luxurious accommodation. Magical views. Exceptional customer service. Delicious food. My wife and I have stayed at five star accommodation all over the world. Santorinis secret has been the best hotel of the lot. We will return next year.Highly recommended.Also staff whilst they speak English and Greek are also multilingual and cater for special requirements.,0
"Santorini Secret is a perfect place to experience everything that makes the island of Santorini special. It is conveniently located near restaurants and shops in the heart of Oia, and has breath-taking views of the Aegean Sea. This hotel also has oversized rooms with private balconies where breakfast is delivered for private dining each morning. The only reason I didn't give this hotel five stars is that the beds which don't have box springs are a little hard. Also, the air conditioner only cooled the sitting area right in front of it, which meant the bedroom and bathroom areas tended to be too warm.   Room Tip: If you can avoid it, don't travel to Santorini in July or August. It's very hot and crowded... See more room tips",1
"My wife and I were forced to postpone our honeymoon at the last minute at the end of June, because of the unexpected passing of her father, less than a week after we got married. Fortunately we were able to re-schedule it, and will be staying from August 15th through August 19th, 2016. Santorini Secret's staff was very helpful, understanding, and completely compassionate toward our situation, giving us a full credit on our stay to use at a future date. The manager went as far as to offer us an upgraded pool suite room complementary, contingent upon availability at check in. Although we may not receive the upgrade, due to availability, I thought it should be noted that Santorini Secret is a five star hotel, that treats their customers with respect and understanding through a difficult time for our family. We are looking forward to our arrival at your beautiful resort next week.. Mr. J. Coll Mrs. D. Traina",0
"Honestly, it's quite overwhelming looking for a hotel in Oia. They're all pricey, they all have great views, and I'm sure the service outstanding at all of them. Luckily, we found the sweet spot. Not going to lie, it's not cheap...but it's not as expensive as Oia could be. First and foremost, the staff: Exceptional. Real top notch, beyond 5 star treatment. Mind you, this is Santorini, there are no mega resorts. Don't expect to find a gym or 4 different restaurants. What you do get? a beautiful, cavernous room, and of course, AMAZING caldera views from your room and lana'i/porch. The breakfast is included every day and it's heavenly. The avocado, cucumber and tomato salad is divine. The best part: Take a tour with Makis. If you arrange a private airport pickup, he'll most likely be the guy picking you up but he is one of the few, TRUE Santorini locals. He grew up and spent all his life on the island (save for his military duty). He can give you insights and tell you history about the island like no one else could (as a seasonal destination, many people come to the island from other places and leave). If I could say one more thing about the place is that the pool area is small, but quaint.   Room Tip: they're all good. room 20 especially has a large terrace. See more room tips",1
"We did not stay here, but whenever a person makes a difference in your trip is always a treasure. The hotel director in this case might be the best there is on the island. Your stay will be worth every penny for the hospitality, view, location and facilities of this hotel. Congratulations!",2
"It's the perfect place to be , the service is over 7 stars it's amazing the staff is so friendly and the stay is a real different experience , we loved it , the rooms are amazing , breakfast display and service is like nothing I have seen before , they even pack for you your breakfast of you have early flight and leaving early to a flight or shore excursion , nothing they can do more to improve anything it's already more than perfect !!! We love you team ;)",2
"This was our first trip to Santorini and it couldn't have gone better. The staff was fantastic, so friendly and so beyond helpful. They were eager to offer recommendations for travelers as well as hidden locations off the beaten path. They helped us book, and cancel, different reservations and activities throughout the week and constantly greeted us with a smile.The views are absolutely perfect. Delicious complimentary breakfast delivered to our porch at whatever time we requested every morning. An incredible spot to enjoy coffee and look out over the cliffs. The location is ideal, right by the main drag yet not overwhelmed by people. Can't recommend it highly enough!",1
Dont ever think twice abt this wonderful home! Well its more thn a home! Uwill never find a staff better thn the people who work here! We got spoiled! They r so kind and generous! When they knew its our anniversary they brought us cake and Champagne to celebrate it with us! They are out of this world . Wonderful place amazing people and best service and food.we r going to come again and again without hesitating ! Where can we find anorher Mano and louisa!!! Best managers everrr we love u and thanks for the precious moments,1
"My first time here in this hotel and I am amaze! The view of the ocean and the breeze can't use any words to describe. Just come and visit this hotel. The infinity pool is just amazing! I still can't believe that I'm back home! I thought my home has the infinity pool right now (gosh how embarrassing when you have family around) The hotel room and bed is very comfortable and you can just open the widow and chill in the room for guys. Because that's what I did. Just mindful about the air conditioning as if is turn on for long period the water will tend to leak and you have be careful not to fall as the floor could be slippery. You have to had the hotel breakfast and if possible choose all! Except for the cereal probably I'm Asian, but I do think is not worth it to order the cereal. Still great breakfast! I want to go back!!!!!",1
"From the time our driver met us at the airport to the time we settled in our room, we didn't stop smiling. The staff is so nice and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and the view spectacular. We got the room with the hot tub which is amazing. Depending on your preference, you may want to splurge for the one with the pool although our actual room is nicer than the one we saw with the pool. The breakfast they serve in your semi-private balcony was amazing and so romantic. Make sure you book on their site to get the hotel transfers and taxes included in your price.",1
"Best views and service and good recommendations of restaurants and activities to do. It is located in the most beautiful zone of Santorini. We haven't had a lot of time but thanks them the experience has been amazing!! 100% recommended! I recommend also the restaurants, it is delicious!",0
"Since the first day, the manager of the hotel Louiza took care of us, and I just can say good thing about her. This hotel surpassed my expectations; the room was great, the views were breathtaking (probably the best views we saw in santorini), the service was excellent and they always received us with a smile. And the village where the Secrets is located is probably the nicest one on the island !!! I really recomend it to couples.",1
Celebrating our first anniversary in Santorini and stayed at Secret during our trip. Everything about this hotel is perfect. Great staffs! everyone makes sure you have a comfortable stay and enjoy your time. Complimentary room upgrade and free welcome drink by the bar. Louiza (manager) and Manos (bartender) are the ones you need to talk to ;),2
It's been 14 years of our marriage. Yes we are.. Our most romantic & relaxed stay at the Santorini Secret (Small Luxury Hotels of the World) which all seemed to be tailor made has only made our bonding stronger.. A must do property... Of course the credit also goes to all the staff for their quality and timely services and never the less the location of the property to top it all..,0
The views and service are unparalleled. My only suggestion is that you not mind climbing stairs. My husband has a little arthritis and our room was further from the entrance so he had a tiny bit of trouble with the 100 steps. He still said he would do it all over again. Pictures just won't do justice to the view. It looks great in pictures but it is even more breathtaking in person. The restaurant -Black Rock alone is almost worth the trip. The staff is very friendly We love it here,1
"I honestly cannot say enough good about this amazing hotel. Located in picturesque Oia, this is the ultimate place for you and your lovaaa! With surreal views of the sea, superb room service, kind and helpful staff, and comfortable and gorgeous rooms, you will feel completely spoiled. Just perfect!",0
"We stayed there for 4 nights... This lovely boutique hotel is really special! The rooms are spacious and premium. View is stunning on the caldera. Hotel location is perfect. Breakfast is served in the room and is really delicious. Staff is friendly and welcoming: the people at the reception are very nice and make your stay even more enjoyable, with a customizd and personalized concierge type of service. They booked all our activities outside the hotel (sunset boat trip, dinners in great restaurant choices, water sports, car &atv rentals) - basically everything! and excellent recommendations all in all. The hotel has an infinity pool and a tasty restaurant for dine-in called black rock. The guy managing the pool and the restaurant - Manos - is really friendly and reliable. Few points to be aware of: Hotel has lots of stairs but this is the case of most hotels in Oia. Wifi in the rooms is a bit slow. Finally, the price you pay is relatively on the high side but this hotel is really worth every penny!",1
"From the moment we entered the property, the graciousness and attentiveness of the staff was amazing. We were greeted with a mango cocktail that was truly one of the best cocktails I have ever had. We continued to order them throughout our stay. Manos Kritikos, the F&B manager, went above and beyond to make our initial moment at the hotel until our goodbyes the most memorable experiences we have ever had at a hotel. Additionally, ALL members of the hotel staff were extraordinary.Our room was large, clean, welcoming. We had an extraordinary view along with an infinity pool. Breakfast of our choice was served daily directly on our patio, on-time and delicious. We loved this hotel and the staff so much we stayed an extra day. We were a family of six, requiring three rooms, and the staff made it seamless.If you have the time, ask Manos about setting you up on a sunset yacht tour. It was one of the top three best experiences of our trip. That is saying a lot, as we had many exceptional experiences.All of the rooms overlook the sea. There is not a bad view from any part of this hotel. Tourists stop at the exact location of this hotel to take pictures of the sea and the iconic architecture around it.   Room Tip: There is not a single bad room. Every room has an extraordinary view. See more room tips",1
"We wanted to stay at the famous Katikies but they were fully booked. So I did some research and decided to book a room at Santorini Secrets as they had good reviews and pictures of the infinity pool looked gorgeous.This place did not disappoint ! Service was wonderful, courteous and helpful - from the Porter to the reception to the pool staff. All rooms have wonderful views of the Mediterranean Sea and the hill slope view of white buildings that Santorini is famous for. Location is good and near all the shops and yet is on the quieter side and wider part of the walkway. Every room has its own jacuzzi or pool and rooms are large and spacious with a comfortable bed. Breakfast can be served at your room balcony - generous servings of food which you pick and choose during check in. A stay would not be complete without a dip in the infinity pool which is one of the best in Santorini as it is really by the edge of the cliff - chilling out as you watch the world go by. I would give Santorini Secret as major thumbs up !",0
"Amazing hotel worth every $$. Private pool and cave rooms, stunning hotel. Just like the pictures you see of Santorini ! We walked in to enquire if any room were free as our original accommodation was no good. From there on Santorini Secret took amazing care of us, sending someone to help carry our luggage from our bad hotel to there amazing hotel, gave us free massages on arrival, welcome cocktail and a tour of the property. The staff are lovely they take great care in their jobs. Even offering yoghurt for my bad sunburn and aloe vera from the spa. The bar staff love to chat and make you feel welcome, Leo makes fantastic cocktails! The breakfast options are endless and all delicious. The restaurant food is mouth watering. Highly recommend Santorini Secret. Only place we would stay if we are lucky enough to go back.",0
"As a two-time Santorini Secret guest, all I can say is that it is the only place to stay on the island, as far as I'm concerned! The hotel itself, and its rooms and views, are fantastic but what really completes the experience is its staff--especially Manos. Manos goes above and BEYOND to ensure that each guest has the perfect Santorini experience--from recommending the best attractions on the island, to putting together boat charters, winery experiences, and more. He truly acts as a personal concierge and is SO much more than what you would expect from an average manager. Black Rock, Santorini Secret's new restaurant, has quickly become one of the top restaurants on the island. Its Greek cuisine with a modern twist, is absolutely delicious! With spectacular views and top service, Black Rock and its staff are truly unparalleled. From a lovely dinner evening at the restaurant, to a serene lunch by the pool, Black Rock's menu offers it all. Of course, no review for the Secret would be complete without mentioning the breakfast. The offerings are absolutely endless and every dish is insane! Panos is a key component here, ensuring that all guests are taken care of each morning.Manos has done a phenomenal job of not only creating the food menus for Black Rock and the hotel, but the wine & spirits list as well. Offering both local Greek wines/beers and artisan cocktails, there really is something for everyone, and Panos and V surpass all expectations when it comes to taking care of you by the pool each day.My true version of ""the perfect summer day"" is hanging at the pool at the Santorini Secret. Just make sure you don't leave without trying a ""Manos-tini""...the ideal vacation drink!   Room Tip: Make sure you meet Manos! See more room tips",0
"I was just AMAZING staying in the Spectacular Suites, from the moment we arrived, we where upgraded to one of the suites with the private pool and amazing view. Thank you to all the Staff and of course to my Latinos that made us feel at home in our stay there, also our new friend Manos he was so wonderful with his hospitality. We can't wait to visit again a reunite with our new friends!!!   Room Tip: All rooms have ocean view - love it!!!!! See more room tips",0
"Our stay was perfect thanks to the incredible staff and incredible room! If you want the best room there, request 33. It's far removed from foot traffic so it's very private and it overlooks the pool. The breakfast was the best I've ever had at any hotel I've visited (must try the mini donuts). The staff went above and beyond for us, especially Manos, the bar manager, as he recommended us many places to eat and they all turned out to be amazing (we requested restaurants where the locals go). He is very sociable and helpful and made our stay that much better.The view can be amazing throughout Oia but it is best viewed from the Santorini Secret Suites!",1
"I had an amazing evening, Leo prepared the most amazing Santorini secret cocktail and Manos was wonderful their hospitality made me feel at home. The menu is simply delightful, the view is phenomenal please don't leave without checking this place out",2
"The hotel is perfectly located in the beginning of Oia versus deep in Oia where there are tons of traffic due to cruise ship drop offs. From the concierge, the manager Louisa and Manos who manages the bar and restaurant, staff was helpful, friendly, kind and just fun to speak to. We were in room 20 which is a Pure suite. It was large, and had an outdoor jacuzzi. I normally don't like hotel pools but this one was rarely crowded, the view can't be beat and the drinks at the pool bar were fantastic. Also the Greek salad which you can order for lunch by the pool or at the restaurant was the best Greek salad I had all week. I plan to write a separate review of Blackrock, the restaurant, but trust me and go! It's fantastic as well and better than most of the restaurants I ate at in Oia. I can't wait to go back to this hotel.",2
"Wonderful, clean hotel in a great location. The staff is friendly (Hi Pavlo!) and helpful. The breakfast is brought to the room every morning and is awesome. Beautiful views from the Jacuzzi tub on the balcony. My one and only criticism would be that the balconies are not private: only semi-private. We had to walk through someone else's balcony to get to our room which was a little awkward at times, especially when other guests were laying out or in the tub. This is a small price to pay, however, and is a normal part of the cool labrantine style architecture and just adds to the character of this unique boutique hotel.",2
"Spent 4 days in Santorini at Santorini Secret with my wife. It is an idyllic 'bubble', perfect for relaxation and visiting this special part of the world. All of the staff could not do enough to make it a special experience and the view is just amazing. The rooms are great, the terrace with the hot tub was perfect, if you didn't want to join the bustle of Oia. You could just move from balcony to pool to the fabulous restaurant. The staff could not do enough and provided flawless recommendations and created an relaxed but exclusive feel, which was spot on.Cannot recommend highly enough.",1
"Can't rave enough about the Santorini Secret! Rooms are gorgeous and spacious, each with its own private patio where you can soak in your hot tub or pool, have a luxurious breakfast delivered each morning or just watch the sunset. The staff is amazing, especially our buddy Manos who is super charming and will recommend the best places for you to go. Louisa at the front desk is a doll, providing us with outstanding accommodations when circumstances required us to show up a night early without reservation! The pool is relaxing and beautiful , with wonderful service and the location is ideal. Can't wait to go back!!!",1
"Visited 7th - 14th may. Wonderful hotel, attention to detail, service, ambiance made this a very special birthday. Staff couldn't do enough for us and very helpful with arranging things. Manos the pool/ bar manager was delightful and always on hand with info for tours or great restaurant advice. Rooms were of a high standard with fantastic views of the Caldera. Breakfast was always of good quality and very close to chosen time. Thank you Santorini secret and staff, i had an amazing birthday :-).......ps hot tub was a great addition, and wifi worked all of the time unlike other 5* hotels!!   Room Tip: for more privacy ask for a room not underneath a stairway, although it was quiet and was no bother. See more room tips",1
"Dined at the restaurant this week for my birthday - best restaurant I've ever been. Service was amazing, waiters offering suggestions for meals and wines. Complimentary appetizers were delicious, as were all the dishes. Beautifully presented, we felt well looked after. Would recommend to anyone wanting a little fine dining with a gorgeous caldera view",0
"I just got back from a four night stay at Santorini Secret for a friends trip. Our goal was to just relax and explore Greece (we also visited Mykonos and Athens). Of all the hotels that we stayed at, Santorini Secret was by far our favorite. Our room was spacious, super clean and the view was something from out of a dream. We loved waking up each morning and having breakfast on our balcony with that stunning view. The best part, however, was the service and hospitality. From our driver that picked us up at the port to the entire staff, we were blown away by the attention. The hospitality of Manos was exceptional and he really went above and beyond, from recommending things to do, to even the attention of making sure you had a towel ready to go as soon as stepped foot outside of the pool. He was amazing! The hotel is also perfectly situated in Oia (which I highly recommend over staying at Fira). We also LOVED the restaurant, even more than other restaurants we visited (such as Sphinx and Red Bicycle). The food was delicious (you need to try the lamb and tzatziki sauce). Overall if you're looking for a hotel to stay in Santorini, look no further than Santorini Secret. I really can't say enough nice things. See you next year!",1
"We stayed for 5 nights on our honeymoon and had a lovely stay, made all the more enjoyable by the hospitality of Manos. We relaxed by the pool most days and from taking photos, recommending places to go to complimentary cocktails, he did it! Loved the breakfasts on our balcony each day too and would recommend trying some of the local dishes on there, very good!",1
"When you see a post card of Santorini, some of those pics were probably taken from this hotel. Probably the best possible location, with amazing views and plenty of local shops and restaurants with water view in waking distance. The rooms are generously sized. Breakfast served to your room each morning free of charge or you can eat at the restaurant - all food is freshly prepared. Finally the staff were extremely helpful and gave great service. Thank you so much for an unforgettable experience. We will definitely be back.",0
"How do you describe perfection? This spot which is perfectly located in the mid point of the pedestrian way is flawless. The rooms are wonderfully architected, spotless and filled with every amenity. The staff lead by Luisa and Manos meet every need. The morning breakfast ritual starts everyday with wonderful food sitting on your own balcony watching cruise ships in the caldera. The pool and staff are beyond wonderful. It is the very essence of Greek Island luxury.The Greek hospitality could teach the rest of the world on how to treat guests. I miss my man Manos!   Room Tip: Does it matter. You only need to choose between a private pool or hot tub See more room tips",2
The secret is this is an amazing hotel. Best one I've ever stayed at. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's a cliff side hotel with breathtaking views. Each suite either has a hot tub or a pool with a semi private balcony with an amazing view. Breakfast can be served on your balcony. I had the pure suite and the room was a perfect size. The bathroom was huge. I can't say enough nice things about this place and would recommend it to anyone.,1
"I stayed at Santorini Secret in July 2015 and it was the most memorable part of my trip to Greece. The staff (particularly Manos and George) went above and beyond to make sure that our experience was amazing and make us feel welcome and valued. The location is convenient and the hotel was happy to arrange transportation whenever needed. After exploring the island, we concluded that the view from our hotel was the best around. The hotel helped us arrange dinner reservations, wine tasting, and other excursions and had solid recommendations when we were making our plans. I highly recommend that you stay here.",0
"Everything was superb!! The view was breathtaking!! The room spotless clean. The friendliest staff and the most helpful!! We will definitely come back as soon as possible!! We really can't wait for our next visit!! Thank you for the amazing experience Manos, Louiza, George and everybody else!! See you soon!!!   Room Tip: all the rooms have the same breathtaking view See more room tips",0
"We stayed there with my partner, our baby daughter and our nanny from the 24th till 28th April 2016.Unfortunately, this was the worst hotel experience we have had.- - Staff’s knowledge of English was extremely poor causing constant confusion and miscommunication- - The heated pool at the villa had no heating and was essentially out of use, this was brought up to the management’s attention on the first day, but never fixed- - The hotel claims to offer SPA when essentially it is just a swimming pool with no other facilities- The villa we stayed in is on a busy street with a low fence around it and large signs saying “Secret villa” which attracts tourists to look into the garden/take pictures and even walk into the villa and gives the guests no privacy whatsoever- - Several times during our stay we had power cuts and no hot running water- - Towels and bath robes strongly smelled of smoke throughout our stay although the management was made aware of the issue- - On the first day we were told that we can only order breakfast the night before ( no later than 9 pm) in written form which is very inconvenient to say the least- - The view from the rare windows was that of a junk yard, which is unacceptable for a luxury hotel- - Level of customer service was completely appalling: staff making up the room refusing to clear dirty dishes and asking to call their colleagues, management being extremely unhelpful and deceitful- - The rooms were not tidied properly with bins not emptied, shampoos/tissues not replacedWe are extremely disappointed by our stay and such a poor experience at Santorini Secret has, unfortunately, ruined my birthday and our short holiday entirely.   Room Tip: do not go for the villa! See more room tips",5
"Arriving at Santorini secret hotel, we were welcomed in the most warmth way. This stuff is extreme helpful and polite. The view absolutely outstanding... Breathtaking!!Breakfast is served at your room and is delicious!! Don't you dare forget to dine at the black rock restaurant.. Aaa and congratulate the chef afterwards!!!",2
"We received the warmest hospitality from our host, Louiza! From a warm welcome, to getting everything planned and done for you, until the fond farewell!! We cannot imagine a world without Louiza! All the staff there are superb and attentive!",1
"We booked through Aegean website, after recommendation of this hotel by a friend. The room was spotless and large. My only complaints are no standing shower and cold breakfast. No enough effort is made to bring hot breakfast to the room quickly. The hotel should also recommend guests to rent car. Parking is easy. Staff is very friendly, helpful. We may not be coming back soon, but will always remember Santinori and Secret.",0
"Small, boutique hotel in the cliffs of Santorini. When we first checked in we were not happy with our room, the manager arranged for a room change and we were very happy with our stay.Rooms are all suites, lots of room to spread out, we had a deck with a hot tub over looking the Ocean. Breakfast was delivered to your room each morning.The pool was one level down, convenient for us.We thoroughly enjoyed our trip, note to other potential travelers...there are a lot of stairs to go up and down from your room to the street. For someone with a mobility issue this would not work well   Room Tip: Definitely ask for a suite with a shower. The rooms with tubs are dangerous to get in and out of wi... See more room tips",0
"My partner and I have just had a 7 night stay at this lovely hotel. Photographs can't do it justice as each room has a balcony view of the Caldera, which is beyond breathtaking.I think it is important to mention the steep and plentiful steps in Oia, and access to the hotel was no exception. No problem, unless you have medical problems that could be affected, and, ladies, choose your holiday shoes to allow for this!The room was clean, classy and had lots of space, especially the gorgeous bathroom. The round bed had a memory foam mattress and was comfortable. Each evening a lady arrived with 2 small bottles of water and 2 large chocolates. It is worth noting that the faucet water is not drinkable. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi, 2 very comfortable sun loungers and a table and chairs. Each evening we were given a sheet to mark off our breakfast choices and leave in reception. The choice, amount and standard of food was excellent.Breakfast was delivered on a large tray to the balcony each day at our chosen time. I don't know how the staff managed it! Fitness and strength must be part of the job description!The pool area was clean, relaxing and very comfortable. It is compact, but due to the time of year and the fact that many rooms have private pools, it was never overcrowded or noisy during our stay. The pool bar staff are the best I've ever experienced anywhere. They anticipated the need to shade you using the large umbrellas, provided dry towels if the one on your lounger looked soggy, provided and topped up iced water to keep everyone hydrated and maintained the area in spotless condition. I have to give a special mention to someone, that I believe is almost famous at this point.... Manos. What an extraordinarily caring and lovely individual he is. Not only good at his job, but has a special way of making you feel "" cared for"" as well as being a quirky and loveable guy. It all turns out he is an excellent photographer with an iPhone! I could have adopted him.We had a dinner and a lunch at the Oozori restaurant and sampled both the sushi and Thai food. Both were delicious, but the sushi was our favourite.I don't know what else to say, other than to recommend this place as somewhere to be taken care of from reception onwards. Not cheap, but we definitely got what we paid for.just a note to anyone expecting to see the sunset from the balcony...you can't, but it's just a walk up the road and the Caldera is much more beautiful, if you ask me. Missing it already!   Room Tip: The jacuzzi water filters almost constantly, so be aware that you'll hear it.rooms to the west a... See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Santorini Secret for four nights on our honeymoon and it was legitimately like living inside a postcard! So stunning and so calm - I've never ever felt as relaxed as I did laying by the pool there or on my deck overlooking the ocean. Heaven. Staff are brilliant, breakfast is fantastic, rooms are huge! I HIGHLY recommend trying the sushi from the restaurant too!",0
"I chose the hotel partly because it popped up on Expedia and partly from TripAdvisor reviews. It was a landmark wedding anniversary and the hotel seemed to tick all the boxes. We booked a Pure suite.Lots of positives:- the hotel staff from maintenance and baggage up to the manager wanted to do their best at all times. A real commitment to delighting folk!- the view over the caldera was stunning (albeit with some bushes obstructing it slightly) - it was an absolute joy to see each morning!- great pool with a view and bar staff there.- breakfasts were great and a good menu to choose from although slightly odd having to order the time and selection the night before - been able to dine outside our room made up for this.- we ate once in the restaurant and the food was good (Asian theme) - we also ordered sushi via room service too as we liked it so much at the restaurant.- the room was serviced twice daily and was always impeccably clean.A few areas stopped me giving the hotel an excellent ranking though:- in the last three days we had issues with our jacuzzi hot tub not heating up - I see at least one other review mention this as a problem too. Didn't seem to have the right servicing support. Well meaning maintenance staff tried three times to repair but didn't seem to be able to resolve the issue! A shame as we really enjoyed it in the first few days. - we had a cleaning cupboard outside our room (22) and within our patio area - every morning this created a degree of noise - surely this could be located elsewhere?- a real problem replacing glasses in the room - had to endlessly call for new ones. - a slightly chaotic reception at times - one receptionist didn't seem to know the sunset time and nearly booked our sunset restaurant at the wrong time. We also had a poor experience checking out but hats off to the manager in offering us back our room until we left at 715pm as recompense.Overall, though, a good experience.",2
"My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in this marvelous boutique hotel overlooking the Caldera. Excellent room with out door hot tub/ jaccuzi and a breath-taking view. The staff are extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the room terrace is a must! So are the cocktails served by Manos by the pool. A wonderful place!",0
"By far the nicest place I have stayed in awhile! The staff was so nice and generous, the breakfast was delicious and you can't put a price on that view! We had our own hot tub and we felt during our stay that we were in our own little villa in Santorini. An amazing experience.",0
"My wife and I like to treat ourselves to one European vacation per year. For our 2015 trip, we decided to visit Greece. One of our stops was in Santorini. We chose to stay at the Santorini Secret for 5 nights and it was by far the best stay we ever had. The view was phenomenal and the breakfast were sumptuous. The staff was absolutely wonderful, and a special thanks to our friend/bartender Manos who treated us like royalty. If money isn't an issue, and you like to be pampered, then don't hesitate. Santorini Secret is the place to be.",0
"We came here for the first five nights of our honeymoon. Our goal was to just relax, and we decided not to visit any other islands. We finished our trip with 4 nights in Imerovigli, and then 2 nights in Athens. Of the three hotels we stayed at, Santorini Secret was our favorite!The view is obviously great, and the room (we stayed in Room 10) was new and spacious. The best part about the room was that it was very quiet, which made for great night's of sleep (we literally got a much needed 14 hours of sleep our first night). One comment about the room is that we didn't have a shower (only a large bathtub), which we found odd and a bit inconvenient. Still, we loved our room. Each day, we filled out our breakfast order and entered the time we wanted it delivered. We opted for 10 a.m., and without fail, it was delivered at exactly 10 a.m. each morning (this was in comparison to our other hotel in Imerovigli, which only delivered the breakfast within 30 minutes of the time entered - not a huge deal, but it shows the attention to detail at Santorini Secret). The breakfast was very good, although we didn't love the eggs.What made this hotel was the location and especially the service. The location was right near the center of the walkway in Oia - lots of shops and very good restaurants just a few steps away. Many of the other luxury hotels in Oia require a walk along a busy roadway to get to the center of Oia - we were happy that we didn't have to do this.The best part of our stay was the service. From the minute we arrived, we were blown away by the tremendous service. Everyone appeared genuinely interested in helping to make our stay the best it could be. A special shout-out to Manos, who made amazing cocktails by the pool and made reservations for us at fantastic restaurants. I would say that Santorini Secret should be a 4 star hotel, but that the staff's effort to go above and beyond makes it a 5 star hotel.",0
"What can i say about this hospitality!! Great view of Caldera and volcano, in the center of Oia , the room very clean, excellent breakfast and amazing sushi restautant. The personnel very polite, specially Manolis the driver and Helen from the reception",1
The hotel is seemingly in the center of Oia's caldera. Stunning views! Our room was spacious and comfortable. The staff was so helpful in all ways. The only complaint was that the shower was very difficult to operate.,0
We absolutely loved everything about Santorini secret!! The location the room the views the staff.The staff genuinely take an interest in making sure your every need and requirement is catered for. Nothing was bad. Very much looking forward to returning! It was absolutely perfect! Really!,0
I'm glad I booked this hotel because it is as good as or even better than the beautiful photos let on! The rooms are pristine when other Greek island hotels have white furnishings that are not entirely white anymore. The rooms are spacious and relaxing. The service is excellent and friendly. They could do with improving the water pressure in the shower which is not the easiest to use but everything else was great! And the location is perfect for access to shops and restaurants of oia and fabulous views.,0
"We arrived to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. Called hotel in advance and they arranged for transfer service from the airport (necessary due to scarcity of taxis on island). Upon arriving, we were awestruck by the beauty of the island, and the views from the hotel! We had an amazing time at Santorini Secret - we can't say enough about the view from our room and the pool. And the service was top notch. From the gentleman who threw our bags on his shoulder to traverse the many steps (it is on the side of a cliff), to the great breakfast service, the polite housekeeping staff, and the amazing bar service we received from their awesome mixologist Manos! A little thirsty from our trip, he offered us a welcome drink which hit the spot - and which we repeatedly ordered during our stay. But all his drinks were good, and the service at the pool was great - he even gave us great suggestions for the Athens leg of our trip. The rooms, amenities and service are everything you would expect from a top destination hotel/resort. And the memories we created made this a fabulous anniversary trip!",0
"We celebrated our 12 year anniversary here and stayed for three days. We found the location to be excellent and could walk up to shops, bars and restaurants easily. The hotel is small and therefore the staff get to know you quickly and are very helpful. We were given the best service here. The food is good, especially the sushi and the duck salad is amazing. Some of the rooms can be seen from the pedestrians walking past but if you ask for a more private room they will happily accommodate. Must say that the massage at the spa was very good although on the pricey side. All in all a fab holiday and would recommend to anyone looking for a couple break.",0
"We were treated very well at our stay at Santorini Secret!The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Oia with easy access to many restaurants and shops. All the staff that we encountered were exceptional. We stayed in Suite 2 with a private pool and the most amazing view! The bathroom was very large with a modern multi-jet shower. The bed should be upgrade, however. Breakfast was prompt and with a smile. Dinner reservations were made on our behalf and we were pleased with the restaurant that Mano recommended. Upon arrival, we waited by the pool (which is quite lovely) until our room was ready and we were treated extremely well by all the staff!! It was paradise!",0
"This hotel is as stunning as it gets. The view is the best i've ever seen! The simplicity of the room, the ambiance of the hotel, and excellent location make this truly Santorini's hidden Secret. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast on the balcony of your room with that stunning view itself is quite the experience. One thing i didnt like though, was that the hotel doesnt provide you with an iron for your cloths, all my shirts needed ironing and the fact that they couldnt provide an iron because of ""security"" reasons, and then charged me (not sure i think it was 6-8 Euros) to iron a single shirt is just not acceptable for a 5 star property. Either you provide an iron, or charge a reasonable amout for ironing.Other than that this hotel is fantastic, the stairs can be a real hassle sometimes but is good exercise for those who dont mind it, there are LOTS of stairs. But thats the case mostly everywhere in Santorini.",0
"I stayed at the Santorini Secret in July with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. We stayed in a Premium Suite with private jacuzzi on the large terrace. The hotel is ideally placed in the centre of Oia, only a short stroll to the many shops and restaurants. I found the hotel to be excellent, the staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful, especially Manos the barman, who went out of his way to cater for your every need, and serving up iced water all day long by the pool. The food at the hotel was outstanding, breakfast was served a la carte, either on your terrace or in the restaurant, with a great choice on offer and we had lunch in the restaurant every day which was amazing too, a great choice of salads, in fact the best Greek salad I have ever tasted, along with other choices, served up by two lovely girls in the morning and two great guys at lunchtime. We usually had dinner out in the evening as there are some lovely restaurants in town. The only negative that I found at Santorini Secret was, the first room we were allocated was at the entrance of the hotel and was overlooked by all the tourists on the main street, but Marina the Hotel Manageress was extremely helpful and moved us to a different room the very next morning in a much quieter situation. I will definitely return to the Santorini Secret on my next visit to the island, overall outstanding.   Room Tip: Lower rooms, away from the street See more room tips",1
"We have just spent 5 blissful days at Santorini Secret. The service was outstanding, the room extremely comfortable, the views awesome. We are not the type to revisit places we've already experienced, but, I have a feeling we will come back here. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to switch off and reconnect with what's beautiful, sincere, and tasteful.",2
"My girlfriend and I spent an amazing week here to celebrate her birthday. The hotel is perfectly positioned for visiting Oia town on foot, there are some lovely restaurants, bars and shops. We had a lovely room with a private jacuzzi. The room was great but we felt a shower rather than a bath would have been more convenient, our only criticism. All of the staff are amazing, the best I have experienced. We were always very well looked after and made to feel special. Special thanks to Manos who runs the pool bar, a mine of information regarding restaurants etc. He genuinely cares about all his guests. We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel most days and the food is better than you normally find in hotel restaurants, the chef is very modest but really talented. We would definitely go again!!!",1
"We booked to stay at Santorini Secret as our special gift to each other for our forthcoming 35th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with happy faces, friendly advice and a warm welcome. The property is well positioned and our room was spacious, airy and spotless. I could go in to more detail but what really makes this a standout hotel is the amazing staff. Staff can make or break even the most luxurious property and here, each staff member we have met, is friendly yet professional and has gone out of their way to help us.They have booked tours, restaurants, transfers- they have given advice and then cared enough to follow up on whether we were satisfied or not.There are too many staff to name but Marina and Manos(at the bar) have been our constant local experts and we thank them.It is a pleasure staying here and we look forward to returning and spreading the word about this wonderful hotel.",0
"Such a stunning hotel, perfectly located in Oia, not right in the busy centre but only a few minutes stroll away makes it the perfect oasis for a relaxing holiday. All the staff are so very friendly and accommodating. I cannot commend them or rate their service highly enough.Each stunning bedroom has amazing views of the Caldera, wonderful to watch from the private terraces over breakfast.... Or from the private jacuzzi for each bedroom.The Oozara restaurant serves amazing sushi, highly recommended!",0
"Great staff, great accommodations. Private Infiniti pool overlooking the Aegean, not sure how you beat that. Manos, who works the pool bar, is incredibly sweet and helpful guy and just generally added to our experience. Others also went out of their way. Just great overall.",0
"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left our experience was wonderful. This boutique hotel is in the perfect location... Close to shops, restaurants and sites worth seeing. As this hotel was build only a year ago, everything is still new and fresh. Our bathroom was huge by most 5 star hotel standards. The view from our suite was amazing... Looking down at the ocean/ Caldera and distant towns.The staff really made our stay memorable. They were courteous, friendly and helpful. Manos at the pool bar provided awesome service, great cocktails and recommended good restaurants and things to do. Maria and Cali at the hotel's restaurant remembered the smallest details of how we liked our coffee each morning. The best hotel in Oia and Santorini.",0
"First and foremost, Santorini Secret is the complete package. The hospitality, room, food, environment and scenery was outstanding. If you had any questions about the town, the concierge would not only make the best recommendations but also handle all reservations on your behalf. They would make absolutely sure you were well taken care of when you reached the restaurant, car rental, boat or store. In fact, Manos(staff member) made all of our reservations for when we traveled to Mykonos and the chefs at each restaurant went above and beyond the expectation. Make sure you ask for Manos if you're heading to Mykonos after Santoroni.Do not fret over the crisis in Greece. As a tourist, you will barely even sense it.Enjoy",1
Beautiful resort with amazing people and views! The food was delicious and the pool was relaxing. The massage was unbelievable. Can not say anything bad about this pace. The room was very spacious and comfortable.,0
What a blessing to stay at the Secret hotel. Very helpful staff sometimes a bit slow with a greek charme to it. Its is a quaint boutique hotel with bigger aspirations. The service level was super but not outstanding. Something they could work up to achieve. The grounds are spectacular and the view is amazing. We had a lovely time thanks soo much,0
"I will start by saying this hotel is beautiful. Amazing views, nice room. My teenage daughters and I were enjoying our stay until the morning we were leaving and we noticed my daughter's Macbook laptop was missing from her backpack. She had not used it at all during this trip in Santorini. Her backpack was open during our entire 1 week trip, as she used other items in her backpack, but not the laptop. I did see it in there the entire trip.I had my own Mac laptop also, which I used daily and left it out to charge while we were out. Obviously, the person who stole hers must have noticed that hers wasn't being used, so took it the night before we were meant to check out. Her black hat was also gone. She had placed this on the floor close to her laptop.I called the reception immediately, and the manager, Marina basically accused me of lying. She started yelling on the phone "" This is an outrageous accusation, you are accusing us of something very serious. All my staff are very trustworthy. We opened in March, and this has never happened in this property"". While we were upstairs waiting for our suitcases to come up, she went on and on about how this has never happened before, and I am making things up.....then went as far as telling me, the Amex I left to pay for my stay was not good, and my payment had been declined in front of other guests. This was so appalling and embarrassing. There was nothing wrong with my card, of course. As soon as I walked up, I looked at my statement and I had already received an email from Amex stating the charge went through. This accusation of my card not working was just to distract from my stolen laptop.Nevertheless, this experience on the morning we were checking just turned my 1 week Santorini visit sour, and I could not believe the humiliation I received from Marina after being a guest at this supposedly 5 star hotel. I have traveled the world and stayed in many 5 star hotels, and have never had anything stolen from me before.It's amazing they trust their staff so much, and will humiliate guests and accuse guests of lying! Unbelievable!!!Well, beware Patrons of Santorini Secret. Put ALL YOUR VALUABLES IN THE SAFE, AND THE BULKIER ITEMS IN YOUR SUITCASES AND PADLOCK THEM. I DO NOT WISH THIS EXPERIENCE ON ANY ONE ELSE. There is someone OR people amongst their staff that is stealing. I bet they will strike again.",7
We came to Oia for a 4 night stay. I had found this hotel on trip advisor and my travel agent had never heard if it. Against her advice I booked it myself online. I am so happy I did. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well. When I was not happy with our first room (only due to it's proximity to the pedestrian street)Marina the manager was quick to show me 3 others that may make us happy. We quickly found one and it was a free upgrade to make sure we where happy with our stay. All the staff go out of there way to make your stay amazing. They arranged car rentals and restaurant reservations everything you could ask for. We had great drinks from Manos the amazing bartender who made each drink to your personal taste. Nikko the coffee maestro gave me a treat each morning and Vassilous whose sushi and Thai restaurant was melt in your mouth good. We loved every minute of the pool and room. Views are spectacular and in one of the best Oia locations out of the crowds. We are picky New Yorkers and we will for sure be back!,0
"We stayed at Santorini Secret for 1 week and found the whole experience unforgettable. from the moment we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome by all the staff. They were friendly, hard-working, discreet, accommodating, happy and nothing was too much trouble for them. If they could help in any way they all went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. The rooms were cleaned twice daily to an extremely high standard and the housekeeping team were very cheery and happy. We ate at the restaurant or pool everyday and the food was always to an excellent standard, as was the a la Carte breakfast. The location of Santorini Secret gives guests the most spectacular views anyone could wish for. We shall miss waking up and seeing that amazing view whilst enjoying breakfast on our terrace. Visiting the Spa is a must for anybody while staying here. The calm and relaxing environment in the spa makes any treatment enjoyable. Nicole the spa manager is extremely knowledgable and helpful in guiding clients to choose the best experience for them. Her gentle and calm nature makes her perfect for this role as well as a great asset to the team at Santorini Secret. We visited the pool everyday where clean towels are always available. Fresh iced water is served and topped up throughout the day free of charge by the bar manager Manos. Manos is charming, helpful, humble and a special person who we will not forget! We would recommend everyone to stay at Santorini Secret, our experience was unforgettable!!!!!!",0
"Went for a 4 night stay to this beautiful hotel, felt like royalty from the minute we was picked up at the airport by John the Driver, he was so informative about the area and really nice with it. All the staff here really could not do much more for you, on arrival to reception the process of checking in was extremely easy and was even offered a welcome drink, we did not even have to bother with our luggage this was all dealt with for us. The welcome drink was so nice we decided to head straight to pool bar to get another one!! Here we met Manos what a legend, he is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet, he would bend over backwards to make sure your stay is perfect. One afternoon we were talking about wine choices to him, he knew which restaurant we had a booking at that particular evening, so he took it upon himself to call the restaurant to check whether they had a particular wine in!! There is not one single downside to this hotel, made even more special with all the staff here and the most spectacular viewsCannot wait for a return trip!!!",0
Make sure you know the exact room you reserve. We paid through bookings.com for a room overlooking the sea and we ended up staying in a room on the ground floor overlooking the street. You could still see the sea at a distance but only when no pedestrians were passing by. PS. Pedestrians outside could easily see inside the room.,7
"Santorini Secret is an amazing place. From the moment we walked down to the bar and pool area, we were blown away by the view, the incredible staff and the breathtaking views of the Caldera. Manos is an incredible bartender. Every day, he made sure each guest was cared for and made the most exquisite libations to enjoy. He also had great advice on where to dine while in Santorini and travel while in the Greek Isles. If you needed anything, he was there to help or make a call.Marina, the manager was delightful and ensured that each guest was always well taken care of.The food at Oozora was some of the best Japanese sushi and fusion food. I have traveled the world and this establishment rivaled some of the top sushi places. The watermelon, tomato and burrata salad was out of this world.The service and staff at Santorini Secret is outstanding, personal and extremely thoughtful. We look forward to returning to this magical place.",0
"All suites hotel in Oia with view of the entire caldera. Infinity pool overlooking the best view in town. Newest holed In Oia with grand rooms and bathroom. Note that some rooms have bath and no shower when you make your reservation or checking in. The hotel has a private parking lot a few staps away from the hotel. It is agreat amenity for car renters. Breakfast to order can be served to your room at no extra cost. Nice service served to your private veranda, but the leftovers may stay for sometime. So, I recommend, you order your coffee and juices to the room and then walk down to the restaurant besides the pool for a relaxed breakfast with a view. Great service all around. Spa treatments are available. The massage by Caroline is highly recommended. Like all Oia hotels with a view, it comes with planty of stairs you cannot avoid.",0
"I could easily say that what made Santorini Secrets so very special was that it had perhaps one of the best infinity pools in the world, situated as it is in absolute paradise overlooking one of the best views you will ever see. Or I could say that Santorini Secrets was so very special because you can order some of the best food or drink you will ever have at their bar and restaurant. But truthfully, even though all that is true, what made Santorini Secrets so special was the team of individuals who work there, all of whom genuinely care that each guest has the time of his or her life.  Manos is an unbelievable bartender not only because his drinks are to die for, but also because he is so incredibly thoughtful that while you are at the pool you feel as though you are the king or queen of England. Stavros is a great concierge; Basilas is a fantastic maitre d' that runs one of the best restaurants and sushi bars that you will find. But all of it starts with Marina, who gives hospitality a new meaning. From the moment you arrive, are greeted by Marina, and get this unbelievable passion fruit welcome drink from Manos, you know you came to the right place.Evan June 2015",1
"From the minute we arrived, I knew this place was top notch. We were greeted with smiles and extremely helpful staff. Especially the bartender who went out of his way to give us tips and male us dinner reservations and local spots.We were upgraded to our suprise to a grand suite. It was unreal. Pictures do not do this place justice.The view is incredible. We had a private pool and did not want to leave because it definitely was the best view on the island. Away from all the tourists.The bed and pillows were plush and felt luxurious. They gave you top of the line amenities in the bathrooms. Our room was beautiful and cave like. Just as you would expect.Breakfast is served to your balcony. And the options were endless.If you're staying in Oia, you need to stay at this hotel. It's top of the line but the prices aren't extreme. Definitely worth every single penny.",1
"We were guests at Santorini Secret during the first week of June. The setting is magnificent, in the best town on the island, Oia, where everyone goes to capture the beautiful sunsets. The service is absolutely outstanding, so personalized, efficient, and kind, it doesn't get any better than this. A wonderful place to relax, no need to ever leave your terrace with breathtaking views. The only outings we felt were worthwhile to venture off the property for were: a semi private sunset sail - great way to see the island, do some swimming, then have a relaxing dinner on board followed by the sunset; a visit to the Akrotiri archeological site; and a wine tasting at the Santo winery. The concierge will assist guests with all arrangements for excursions, great restaurant recommendations, ... Santorini Secret also has a wonderful restaurant that includes incredible breakfasts you can have delivered to your terrace at no extra charge - what a way to start your day. Also great sushi, salads,... Can't imagine a better place to stay on this heavenly island.   Room Tip: A room towards the bottom levels offer more privacy as well as being closer to the restaurant and re... See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed here for four nights in early June as part of our honeymoon. The hotel and the staff are outstanding! The views from the room and the pool are breathtaking and the location in Oia is perfect. They took care of our dinner reservations our entire stay, which led to amazing food and the best seats at every restaurant. The bartender at the pool was outstanding as well. The main reason I did not give them five stars is that they messed up our airport shuttle departure time (for a very early flight) and we had a very stressful experience trying to get to the airport on time as a result. It would also be nice if they upgraded their beds to kings and had a better pillow selection. Overall though, highly recommended!",0
"The three of us have been there 4 nights at the beginning of August.The good things.High quality.Beautiful room.High attention to customers.Location that is absolutely the best in Oia, no other place like this.What can improve.Wifi connection is poor, in case you need it.The rooms on the west side are a bit exposed to tourists that are taking pictures of a church that is next door. Rooms refitting sometimes missed a few details.The bar might consider to stay open a bit later in the evening.Overall is a great place, close to perfection, you pay up for very high quality. I strongly recommend.",1
"My husband and I have just returned from our favorite place on earth -Santorini. It's a Santorini is special place for us since we traveled there together as young adults, in the backpacking days, staying in a pension on the beach for a month. Well, we've grown up but our love for Santorini grows stronger. For the last 11 years we have returned to Oia, the most beautiful part of the island. We have alternately stayed at Aspaki and Oia Castle and love them both. When I say ""love"", I truly mean it. First and most important are the views. Wow. How do you explain 'breathtaking'? My husband and I never tire of waking in the morning, stepping out on the terrace and seeing heaven on earth. The terrace is central to our stay. Looking out to the picturesque town and the Caldera, we start our day with our own Santorini workout. My husband does a run up and down the stairs to Armeni Port. And then we do our own workout with resistance bands right on the terrace looking out at pure beauty. It's a fantastic start to the day. Reward time - breakfast in the Aspaki Cafe! Every option is delicious and we should know because we've tried them all! The service at both Aspaki and Oia Castle is impeccable. Whatever your needs, the professional staff is on it and they couldn't be nicer. Another favourite moment is getting into bed! The Cocomatt beds are the most comfy beds, I've ever slept in. Not a single part of my body has an ache in the morning which is rare for me. Visits to Santorini are spiritual for my husband and I. The restaurants are delightful and there is no such thing as a bad meal. We are foodies so that's important to us. Aspaki and Oia Castle are perfect. The views - like no other on earth. The sunsets - spectacular. The sea - healing. We leave Santorini with a sense of happiness and well being. It's always perfection and we will always look forward to going back because there is nowhere better to be. We've traveled extensively but only Santorini feeds our soul. I'm excited for anyone who visits because you too can find the sheer beauty and love you feel in every thing you see, every bite you take, every swim you do... It's just very special.",2
Romantic and luxury stay~ Service is excellent!Enjoyed the beautiful sunset peacefully in our balcony. The best place to enjoy Oia Sunset and the best place for a romantic honeymoon which gave us an unforgettable memory.,3
"Well.. We had a stay at the Honeymoon Villa of the Oia Castle at the extreme end of Oia Hill, Santorini. It was the most beautiful stay of ours ever. With the most Romantic and peaceful view. The Manager Mr Elias was super friendly and so were all other staff members Alex, John, etc.This part of the Oia has the best views of the sunset with great views of passing cruise ships, etc. What more should I say - I have a loss of words as I havent stayed at any more beautiful place ever ! ! ! For any specific doubts of any interested travellor I am always available just a click away.   Room Tip: All the rooms have great views - that's what they take the huge charges for ! See more room tips",2
"We stayed here for four nights. For the first day, we took the bus to Santorini, and was at lost about finding the hotel. We talked to travel agency at the bus stop, and the lady kindly called the hotel staff for us. The hotel staff then came to the bus stop to help us carry the luggage through the narrow and winded alleys in Santorini. For the first night, we were ""upgraded"" to a honeymoon suite at the Hotel Aspaki, which has excellent ocean view and jacuzzi, but you won't see the famous sunset here because it was on the other side of the cliff. For the rest of the night, we were moved to the Oia Castle, which has its own kitchen and has direct access to the sunset view. The breakfast option at Hotel Aspaki is better than the ones in Oia Castle and has egg benedict which I liked. The rooms were spotless and cleaned every day while we went out for lunch, and the beds were comfortable. Overall, this is a luxurious hotel worthy of its premium price. The only complaint I have is that the water temperature in the Jacuzzi couldn't be adjusted, so it was not very comfortable to sit in for a long time; the water in it wasn't very clean either. I wish I could get to stay in those rooms with in-suite pool!",2
The hotel was simply amazing there was a Pool in my room and the customer service was just simply outstanding. We got to enjoy a beautiful sunset in Santorini everyday together and the view from my balcony was nothing short of breath taking me and my wife love this hotel so much that we are planning on coming back,2
Was given an upgrade to the Cave pool room. Room was spacious and the view was simply out of this world. Staff service was very good and the breakfast was great. A huge gathering can always be spotted outside the hotel entrance as it as one of the best views of the caldera and also of OIA. But the gem of views is within the hotel... All private and beautiful. Worth every dollar spent!,1
"With only 3 nights and 2 days in Santorini, being centrally located with amazing views was very important to us. We don't usually spend much on hotels but because of the excellent reviews we treated ourselves and booked the Art Maisons Aspaki. We knew we were paying up for the location and ""cavernous"" accommodations - which I'll brag about later - but we were blown away by the hospitality, warmth, friendliness, and personalized service of the entire staff.From before we even checked in until checkout, Daniela was totally on top of our stay with Askpaki including the driver waiting for us at the airport. The bellhop was awaiting our arrival and eagerly took all of our luggage up and down the crowded little stone streets of Oia. Julia greeted us upon our late check-in and offered to help us plan the next few days which was exactly what we needed and she steered us in the right direction. During our entire stay there the small but responsive team was phenomenal and continually helped ensure our stay was pleasant and effortless. Breakfast was personally made to order each morning, with 3 courses of fresh tasty food. On our one lazy morning where we slept in until five minutes before breakfast was closing, they were happy to serve and even brought it right to the room.As for the room: it was a 1-bedroom cave suite in fresh white and modern decor. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and our outside balcony was literally breathtaking. Felt like we were in our own private villa with a pool/jacuzzi, soft lounge chairs, table, nook and another swinging chair all directly next to the famous 3 blue-domed cathedral. Oh and even though there's no bad view of the famous Santorini Sunset, we were twice able to take advantage of the private balcony reserved at their sister hotel Oia Castle. Elias greeted us there both nights and we felt like VIP on our own private balcony while others crowded together on the steps nearby",2
"Let me describe oia - the centre of oia is a long cobbled narrow pedestrian street with white atmospheric shops and restaurants either side. It runs along the top of a steep cliff and to one side or a maze of steps running in all directions leading down to the higher part of the cliff where all the accommodation is- no high rise , nothing looks modern, just individual buildings built onto and carved into the cliff face - beautiful and unique At the end of the street ( about 1 mile long) it opens out above beautiful ahmoudi bay More stairways are carved everywhere and one leads to art Maisons - it consists of 4 ( I think) apartments reached by different stairways and secured by a private gate. A few yards away as the crow flies but many steps up and down is the separate breakfast room and a separate office/ reception So not a hotel but a small collection of suites There are 2 further luxury apartments about 400 yards away further round the bay ( many many steps). And I believe art maison have a further collection of suites back along the street but we have not been to thatWe stayed in the sunset suite which is the top of the 4 and under the remains of a castle turret hence oia castle The apartment is beautiful, half built Into the cliff and half protruding. It has a large bed in a largish alcove a sitting area . A few stairs down to a kitchenette and a few more stairs up to the bathroom shower/steam room It also has a private ( but not secluded ) huge balcony with arguably the best views of the legendary sunset. This is its highlight with loungers a jacuzzi and shaded dining area. It is the most beautiful spectacular view of ahmoudi bay and port the caldera and the sun going down. It is breathtakingThe suite is spotless and beautifully furnished. It is serviced twice a day with Fresh towels and cleaning. It is air conditioned and secluded. The breakfast is high quality but limited in choiceElias the concierge was friendly helpful but not too intrusive We really enjoyed our stay for 1 week in July and I have given it 5 stars However. This is not what we booked like a number of other reviews we found ourselves delivered to a different apartment - one of the two remote apartments. We were told that we had been upgraded. There was nothing wrong with the apartment but it wasn't what we had booked. I said we wanted our original booking but were told that other people were already in it I insisted we were shown it in order to see for ourselves if we were being upgraded. While we were at the 4 main suites to see the marine suite we had booked ,elias offered us the sunset suite which we took after some deliberation. Honestly in the end it didn't really matter but I was pissed off at this and it seems to be almost common practise here at art Maisons I will leave it to the management to justify this but either they took our booking knowing it was already booked out. Or they accepted a booking from someone else after taking my money. Either way it isn't on and for this reason I would find somewhere else next time despite the enjoyable time I had here. I wouldn't want the anxiety and possibly not having an option as good as this one. Sorry art maison but that is poor practise for a luxury premium priced accommodation",3
"Cannot recommend highly enough. We had the Aqua suite which had indoor pool, outdoor suntan deck and outdoor undercover jacuzzi, all private and to ourselves. Service levels and room all well on or above expectations. If you're going to Oia you should definitely spend the extra and stay here.THE BEST VIEWS OF THE SUNSET EVER!!!We dined at #1 restaurant in Oia ""Catch"" and the views do not even compare to what you wake up to or go home to each day. Nice breakfast also. Espresso machine in the room itself. Great host and advice on local amenity and restaurant bookings. Easy access to all of Oia.Cannot fault it one bit. We will miss and remember the sunset for years to come.Cheers - Dan and Tarryn.",2
"My husband and I stayed at the Aspaki hotel for our honeymoon trip in Oia. I had emailed the hotel ahead of time and was able to get an amazing upgrade to a beautiful large suite where we even had our own cave pool! The concierge was amazing and i can't believe he carried our luggage up and down through all those stairways. We had lovely breakfast and great personalized attention from Elias. Finding out he was a fellow Canadian was definitely like having a friend away from home. Elias gave us the best advice and referrals to the great restaurants and things to do during our stay. He was always available to help and we relied on his advice. The room was modern, clean, and we had the best view of the sunset which was beyond words. I wish I could live there and it definitely surpassed all our expectations. When visit Santorini again I definitely want to come back! It was the perfect relaxing getaway of our honeymoon.",1
"Where do I even begin this review. It's hard to put into words! We stayed at Oia castle hotel. (Not aspaki) Our flight was diverted, therefore we missed our first night accommodation here. When we arrived, Elias was so attentive, someone let us to carry out bags and we settled in to a gorgeous room. It was our honeymoon so I'd booked a suite with a private jacuzzi. WOW! The benefits of this room as follows: - view- like a pinch yourself moment! - the bed was amazingly comfortable - room was spacious- jacuzzi is a walk down a few steps away from your room, but once you are there it is completely private, and so is the little sun bed, it is impossible for anyone to see you. The sunset view from the jacuzzi (and your room) is best seat in the house. Best part about this room was the walkway where people gather for the sunset is way below your room and jacuzzi, so therefore, ur view and photos are literally 100% uninterrupted and private! Spectactular! Our next 2 nights, ELias was kind enough to upgrade us to the top of the range suite with its own cave pool!!! Omg! This room had all the benefits of our previous room except instead of jacuzzi, u walkabout on your balcony, open a door and literally walk in to your own private cave pool that has a spa in it- it's huge! And was all ours! Features of his room besides what I've just mentioned- massive suite and bathroom - bathroom also has steam room feature - spacious balcony with view of sunset. The view here is equally as good! Only thing here is the pathway where people gather to see sunset is right outside your balcony, people can see you and you can see them and they will be in your photos. Honestly though, it's a small issue really compared to the rest of the magnificence you are getting. Breakfast is amazing and all the staff we encountered for this hotel were friendly, prompt and engaging. Breakfast ordered fresh from a menu, not a buffet, and is always just enough to keep you going to early afternoon after exploring. ELias and his staff know exactly whatnot takes to make you feel like a VIP. I was tossing up between so many hotels in Santorini, and I know there's heaps that look great, but honestly, I couldn't have asked for anywhere better. Yes, I know it's pricy, but trust me, just once if you can, spend the money and stay here as a splurge, I promise you will NOT regret it! Location is great. Yes there's a lot of steps, but this is Santorini, it's on the side of a cliff so gotta be expected. Heaps of fantastic places to eat close by. And I promise you this place looks just like all the post cards. I really can't say enough good things Elias, I apologise this review is a little late, but again thank you for your hospitality, I truly hope others flock to the place to feel as special as you all made us. The highlight of our trip Thank you!!!",3
"From the 5 star breakfast to the personalized attention and breathtaking views, this was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at! Elias was courteous, attentive, and beyond helpful. Gabriela was kind, considerate, and extremely knowledgeable. The room was modern, clean, and hosted the best view to see the amazing sunset. The spa and pool was intimate and perfect. I cannot say enough good things about this place and if I visit Santorini again thisis the only place I'll stay! Perfect for romantic getaway, honeymoon, girls' spa trip, etc.",3
"This was my 4th or 5th visit to Santorini and I have never stayed in AM Oia Castle before. This time we stayed 4 nights here and enjoyed every single moment. From the initial contact Elias, our manager of the hotel, created a special atmoshere of welcome and caring. We stayed in Volcano room with fantastic view, remote from the noisy main street and just few meters from a great seafood restaurant. The room was very private and quite and you can watch the sunset sitting in jacuzzi. Breakfast was very nice, I requested some low lactose milk and they organized everything. Try oat meal, it's very tasty. All in all, hats off! You guys exceed expectations by far. If I can rate 10, I would do it.",2
"Where to start...my husband and I stayed at Oia Castle in May 2016 as part of our anniversary trip to Greece. We originally booked the Marine Honeymoon Suite but upon arrival, we were told that the cave jacuzzi wasn't operating. We were offered the Thalassa Honeymoon Villa instead, which turned out to be amazing. The Thalassa Honeymoon Villa is located in a different area of the caldera, away from the other Oia Castle suites. It was a bit more of a walk, but the privacy was much nicer. We had a perfect view from the outdoor jacuzzi to watch the sunset while most people were lining up in the nearby walkways to watch the sun set. Our balcony area/jacuzzi had an awning over it which made it nearly 100% private from onlooking passersby above us. It was very special.Each morning afforded us a complimentary breakfast at the Oia Castle kitchen, near the other Oia Castle suites. The breakfast was filling as you're permitted to choose an appetizer of sorts, a main breakfast entree and a breakfast dessert, along with coffee/juices. All of the staff was extremely friendly and willing to help us in any way during our stay. Elias went above and beyond in providing suggestions for dining, drinking and sight-seeing around the island. He even arranged for our rental car for us to drive around the island - after a mishap on our part, he still called the rental car company on our behalf to address it and work through the issue. Of course we could have done this on our own, but it is a perfect example of how helpful Elias and his team was. It made us feel so special and spoiled as this kind of experience was next to nothing we've ever experienced before.If you're going to visit Santorini, I recommend staying in Oia at Oia Castle. You get what you pay for, and that is an amazing, unobstructed view of the famous Santorini sunset along with the caldera. You will be within walking distance of the famous blue domes, many restaurants and shops. If you choose Oia, you should make the walk/trek down to Amoudi Bay. It's worth the effort for the view - if you continue walking to the left, you will be taken to a small area in which you can kick back and swim for a bit. There is even a little cliff of sorts to which you can swim and jump off into the crystal blue water.I digress, but hopefully it is evident of how special Oia is, and how well positioned you'll be to experience first-class service if you choose to stay at Oia Castle - you won't regret it!",2
This was our favorite hotel from our trip. Upon arrival and a young man met us to carry our luggage to our rooms. It is a little bit of a walk from where they drop you off. Well worth the walk. The views are amazing! Elias Constanteas was there to go over the hotel property with us and give us some great recommendations for places to eat and things to do. Everything he recommended was was exceptional! Thanks Elias! The room was so beautiful. It was our Anniversary so they had rose pedals on the bed and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. We had a private hot tub that had a view of the sunset. Wow! it was spectacular. The breakfast every morning was very good. The service was exceptional! We are coming back! This hotel is fabulous!,3
"Excellent view Excellent service and very good room. At the beginning we were bit nervous not knowing how the hotel would be but it turned out to be good choice the staff was very good, breakfast was excellent and awesome view.",3
"Well what a room, lovely location, one of the best to see the sunset from the deck above the room, indoor swimming pool and very clean. As people have mentioned no matter what room you get in Oia, if your looking for a sunset view to step out into, you will be overlooked to a certain point. This room is more open than others as the public path runs right next to it but it did not concern us at all. Actually around sunset you could see all the people looking very envious as we sat back on the loungers with a couple glasses of wine enjoy the sunset, while other along the paths and higher up were standing and looking rather hot and bothered ..:)Oia Castle is a boutique hotel in all the essence of the word. There is no bar, no swimming pool (shared) or any type of communal area...but i think thats a little bit of a bonus as it encourages you to experience the local offerings. Breakfast is served in a very nice restaurant (tiny) and is very personable. One thing to note, if you do not like steps and walking up them this maybe not the right choice. Even though the room is around step 240 of 275, its still a steep climb to the top and in the heat can be quite harsh...still a reward is a nice cold beer in one of the cafe's.Would i go back, probably not, why not? as i would probably go to the Aspaki which is the sister hotel of Oia Castle and we ended up there on checkout day as they needed our room back. Now we were only there for 4 hours or so, but the service, the friendliness and hotel itself were extremely accommodating and it was nice to get away from the crowds. They have a shared swimming pool and bar/restaurant area, which was fantastic. Both hotels are great. I would always go for the view of course as thats why you are in Oia to see the sunset, but if you have done that already and want something slightly different then this is the hotel you should go to (Aspaki). Everyone we met were brilliant and accommodating. One of the best boutique hotel's i have been to!..Excellent job guys.   Room Tip: higher rooms offer more privacy (not much though) See more room tips",4
"We went to Santorini for the Orthodox Easter, just at the beginning of the booming touristic season. First we booked the Oia Castle as the sister hotel Aspaki was not opened yet when we got there. The Oia Castle is just below the ruins of the Byzantine Castle, where all the crowds are coming to see the sunset. The balcony and the private jacuzzi ((very nicely hidden into a small grotto) are overlooking the Amoudi Bay with stunning vies especially during sunset. The guy form the front desk, Elias is a greek raised in Canada, therefore excellent English speaker, is a very nice, carrying, attentive and talkative person. He went the ""extra mile"" to make sure our stay in Santorini is perfect. He took care of the booking with the Catamaran and was extra-cautious checking the winds forecast so that our journey on the sea would be excellent. Despite all his efforts he could not keep the winds under control and we felt a bit dizzy at the end of the catamaran trip. But that's nature. Elias really did his best. Asa a matter of fact Elias went so far as to offer to move to the Aspaki suites which faces the Caldera, and this made our journey even more exciting. Aspaki is newly renovated, luxurious, and it is run by a very nice Romanian lady, Daniela. Daniela is very courteous, friendly and professional offering excellent advice about you would want to know, from curiosities like Japanese couples dressed in wedding suites coming to Santorini just for photo-shootings, to nice restaurants with excellent food. The room in Aspaki was spacious, dug into the rock like a small cave and has its own terrace and private jacuzzi. The jacuzzi is not that nice as the one in Oia Castle, but the view during the day is breathtaking. I highly recommend this hotel. It's a place where we will certainly come again.   Room Tip: Best vies over the Caldera from Aspaki and best sunset views from Oia Castle. See more room tips",2
"We stayed at the Aspaki in May and really enjoyed the hotel. Firstly the location is amazing and you really don't want to leave the room. The hotel is a small boutique hotel (it only has 9 rooms) with very personalized service to each guest. Breakfast was included in the room rate and we enjoyed something different from the menu each day and enjoyed beautiful views of the volcano, ocean and Oia. To experience the beautiful Oia sunset the hotel arranged for us to go to its sister hotel (Oia Castle) and view it from the terrace there. It was magical.The only thing to be aware of is that Oia is built on a cliff and you have to go up and down steep steps to get around. For us it was a good thing because it was a good workout.",3
"We stayed last week for 5 nights in Aspaki heaven, as we call this hotel my husband and me, in the new exclusive suiteIt was absolutely amazing, with total privacy, large space and luxury building jacuzzi. This people every year surprise us. I want to say more about this place, but I m still on holidays...!!!!!",2
"It's hard to find the right words for this expirence. You have to visit it by your owen.we've got a awesome room with a Jacuzzi right in front of the sunset! the room service was very properly and did a great Job!Mr. Elias Constanteas made our stay even more faboulus. He have great ideas for trips and organise every wish you have! Thank You, Elias!",4
They say the only sunsets worth seeing are on this side of the island and I would tend to agree...many places actually on the side are wonderful for the sunset which is the High Point of everyone's day here. It depends on what Cliff is jetting out to your left or to your right as far as your vantage view of the cauldron. It's lovely to walk in the evening and enjoy random restaurants and cocktails the weather was gorgeous.,6
"Great Cave pool room, Direct sunset views from Jacuzzi of Oia Castle and also access to sister property Aspaki with Blue domes view.Great restaurant recommendations and personalized servicewill come back again someday in future",5
"I simply do not know a word in any language that can describe this gem in Oia! But I will try my best. My back then boyfriend, who now is my fiance and I stayed at Oia Castle for 4 days. and let me tell you, I don't know how I will be able to stay elsewhere after living in Oia castle for 4 days.Hospitality of the staff is beyond!!!! They make you feel like king and queen. Anything you ever need they are there for you. They are also so friendly, made me feel like we've been friends forever. In addition, they know the island inside and out and will give the most amazing recommendations that only locals know about and no travel blog would. The rooms are spotless, romantic, beautiful and very unique. Breakfast every morning is complimentary and it's 5 course breakfast! Literally 5 course with home baked pastries and of course the Greek yogurt...My fiance proposed to me during our stay and I am extremely happy he picked Oia castle for this stay. Would not have ever imagined a better place. Elias, the manager of the hotel is such an amazing and kind person. he got us an upgrade to the honeymoon suit due to the occasion and our minds were blown away when we saw it. He was able to do the upgrade due to the honeymoon suit being available, of course. He is like a tour guide. he knows EVERYTHING about Santorini!This hotel is beyond beautiful with the best sunset view in town. People come all the way from Fira and other islands to look at the sunset from this particular spot in town where the Oia Castle is. And you can just sit on you balcony sipping champagne and enjoy the sunset.I cannot wait to plan a trip back to Oia and at Oia castle, of course.Oh! one more thing. We checked out at noon and they had to prepare our room for the next arriving guests and we had about 4 hours to spare and Elias simply put us into Aspaki, which is another property under the same management and that one was just as beautiful. The view of the Caldera was stunning, the pool is perfect size. you're just swimming and overlooking the blue domes and the Caldera in the Aegean sea. it's indescribable, must see it and experience yourself!You will be the happiest with your stay in Oia castle or Aspaki!!!We cannot wait to go back!Roupen & Alina   Room Tip: best views, best location, best staff, best hospitality See more room tips",5
"We stayed here during an island hopping trip and i have to say we were really happy with our choice! It all matched beautifully and the sunset was simply stunning...exactly like on the pictures! the rooms were big enough, tastefully decorated with stunning views! Opt for this hotel when is Santorini...it has a cozy vibe to it...I wish we could stay more",3
"This a great place to stay and I highly recommend it. The suit, the food, the pool area and the view was fantastic. The staff and service is out of the ordinary. We stayed at Aspaki for our honeymoon for seven nights and we couldn't have chosen a better place.",5
"From the moment we walked in we were accommodated and taken care of. The service was absolutely wonderful. We booked the atmospherico room for two nights and it was stunning. Aspaki has the best views in all of santorini. You'll see a whole bunch of people outside of the entrance of the hotel trying to take pictures of the view that the hotel possesses. Also, another point I found extremely valuable was our room had absolute privacy. Daniella was a gem, I am so glad we booked Aspaki for our anniversary trip in santorini. I still dream about the breakfast. Sohail and Farah Malek",6
"We've just returned from a wonderful holiday staying at the Art Maison, Aspaki Exclusive Hotel in Oia. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had nothing but friendly, helpful and professional service.I apologise in advance but this is a pretty long review as we wanted to highlight everyone's contribution in making this a fantastic holiday!We were lucky enough to have the top room, the exclusive Blue Suite, which had amazing views across the whole of the Caldera.The owner, Mr Dimitris, obviously takes great pride in his hotel which is totally deserved. Having said that, he is not a man to sit on his laurels and take things for granted. He takes time out to talk to his guests enquiring if there is anything that could be done differently to improve their experience.This now leads me on to the front of house staff, Daniela, the Manager and her assistant, Mina. They provide constant assistance throughout the day to ensure you have a lovely holiday. They will provide you with information regarding activities you might like to do, for example a tour of the island (if you do this ask for George to be your Driver if possible, he's superb) They will also provide you with restaurant recommendations and dinner reservations both in Oia and in other parts of Santorini. Their sunny dispositions just adds to the sunny atmosphere of Santorini!The food prepared by Dida is lovely, from a delicious omelette at breakfast to a delightful salad for lunch, everything is freshly prepared. If you are lucky enough to be offered some of her Carrot Cake, you must, it's simply the best! (Sorry Dida if we've just made more work for you). All the food is served to you by Andi who is both charming and polite and always happy to get you anything you want whether that be in the dining area, by the pool or in your room.Miranda always ensured our room was spotless, it was made up quickly but corners were never cut. Extra towels for the room or for use by the pool were always available.Last, but not least there is Samy who is always busy in front and behind the scene. From meeting you when you arrive to help with your cases to sorting out any problems you may encounter during your stay, he is always there to assist you.What a team! They feel like a family, and for the duration of your stay you feel like they have welcomed you in as one of their own.THANK YOU to everyone for making our Wedding Anniversary trip such a memorable one, Best Wishes, Lynne & Mark x   Room Tip: Room 101 has the best views but a little overlooked, for more privacy go for one of the lower rooms.

"Art Maisons Oia Castle is magnificent in every way. From the moment you arrive, Elias and his team treat you like a VIP. Well appointed and comfortable boutique hotel perched on the cliffs of Oia, provide the most spectacular views of the sunset and dining and shopping are just steps away. And don't miss breakfast! Anita greets you with a pleasant smile and serves you the best Greek delicacies.

"We have travelled over much of the world, but this hotel, without a doubt, is one of the most special.We stayed in the honeymoon suite, Sunset 5. Gorgeous, with a great balcony with a jacuzzi. The views are stunning. In fact, I believe the balcony on this suite has perhaps the best views of the sunset you will find anywhere on the island. And the sunsets here are gorgeous.The hotel is meticulously maintained, and customer service is nothing short of perfection. Elias, in particular, deserves special kudos.Don't miss the breakfast!And by the way, I don't give out that many glowing reviews. But this place is in a league of its own.A dream.",6
"We stayed for 4 nights at the Aspaki part of the hotel. You could see our room from all over Oia as it seems to be perched on the best spot in town overlooking the incredible views. The room was lovely but the huge balcony with hot tub and multiple seating areas made it very special. Oia is wonderful but it's made by the views and you won't find a better position to marvel at everything than here. The staff were amazing, Daniella was so helpful with everything, even reorganising our ferry when there was a strike and sorting out our travel at our next destination. Everyone was so genuinely friendly, they made our stay perfect.",6
"From our room we had a beautiful and amazing view; the location was perfect. From day one, Elias and all the team members were very professional and had always a lovely smile. It was an amazing week, despite the weather for the first days; but at least we got some warm sun and got tanned the last two days. We highly recommend Oia Castle. I would go back there If we ever go back to Santorini.   Room Tip: Amazing view and exceptional services See more room tips",8
"We had an amazing weekend thanks to Elyas (sorry for the spelling;), Sami & the woman preparing this huge & very good breakfast (forgot your name, so sorry...) ! The location for is perfect, specially for the sunset in the private Jacuzzi.Strongly recommended !",6
"My review is long overdue BUT, I still wanted to share any info/ thoughts I could remember.We went on our honeymoon in September 2015, Santorini was our second last stop of the trip. We were originally supposed to stay at Oia Castle Luxury Suites, but we were moved here to accommodate a furry friend we had adopted while in Mykonos. (which was unable to travel with us to the hotel at the time, so we didn't actually have it)Our room was beautiful, very clean and very big. We had a swimming cave in the room which was also very cool. It was my favourite room that we stayed in at all the hotels on our honeymoon. The view from our room was top notch. There was a little sitting area outside where we could look out onto the water. The chairs were very comfortable, clean etc.The food at the hotel was great. Having a vegan diet for myself there isn't always options BUT I found I could eat the most at our hotel as opposed to other restaurants in the area.The staff was so warm and friendly. Really welcoming and there to answer any questions you may have. You have access to watch the sunset at Oia Castle, there is a separate area which is gated and locked and has the most amazing view. This way you don't have to try and squeeze your way through the hoards of others watching.Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. I would go back there 100% if I were to ever go back to Santorini. You wont be disappointed if you stay at this spectacular place. It really just feels so magical.",3
"My husband got a great promotion at work and we decided to celebrate with 3 days at Santorini. We chose to stay at the Honeymoon Suite in Aspaki Exclusive Hotel. Although we’ve been married for many years, our stay felt like a second honeymoon and we wouldn’t realize how much we needed it, before this trip. The suite was beautiful! It soothed us and helped us relax and enjoy our brief stay there. We mainly spent the time in the hotel and walking in Oia, even reaching all the way to Thira once. We loved how we could dine in the privacy of our own veranda or how we could just sit back and gasp in the view of the caldera from within the hot-tub. The suite is lovely decorated and built on two levels, with the bed and small sitting room on the upper level and the bathroom on the second. I think that the gentle hospitality offered made us feel welcome and allowed us to unwind even more. Top stay in Santorini!",3
"We got married on June and two months later we started a honeymoon tour around Greece with one part being the world-famous Greek island of Santorini. Santorini is included in probably every list regarding its unique beauty and its signature breathtaking sunset and views. We stayed for 3 nights in a honeymoon suite at Aspaki Luxury suites and I have to admit that we just wanted more days there. First of all, we travelled there by airplane and the transfer service of the hotel made it super easy for us to get to our suite since they picked us up from the airport, carried all our stuff and make us feel special. The room was really magnificent and the Jacuzzi on our private balcony comprised my everyday couch. The views over the caldera and the volcano are magical but I won’t emphasize that much since as I see everybody understands that Santorinian landscapes and images are truly eerie. However, we also arranged a private yacht cruise around the island, the 4-hour sunset cruise, which is literally stunning. A great choice and not expensive. Generally, everybody was very helpful and kind and they welcomed us with a bottle of fine local wine along with a basket of fresh fruits. Absolutely recommended!",3
"I had never been to Santorini before and my first time in the island was the best! I was really lucky, as a friend of mine suggested to us the Aspaki Luxury Suites for our accommodation and at the end of our vacation I cannot distinguish the beauty and the uniqueness of the island with that of our exclusive suite. We reached Athinios port from Piraeus with no car, but we had arranged a transfer service with the hotel. They were there waiting for us, carried our luggage and got us literally on the doorstep of our suite. Very friendly, very kind and very helpful. This is how it gets done. As for the room, I have no words to describe it. The heated jacuzzi on the balcony along with the absolute privacy of our room made our stay phenomenal. I was relaxing while enjoying a world-famous scenery, special in every single extent of it. The panoramic view, the volcano, the eternal Aegean waters really make you feel like a god on the top of the hotel’s cliff. Amazing experience. Santorini & Aspaki blowed my mind!",3
"I have been to Santorini a couple of times and I won’t stop going from now and then since it is a great island; the best in Greece in my opinion and one of the most special in the world. I usually try to stay in different hotels and, even, places in order to meet new things and get to know more details about a destination. However, this time I chose last time’s hotel and that was Aspaki Luxury Suites. I once again stayed in a cave pool suite and its was what I really wanted. It’s one of those times that you catch yourself thinking of a destination and linking it to a specific accommodation simultaneously. Except for the amazing and super relaxing indoor swimming pool (with chromotherapy option as well), my favorite habit when I visit Aspaki is the private balcony with its lounge area. Enjoying the fresh air, the unique volcanic landscape with a glass, or better a bottle of wine along with my girlfriend in pure serenity and peace, is what I need the most in my vacation!",6
"Together with two friends of mine we booked a Junior Suite at Oia Castle Luxury Suites. The room was excellent, the staff was super friendly and the people of the hotel fulfilled all the reasons for which we booked at this hotel and Santorini in the first place. The concierge team of Oia Castle arranged 3 private yacht cruises, the sunset, the caldera and the Santorini exploration ones, and they were experiences of a lifetime. Generally, we visited the island because we heard about those cruises and for the wine tasting tours, something that was arranged also by the stuff of the hotel. The wines are world-class and the tours are very good. I think I read it in another review as well, but Santorini has a lot to offer in many ways. Of course, the high-quality of our hotel in terms of services and facilities made all these really easy.",4
"Three girls in a such romantic destination such as Santorini? Why not? Santorini in opposition to what it is believed is great in many ways. First of all you don’t need to be a couple to enjoy the breathtaking rare views the island offers. Moreover, you don’t have to be a couple to indulge into the luxurious comfort of Oia Castle outdoor spacious jacuzzi, at the very place we booked for our 3-night vacation last october to avoid the buzz and to reduce the cost. Santorinian nightlife is fantastic and the hotel offered a complete package of spa treatments, scrumptious breakfast, unique interior and exterior scenery and transfer services from Santorini airport (no duty-free in the airport premises!) to the doorstep of our hotel along with luggage assistance that we really needed. Simple fantastic! Santorini is not just for couples and we drunk many times on that!",5
"We visited Art Maison late September for three days, since we had some work on the island. We stayed at the Olympic Deluxe Indoor Pool Villa which was their most affordable for a group of five people. After check in we thought it would be a small, crowded ""suite"", like the many others on the island. Boy we were wrong! We didn't want anything else, but to stay in our suite! It was all we could ask for! The suite is super luxurious and it has a big indoor pool that is amazing for impromptu parties and creative brainstorming! The balconies and all areas are completely private and with direct view of the notorious sunset! We really enjoyed it and looked forward to returning every day after or scheduled meetings.   Room Tip: All suites have amazing privacy! See more room tips",7
"We could not be happier with the choice to stay here. We were initially scheduled for an indoor cave room that included a private outdoor hot tub as well, but the people who departed, left the pool door open their whole stay. Which meant the room needed to air for a few days to feel fresh again. The staff was very apologetic and gave us THE BEST room in the place. This was at the new hotel but we were sooo pleased with the room we couldn't be happier. Amazing views, amazing breakfast served in the restaurant/bar area - something the older hotel does not have. Which means more food options for the included breakfast to choose from. An outdoor pool is also there. Right in the middle of Oia, with again, the best views of those amazing white domes and the church with the bells you see in every picture. We stayed here for 1/2 hour stay and then switched to the honeymoon suite we booked for the second half at the Oia Castle. We loved this place too, smaller, but the best sunset view imaginable. Both times the rooms came with free sparkly. Both rooms had amazing outdoor jacuzzis. The Oia Castle honeymoon suite is a bit of walk to the main part of town (just a heads up), still much much more private than many other suites and the best views. You really can't go wrong with any of the rooms - but my personal preference now having seen all the rooms are the rooms with the outdoor pools/jacuzzis!!!",9
"I came in Santorini for the sunset views and Oia Castle has the best sunset views in santorini.I felt deeply in live with the views, the service and the beautiful cave pool in Aqua Suite.We had a jacuzzi on the balcony and two balconies which was perfect for sunset view.We recommend this hotel for the best sunset view in town and very good service.",7
"There is no girl in the world who would not enjoy a detailed romantic wedding in a top of cliff or something like that, looking the sun in the eye while sets or rises. No matter how much of a realist you are, it is inevitable that you will love it. We got married this September (in order to avoid the heat of Greek summer) at Aspaki hotel and this is something I will remember forever. We chose the wedding area of the hotel because it can host up to 30 people and we needed that amount of space. The whole context of Santorini is famous for a wedding and there is not much I have to add. Breathtaking views over the caldera and the volcano, endless blue as far as you can see and super romantic atmosphere. The thing that I want to stop and say a thing about, is the professionalism and the high-quality services of the staff helping us to organize and arrange the wedding. They all were legendary! And believe me we were not the easiest people to cooperate with. Everything we needed we just let them know and we had the wedding of our dreams!",7
"Since Santorini was one of the most famous places in Greece that none of us had ever visited, me and my girlfriend decided to fill this gap in our vacation to-do list. And I mention my to-do list because after visiting Santorini and staying at Oia Castle, it was renamed to a to-do-before-die list. I know that it's a cliche everybody to talk about the sunset of Santorini and how amazing is it, but, literally, there are no words to describe this direct view to the sunset from our room at Oia Castle hotel. It is breathtaking and this is not a metaphor. It it divine. Nature in full show off.We found Oia Castle hotel online and we made the reservation through the hotel's website which guarantees you the best price available. We stayed in a Cave Pool Suite and we were thrilled. The private heated swimming pool inside the room from where you could watch the sun goes down every night while enjoying a bottle of wine till dawn, was epic! The room was perfect, the architecture unique and everything was great. But the opportunity to look the sun directly at its “eyes” from your comfort of your room is unutterable.Next time, our stay will be in the Honeymoon Suite but don't say it to my girlfriend yet!",7
"Being to Santorini for our honeymoon was probably the best choice we made all this time we are together (better than the wedding too yes haha). Santorini gives you the perfect context, but you have to be in the right place(s) to enjoy all Santorini has to offer. And we hit the jackpot since we booked the honeymoon Villa of Oia Castle. The Villa is not located in the hotel but is about 500 meters away from the hotel, with its own entrance and its own outdoor king-size jacuzzi from where we had everyday discussions with the sun, as we came face to face several times with the world-famous sunset of Santorini. The inner space, as well as the balcony are literally huge, and the room includes spa treatments to relax to the maximum. Generally, the people of Oia Castle made us feel like king & queen rathen than two people in their honeymoon.",9
"We visited in early September for our honeymoon, first island stop. We were originally planning on staying at the Aspaki sister hotel, Oia Castle. After making the hike down to the Castle in nearly 100 degree heat, we headed back up to view Aspaki. Although the Castle was very charming and provided a unique experience, we decided to stay at the Aspaki. Thanks to Niko for making that trip back and forth with our luggage in that heat! Simply put, everything was PERFECT. From the view, to the service, the food, our suite... our expectations were more then exceeded. The entire staff was more then accommodating, even arranging for us to view the sunset from the Oia Castle in the original suite we had reserved, best view on the island!Some suggestions, take advantage of the delicious breakfast, as well as lunch at the hotel. One of the best Greek salads we had on our 2 week stay in Greece! The sunset catamaran was also a highlight of our trip. A great tour of the island and a lot of fun. We were so upset to leave. Our only regret was not staying in Santorini longer. Hopefully we will get to visit the Aspaki again!",9
"I will never forget the stunning views we had for a week in the blue room at the very top of this hotel. We literally had the best view on the entire island. Days spent lazying around, reading on the balcony looking out into the caldera. The ladies who cooked breakfast were so hard working & made sure everyone got exactly what they asked for. Cant wait to go back!",7
"Last August my boyfriend and me, decided to spend five days in Santorini to celebrate our first anniversary. We booked this Hotel from the internet, according some reviews about the location , and ...yes!!! It was a heaven!!!The views were absolutely picturles. The service and staff were excellent . The position of the the Hotel was exactly in the middle of the traditional village of Oia, surrounding of the best restaurants and galleries . We have the best view of the volcano and our cave pool suite was absolutely hanging from the cliffs. We will never forget this place. We will be back again...",7
"We booked long in advance in order to take advantage of their early birds offer and we were not disappointed after checking out prior our stay the higher rates. We decided to stay for a whole week and chose the Oia Castle for their sunset view. Sunset view is very popular and it is worth experiencing on your balcony or on your private pool rather than outside on the street at the pity of thousands of tourists stretching to take photos or videos. Our Aqua suite had a private indoor pool -we enjoyed it so much in the evenings and an outdoor small but very private Jacuzzi where we spent most of the day time and sunset time...gladly.Breakfast, service and Lia - if I can rate it fairly it would be 10 out of 10. We were invited by the manager to enjoy a drink by the main pool at their sister property Aspaki and then is when I realized this company reserved the best front seats to enjoy the landscape of Santorini. At some point we were so mesmerized by the calm atmosphere of Aspaki and the views that we requested to amend a little our stay and take advantage of our last 2 days at Aspaki.It is very different than Oia Castle, design is more minimal accentuating the white walls and sort of the high end cave like accommodation. The staff, very attentive and respectful with a smile on their face at all times and what was surprising was how pleased they looked when doing their jobs.We went on to take on a cruise around the island, we did the hiking and it was stunning and tiring but we reserved the dinners based on the suggestions of the front desk staff without any dissatisfaction whatsoever.I adored every aspect of our stay and we both wish to congratulate Art Maisons for a job well done!",6
"We have heared so many things about Santorini and we decide to spent our honeymoon in Oia Santorini. After a lot of research in the internet we choose Aspaki, a small Hotel in Oia. We do not regreated at all.The hotel offers the best views of Oia, volcano and caldera. The exclusive suite that we stayed for five nights in October, was amazing. The weather was fantastic, sunshine and not so hot. The staff of the hotel was very friendly and 5 star service.We defentlly recommend Aspaki Hotel for a honeymoon and will be back again.   Room Tip: book your room in advance See more room tips",6
"Located in the world known most romantic town of Oia Santorini, this magical hotel consists of suites with views that are a genuine feast for the eyes. The decor is modern yet sophisticated with a romantic charm. Furnishings and accessories are tasteful and our pool room was spacy and well appointed. The views are a blessing every day, from sunrise by the pool...we tried it once..absolutely stunning...to sunset at the sister property. We already miss the breakfast, the brunch by the pool and the delightful chatter with the young girls at the front desk. This property should not be missed.   Room Tip: the more expensive suites have the best view See more room tips",5
"There is really is no better location to see the breathtaking sunset in Santorini! Our room at Oia Castle was spacious and included a large balcony with jacuzzi. The views are are just indescribable -- the most beautiful I have ever seen! I would say that this was my most favorite place I have ever stayed. Moreover, the service and hospitality is unmatchable. A special shout-out to Leah who came by our room at sunset and asked if my husband and I wanted photos with the sunset. Thank you for the incredible experience and hospitality, Oia Castle! We hope to return somebody.",5
"I was really amazed by the hospitality and room facilities of Aspaki Hotel by Art Maisons. We booked last minute over the weekend and so glad we deed it. It was a short stay but nevertheless amazing... Cave pool suite with our own pool on the balcony, large sunbathing area and unobstructed caldera view and the village of Oia. Very clean, healthy oriented breakfast and truly fantastic staff. As a frequent traveler, I would vote for this among the top ten favorite hotels to stay in the world...",4
It was our anniversary and my dream to visit this island. Comparative to Mykonos and Paros this island stands out proudly among the other Greek islands. We booked the honeymoon suite in oia castle hotel and after a small incident with the power we were moved to their sister property Aspaki. It is a very exclusive location guared by a church on its right and front sit to sea volcano and blue domed churches.We were right in the heart of this town yet so perfectly secluded from the massive tourists and its crowded streets. We spent the afternoon by the pool and at evening we would visit the town or dine at one of the restsurants suggested by the front desk clerk. We enjoyed the first sunset at oia castle hotel which was a blissful event worthy of experiencing. We highly recommend this hotels so that your experience might be complete. My husband loved it and I was happy and hoping to return.,6
"We booked via booking.com a couple of honeymoon suites for our family get away and this time we chose Santorini Oia.Aspaki Exclusive Hotel came highly recommended and seemed to have raving reviews and it was better than what we expected. Service, very good local food and products, top amenities and we had massage in a cave which was absolutely amazing with stars lightning the white cave walls.Staff -no words to describe their genuine hospitality and easy to talk to, there was nothing we could complain or suggest.Keep doing what you are doing!There is not better location than Oia Castle Hotel for sunset and Aspaki Hotel for the blue domes, architecture and volcano views.",5
"I have read many excellent comments about this hotel but I want to make sure readers really understand that going to this place is a DREAM.I booked a surprise trip for my wife Birthday and choose Art Maison based in the comments from other travelers but also looking to the pictures posted in their website.Before arriving I was just dreaming to be inside Travel channel, but this time the dream became a reality.all what we have watched in TV admiring all those spectacular views and picturesque scenarios was now under our feet and eyes and we were real part of it!The hotel is one of the best location in Santorini both to admire sunsets and also to have privacy from the crowd, Aspaki clearly is newer and better located in terms of avoidance of the crowd. The crew at the hotel is charming and always trying to give their best to let you feel like home despite we are far away, the owner is a must talk person who will provide a lot of good information about things to do and culture of the island and how to spend at best your traveling time.Only suggestion for the hotel buy a better Espresso Machine...everything else is a dream.thank you for having given us a chance to experience your hotel and having made of our surprise holidays an unforgettable moment.All the bestGiuseppe and Alma   Room Tip: choose the corner rooms cause better view and more privacy.

"Utterly joyful experience at the Aspaki Hotel part of the Art Maisons collection. Our family of 3 were pampered to the core, from early morning delightful breakfast to concierge and service.We felt it was genuine hospitality which made all the difference. The two bedroom cave pool suite had 2 verandas, a heated pool on the balcony and all white carved walls.Very clean, it was serviced twice a day and there was nothing to fault the cleaning team.Aphroditi and Daniele were very pleasant and knowledgeable about everything available on the island. We followed their suggestions and ended up taking a private tour around the island and it was Perfect. We had barbeque and drinks, a lot of swimming and snorkeling and ended up watching the sunset from the boat.I definitely recommend this exceptional boutique hotel to anyone looking for 5 star experience and genuine hospitality.",6
"Our pool room was beautiful with a pool carved in the cliff overlooking the sea, with a view that could not be matched . The staff was exceptional from concierge who helped plan and make reservations for different activities until the cleaning and restaurant team. We chose Aspaki for its Premium location (next to Santorin’s icon blue dome chapel,modern designs and excellent reviews. On top of that we had abundant breakfast options and by far the most helpful and friendly staff. Our stay is one we'll never forget. Hope to return next July.

"Having just spent 6 nights here and it was truly an excellent experience. The service is immaculate and staff treat you like family, assist with every small request and with a smile. The rooms are clean and the views are the best on the island. Location is the best in Oia with amazing sunset views. Overall would frecommend without any hestitation thank you for daniella and afriditi for assisting with restaurants and transfers and all activities.   Room Tip: cave pool room is a nice personal touch, but the exclusive suite has the best views in santorini See more room tips",3
"We stayed at the Aspaki Suites for 3 nights in October. The hotel was excellent with great rooms and the staff was friendly and genuinely interested in making our stay great. The room had its own little plunge pool within a cave outside the door that was wonderful. Aspaki Suites has great views of the caldera but to get the perfect sunset view their sister hotel, Oia Castle, has a perfect setting with tables and chairs that allows you to avoid the huge crowd that gathers around sunset. The staff was helpful in recommendations and their made-to-order breakfast was one of the best I've had at a hotel. The staff at both hotels will do whatever they can to ensure you have a great vacation!",3
"Seriously the best overall hotel experience we have ever had. This was a 20 year anniversary trip to make up for our original honeymoon in Santorini that was marred by bad weather and disappointing accommodations, which made this trip all the more sweeter. I have to say that the key element of making this trip outstanding was our hotel manager Aphrodite. You will not meet a kinder, more knowledgeable, experienced hotel employee, who gently guided us to the best vacation experiences of our lives- including an unexpectedly wonderful day of touring the island with ""George,"" another wonderful and knowledgeable person with great storytelling ability regarding the fascinating history of Santorini. The room and setting are as great as you would expect being on the Santorini caldera, and the indoor cave pool was very romantic!   Room Tip: I don't think there is a bad room See more room tips",2
"We stayed at the Aspaki Suites located right in the middle of about 1.5 km long OIA village offering unimaginably stunning and unmatched views of the Village, the Caldera and the Sea. Thanks to the hotel management & especially Daniella Pop, the GM of the hotel, for upgrading us from OIA Catle to Aspaki and then to a Luxury Suite # 101 which made our trip memorable & unforgettable. The hotel & suite location was brilliant, right at the top of the mountain, with views of the beautiful OIA village spread on both sides of the property, Sea right at the front and the shopping street & restaurants just a few yards at the back. Even the bathroom window of the Luxury Suite offered beautiful views of the sea. It was a treat to watch the sunset at OIA from Aspaki Suites but in addition we were also provided the opportunity by the hotel management to watch the sunset from their sister property OIA Castle Suites which was also an unforgettable experience. The breakfast area also offered stunning views of the village & the sea. The spacious verandah of the suite with ample sitting space, day beds and a double jacuzzi further adds to your pleasure. We feel that our decision to stay at Aspaki Suites (located right in the middle of the village) instead of Katakies (located almost at one end of the village) was a right decision & strongly recommend that a Luxury Suite at Aspaki shall undoubtedly be everyone's first choice, if budget permits, at OIA. We look forward to be there at least once more in our life.   Room Tip: Suite at higher floor recommended to avoid climbing of stairs as there is no concept of elevators at... See more room tips",2
"I had the chance to select this beautiful place to spend my stay in santorini! When i arrived i could not believe that it was even better than i ever expected. . . I fell in love with aspaki and with thalassa, the views were the most privilleged ones in oia, the best spot for someone to watch the sunset! The suites were absolutely breathtaking, tranquility, style, luxury and islander simplicity all combined with an exceptional service. The people were trully kind friendly and helpful, i am proud to have such places in greece! Dimitris and his crew were exceptional hosts! Thank u for everything! Most definately a must visit",1
My visit in santorini was extraodinary!!! Aspaki was one of the most beautiful and dreamy places i have ever had the opportunity to visit!! Beautiful views ( best location in oia and believe me i had my share of travels in santorini!) wonderful people and service. Totally worth visiting!!!!!,1
"My wife and I stayed at Art Maisons Oia Castle for 4 nights on our honeymoon and couldn't have been hapier with our choice. We stayed 2 nights in the Aqua Suite and 2 nights in the Marine suite.The location is the best in Oia for views of the sunset and old village cave houses and windmills.The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and Lia (consierge) was always willing to help us with whatever we needed and gave us some great local tips for dining and sight seeing.Breakfast is nice and fresh, offering pasteries & bread (the spinach pies are great), a choice of apetizers including Greek salad, Tsatziki or Olive dip (if there's two of you, share a sald and dip), traditional Greek style eggs (either boiled or scrambled), and fruit salad or a local delcacy of sweet grapes and yoghurt (so good!). Cereal was also available if you wished.Aqua Suite:This is an amazing suite offering your own private indoor pool and no less than three terrace/balcony areas including a small dining area right outside the door (perfect for morning coffee), a delightful sunset viewing terrace (for evening drinks) and a comfortable jacuzzi terrace below which was shaded and private (also great for sunset viewing). The suite has a good sized kitchenette complete with oven and stovetop but we were suprised that there where no cooking implements to use; however I'm sure Lia would have arranged some if we desired.The cave pool in the Aqua suite is a fun experience but do be mindful to keep the bathroom door closed (as advised by Lia) to avoid the suite becoming humid. The Aqua suite jacuzzi temprateure was set a little too low for the October temperatures but would have been fine for the hotter mid-summer months.Overall, the Aqua suite was spacious, comfortable and well worth the extra cost if you're looking for something a bit larger and homely than your normal hotel room.Marine suite:What a delightful room! The decor was warm and inviting with just the right balance of form and function including the best view from a shower ever! The thing we liked the most about this room was the aspect of the windows which opened to stunning views of the sea, Thirassia, sunset and Amoudi bay below, and allowed the Agean breeze to drift in whilst still being private and secluded. Waking up and gazing at the view from bed was a special moment.The Jacuzzi terrace for the Marine suite is also a highlight, offering a good sized sun lounge for reading and relaxing and with the Jacuzzi placed in a delightful cave which framed the sunset and ocean views perfectly. Overall, we liked the Marine suite best for it's coziness and decor, but it could have become a bit too small if we had stayed longer than 2 or 3 nights in it.We highly reccommend Art Maisons Oia Castle if you're looking for a touch of luxury in OIa and your budget permits. Thanks to Lia and all the staff for making the start of our honeymoon such a memorable experience.The Aspaki property also loks great and seems to be even higher on the luxry scale, offering Caldera views rather than sunset views.   Room Tip: Aqua suite is large and the pool is a great novelty. Marine suite is beautiful and has a great view... See more room tips",1
"We just returned from 5 wonderful days in Oia. We were initially going to stay in Oia Castle honeymoon suite and were upgraded to Aspaki, an exclusive suite. What a view! Everything was wonderful. Breakfast every morning, our jacuzzi on our balcony. I cannot say enough about how great our experience was.   Room Tip: Wonderful view in exclusive suite See more room tips",2
"We stayed for 2 nights at Aspaki honeymoon suite by the main pool and late evening it was litteraly our own private pool. We had a late swim, the water was warm and we enjoyed the views under the pleasant/romantic moon light.Breakfast was a feast every morning and the crew at Aspaki are very pleasant and very friendly and always smiling. We used the terrace at the Castle to watch the sunset and I admit Aspaki and Castle have the best views on the island.   Room Tip: we loved our honeymoon suite no 4 right next to the pool See more room tips",1
"That was the first time we visited Oia and we stayed at oia castle. It was the most wonderful experience we ever had!!! Everything was excellent, the villa, the view, the pool, the weather!!! We stayed in Aqua Cave Pool Suite and we had the best sunset view from our spacious balcony!!! We recommend this villa for everyone who likes privacy, view and luxurious stay!!!!!",1
"We just returned from 3 days in Oia and I cannot say enough about the amazing experience. From the time we booked at Arts Maisons, there was plenty of communication and coordination from them. They arranged a pick up from the airport and greeted us at the car, which is great, because we never would have been able to find them! Our suite was at the end of Oia and extremely private. While there was only 2 of us, you could have had 5 people in the room. It was extremely large and recently opened. There was a dining table for 8 in the room and it barely filled the space. The deck was breathtaking, it was like you were on a private boat. Plenty of room to lounge in chairs or a lounger, with amazing views. You had your own pool underneath the deck which also had separate views. Very secluded and peaceful. Every night we had our own sunset view. Lia at the front desk was amazing, she gave great recommendations for dining and made sure we were taken of. The bed was also one of the most comfortable beds I have found in a hotel. Just amazing!   Room Tip: Ask for the Aqua Cave Pool Suite See more room tips",1
"First, the Oia Castle has the most incredible team of people working there. Lia at the front is so sweet and accommodating. Not only that, they are kind and we ran into them several times outside the hotel and each time we were addressed with Mr. and Mrs. Our room was upgraded from a Junior Suite to a Honeymoon suite with a hot tub facing the sunset. On our 3rd day we went to Aspaki the other property, and had breakfast there, it was excellent (as was the breakfast at Oia Castle). We tried lunch at Aspaki on Day 2, it was very nice as well. After our visit to Aspaki, Lia gave us the option to go stay at Aspaki for one night in the Honeymoon suite if we wanted to since they had availability (no additional charge). Never have I found such incredible customer service and attention to detail. They did everything they could to ensure we had the best stay. We will definitely go back to Oia Castle! Keep in mind, Oia Castle is located on what I considered the ""local"" side of Oia, we loved the charm of that part of town as opposed to many of the other upscale hotels which are located on the ""trendy"" side of town. Since we were right above Amoudi Bay, we saw the most beautiful sunsets!   Room Tip: best views, outdoor space See more room tips",1
"My wife and I spent a week of our honeymoon in Santorini, and we're lucky enough to stay at Art Maisons Oia Castle. As many other reviewers mentioned, Lia and the rest of the Oia Castle staff provided amazing service and made sure our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Our rooms were always cleaned and tidied, breakfast was great (make sure to try to yogurt with grapes) and Lia knew our schedule better than we did, anticipating transportation needs before we even thought to ask about them. Oia Castle really stands out for its unique and unsurpassed view of the famed Oia sunset. Other travelers would come from other towns on Santorini, and even other parts of Greece, just to see the sunset. While hundreds of tourists squeezed shoulder to shoulder starting 45 minutes before the sunset, we enjoyed an unobstructed view from the jacuzzi on our private terrace (it's more than a mere balcony) while enjoying a bottle of wine. While we had initially scheduled a few dinners with a sunset view, and went on a sunset cruise, we soon learned that there isn't a better view on the island, and had Lia reschedule our remaining reservations to allow us to enjoy the sunset from our suite. I can't recommend Oia Castle enough, and can't wait to return.",1
"More than 3 months have passed since we returned from our vacation in Santorini and beautiful memories linger.. It was my third time in Santorini after more than 8 years and it was like discovering a new island,a booming with tourism, new amazing hotels, bars, restaurants and fancy shops and galleries. What used to be a beautiful island transformed into something very glamorous. Oia it is the best part of Santorini and our stay in Aspaki was perfect. Service 5 stars, views unbeatable and the suites just splendind, we stayed in a pool suite with pool on the balcony.The staff and food-amazing, very clean and very spacious balconies, we had two balconies.We will return.",1
"at the very top you can locate the exclusive suite 101 which has a fabulous balcony with large Spa Jacuzzi.Our short stay was the pick of our stay in Santorini. We stayed in Imerovigli and we loved it only when we came to Oia we understood all the fuss about this town....it is picture perfect from every angle and our balcony had it all. Yes, at our feet the sea and some island popping from the sea and mostly used for cliff jumping, on the right the blue dome churches and only during 1 afternoon we witnessed at least 5 wedding shoots taking place at the entrance of this hotel....just so you figure how popular spot that is...Staff are very pleasant to converse with always smiling and utterly helpful. Concierge was excellent, the best service so far we had in Europe, we took a private guide around the island and instead of 5 hours we turned it into full day experience. The guide George was perfect......do not miss his excellent knowledge and love for this island....Breakfast was a delight, the noon snacks on our balcony were simple yet very delicious.I will return for sure and I am not skipping this hotel   Room Tip: we stayed in exclusive 101 and we had the best experience ever, we didn't see other rooms See more room tips",1
"Tremendous experience of a life time in the picturesque town of Oia. The views, the amazing accommodation, the friendliness and hospitality of the entire team that work here - they made us feel welcome and treated us so well. They went out of our way to accommodate us bringing our 18 month old daughter (even buying a crib for us to use??!) and anything and everything we needed was provided. HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to fully enjoy this amazing island.",1
"Oia Castle is an amazing hotel. Watching the sunset each night from your private balcony could not be beat. The room was large and well appointed. The balcony jacuzzi was a great way to end the day with while enjoying the incredible view. As incredible as the hotel/view are the staff are even better. From the bellhop that carried our luggage from the shuttle up and down the many steps, to the amazing breakfast staff everyone was very eager to make our stay special. In the hotel office Lia went above and beyond to help us with anything we needed. From making restaurant recommendations and reservations to helping us book an ATV for the day, she helped make Oia and incredible stop on our vacation.",1
"Yes, this is primarily a hotel for couples and honeymooners, but my friend and I stayed here as a treat to ourselves in the final leg of our 3 week vacation. The service was impeccable. Lia at the front desk was amazing - so kind, helpful, and attentive to our needs and interests. The staff is really on point, I've never been in such a clean hotel room - every inch was spotless. Even the little corners which some hotels take for granted thinking you won't look there... It was Clean. The cleaning staff even did our dishes (which I wasn't even expecting), so a huge thank you for that. The kitchen staff and the luggage staff, everyone was amazing. Location was phenomenal, we didn't have to go far to see the sunset just watched from our balcony jaccuzzi - the jaccuzzi could be a little hotter, but I wouldn't hold that against them because we just had to ask and it would be done. It can be a bit tricky finding your way back to the hotel when you've gone out, look for the staircase that leads you to where it says ""Helios"" on the wall. This is the also the only staircase leading down to Ammoudi bay ( that i know of). Our experience here was so good, it was just the perfect end to a great adventure. When I return I would definitely stay here again (honeymooning or not) and I 100% recommend it to anyone visiting Santorini. It's worth every cent.",1
"The staff were very helpful and friendly. Sunsets were spectacular. The room was uniquely carved into the cliff with nice views and a kitchen. Hundreds of photos were taken by other travelers within a few meters of our patio affirming the attractiveness of the location. If you want privacy in Oia, that's quite a challenge due to the cliffside nature of accommodations. The also available to us Aspaki location was superb for midday sun and lunch due to its location out on a point. Spectacular! Steps are challenging in Oia and not suitable for those with mobility issues.   Room Tip: Aspaki is more private. Not sure about other Oia Castle rooms. Our spa was outside and one had an...

The hotel staff is extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about Santorini and the other surrounding islands. The rooms are all white and kept clean. The hotel is short walk (5mins or less) to Kamari Beach (black sand beach). On our third day the hotel upgraded our room for FREE. I definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Santorini.,0
"Hotel is a great btq hotel. Upon arriving one of the staff at the front desk sat with us and went over the map of the town, excursions and was truly helpful throughout our entire stay with the utmost sincerity. the rooms were clean, unique and comfortable, breakfast was a full buffet with lots of choices. Two pools, great location in town and down the block from the beach. This was a great find and we will stay there again when we return. I cant say enough about the staff!   Room Tip: we had three rooms one was a honeymoon suite, not really for a honeymoon but with a hottub, canopy... See more room tips",0
The hotel is gorgeous - the pools are smaller in person but still lovely and great for dipping. Excellent breakfast; very attentive staff. Clean rooms. And it's only a 5-minute walk to the beach and to the local bus stop for Fira. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone headed to Santorini.,1
"The Cavo Bianco is a perfect oasis in the midst of Kamari. All the staff are superb. The ladies on reception were faultless, Effi couldn't do enough for us. The whole ambiance of the hotel is calm. The rooms are extremely clean and minimalist in their decoration which is very effective. The beds are so comfortable! The room has plenty of hanging space. The bathroom is very attractive, modern and spotless.The pools are small which is perfect for cooling off from the heat of the sun but not suitable for families with kids to play in all day. There is no garden to speak of, just the breakfast terrace, sunbed terraces next to the pools which is perfect as nothing is too far to go. There is only one slightly disappointing factor which is the gym. Its very small and the equipment is old and not effective. The Beauty Therapist in the Spa is a superb masseuse. We had the most relaxing week at the Cavo Bianco and can totally recommend it.",0
"We stayed a whole week in Cavo Bianco. Great service, beautiful rooms with a private jacuzzi. Breakfast is nice (quite similar every day though). Customer service is high, we had 2 trips organized (to Ioa and to Fira). Both restaurants chosen were fantastic. We strongly recommand this hotel in Kamari.",0
"From the minute we chose Cavo Bianco & Booked to celebrate my Daughter's Wedding in Santorini to the day we left , cannot fault the staff or the Hotel . We emailed them as we were a large party & my mother has mobility problems .. Immediately we were informed my parents would be in a Ground floor room . We asked to be collected from The Airport again the Transport was arranged & waiting . The Rooms we're spotless clean . The Breakfast was fine large choice every morning . The Staff could not do enough for you , they seemed to be there 24hours a day always with a friendly smile . As there were no Hairdressers near they organised last minute on a Sunday for a Hairdresser to come to my Room to do my hair for the Wedding . They also put my Daughter & Son in Law in the Honeymoon Suite on their wedding Night ! The Location was great ! Opposite the Day Trip pick up points to being a few metres from Tavernas , Bars, Beach and Outdoor Cinema . Amazing place with amazing staff",0
"That is a true 5 start hotel!Great stuff, great atmosphere and great rooms, location is superb as well.Very clean and top notch maintained.Near buy stores and car/scooter rental.Thank you for great vacation :-)   Room Tip: Each room is has a different design, but all rooms are great! See more room tips",0
"The hotel is located in Kamari which is a smaller town which has a beach. Kamari is less touristy than Oia and Fira and therefore a bit quieter. We really liked the location as the other towns felt overwhelming. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They have great recommendations on what to see and where to eat. Honestly all the meals in the island were really good.The breakfast was included and it was really great. The fresh fruit was actually flavorful and the selection changed every day so we didn't get bored by eating the same scrambled eggs morning after morning.There are two pools in the property and you can choose to have lots of sun or not too much.Everyone in the property was smiling and greeted us nicely, they were extra happy and playful around our 8 month old son.At night we enjoyed walking by the beachfront which was a couple minutes away from the hotel.The rooms were very clean and modern and fairly quiet at night. We used the private jacuzzi once at night, it was a bit cold but with the hot Santorini nights it was refreshing. I'm not sure we'd go back to Santorini, but if we did, we'd definitely stay at Cavo Bianco again.",0
"This hotel made our wedding stay with all our guests so memorable and lovely, it the best hotel ive stayed in definitely 5 star! the place is immaculate, we stayed in room 214 a suite that had jacuzzi and glass panelled higher level for the bed, top spec bathroom, fridge wardrobe, sofa bed, etc. The staff are literally amazing I have never been to a hotel where every single person was so friendly attentive and helpful nothing was a problem for them, so Thankyou again Effie, Vicky, sia, Geri, michalis and dionisis you all work such long hours and never stop always with a smile always on your face! The hotel has two beautiful pools with spotlights in the floor so sparkle at night, the pools were sometimes so quiet it was like having a private pool, some of our guests had the ground floor rooms over looking the front pool so they could relax on their balconys and watch the kids in the pool, the double beds were a touch of luxury to sunbath on and nice touch when the staff bought round cold flannels to cool you down or ice buckets to keep your drinks cold. The air con worked brilliant, if you needed an iron you could ask at reception there was a hairdryer in room with some lovely toiletries, the beauty treatments offered in the spa downstairs are a nice treat. My mum booked the private pool room which was good for my little girl to play in whilst we got ready, The food was nice served in hotel and the breakfast was always fresh and plenty of choice, if you book here you will have a very enjoyable stay!! Seriously the best holiday we have had! And all our guest agreed so not just us! Getting ready there on my wedding day was lovely only thing missing was a full length mirror in the rooms maybe something management could add for us girls, and few portable umbrellas as there is not much shade at the pool lol. The staff have us upgrade of the honeymoon Suite for our wedding night was such a lovely personal touch as they gave us complimentary fruit wine and laid our petals and candles in shape of love heart that goes beyond what is expected and made our day all the more special. The hotel is so close to everything and at the bottom of the hill so no steep walks. Bus service is good as taxis get quite expensive as are food and drink around Santorini so be prepared to bring a lot of euros but the scenery and views are definitely worth it breathtaking' and the Greek people could not have been more welcoming and friendly to us everywhere we went! When you see the photos and how amazing they are they are true to likeness and the place is even more better in real life!!",0
"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff, great rooms, super clean, close to the beach, so relaxing and great value - a definite recommendation!Thank you Cavo Bianco team for being so fantastic - we cannot wait to come back next year!",0
"We stayed here for two nights during our honeymoon. We had chosen the hotel based on the photos and reviews and chose a room with a hot tub. From arriving at the hotel it was 5star service. With our bags being taking in, complimentary room upgrade to a honeymoon suite and a bottle of wine. The staff were lovely, and gave us all the information we needed about the area aswell as suggestions for restaurants which turned out to be very good! Couldn't fault the staff in anyway. Great service! The room was lovely and the hotel itself was very modern and new. I even had a massage which again was well worth the money. Pool area again well kept and nice with 4 poster beds to lie on. No issues at all about getting sun loungers. We did say that we could have stayed longer here as it was so nice. If we do return to Santorini this would definitely be a hotel that we would stay in again!",0
"this hotel deserves 5 stars rating in all terms. very clean, comfortable beds and amazing and simple furnished. We had our honeymoon there and we are so thankful for the staff for their help and support.",0
"one of the best place I have stayed.. I have travel around the globe for last 25 years and stayed at top notch hotels and this by far was one of the best , front office girls Effie and Viki are best always ready to help with smile , room are very clean and super spacious , love it will come back again   Room Tip: must take bus tour there is travel agency 10 step from hotel entrance they have bus and boat tour See more room tips",0
"Recently stayed at the Cavo Bianco for 7 days, we were picked up from the airport by the staff who from the start were very friendly and could not do enough for us.Arriving at the hotel it looks cute with its white walls and chic signage.One thing that immediately disappointed was the size of the swimming pool's they are quite narrow and not for swimming and more for dipping your feet in!Inside the hotel we were greated by more friendly staff, welcome drinks & a detailed map tour of the island.The hotel is cute, the rooms were nice but on the small side - great aircon! Personally I found breakfast disappointing and a little difficult to stomach at times- fish fingers &vegetables were one of the dishes amount the buffet style breakfast. Hotel bar is overpriced!Location is about a 5 minute walk into the beach front/bars, just dont wear heels.Overall the staff made the hotel, the really were so helpful & knowledgeable of the island.",1
"Thought it's not located on the beach, the Cavo Bianco is a cute, modern boutique hotel, perfectly situated, if you want to be close to the beach but not directly on it. The staff was nice, the breakfast was good and the access to the Kamari Beach boardwalk was great. The only drawback was the pool area. The image is a bit deceiving. The pool area and pool are fairly small and right at the front of the hotel.",0
We stayed at Cavo Bianco for five nights during our stay on Santorini. The hotel is fabulous and great location. Our room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. If the pillow doesn't suit you they have a menu of pillows you can select from - a nice touch. The staff is super and extremely helpful. Everything we asked for they responded in a very fast and professional manner. The breakfast buffet was top notch - I could've eaten there all day! ;) Cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel (and also Kamari!).,0
"We spent a weekend there and it was great! The staff was very kind the explained everything to us and gave us restaurants recommendation. We had a great time :-). The hotel is clean, the room we have been to was small but it was OK.",0
"My husband and I only spent one night at Cavo Bianco but I honestly wish we could have stayed longer to fully enjoy the beautiful pool area and spa. This small boutique hotel is clean, beautiful and only a few minutes walk from Kamari Beach. The hotel staff was warm, friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate our late check-out time. The hotel breakfast was included and absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this hotel.   Room Tip: The loft style room was a fun departure from a traditional hotel room. See more room tips",0
"The staff and hotel are great. They have two small pools ,a pool bar and very well kept grounds. The staff is always on point and help with everything from reservations to tours. The location is a 3 minute walk to the beach and in the middle of shops and restaurants. We travel a lot and this is a nice small hotel. I would stay here or any other Cavo hotel again.",0
"Our family had a lovely holiday at the Cavo Bianco in July 2016. The staff at the hotel we very helpful & friendly. Some were exceptional. The rooms were furnished to a high standard & kept spotlessly clean. The location is great for Kamari beach.The buffet breakfast was good if slightly limited & it took some instructions to get a good cup of coffee. However, the gym is tiny & the equipment & weights are inadequate for any kind of complete workout. The pool area is beautiful but the size of the pools are tiny & not big enough for a swim.",0
"The hotel is beautifully designed, clean, and very welcoming. The staff is very accommodating and pleasant, the breakfast buffet - rich, fresh and tasty. The hotel is located a minute's walk from the beach and boardwalk and is highly recommended.   Room Tip: ask for a pool view See more room tips",0
Stayed here for two weeks whilst getting married in Santorini. Simply amazing stay. Staff were wonderful and so helpful in everyway possible. Rooms were perfect. Cannot state enough how brilliant my wife and I found the Cavo Bianco. Would recommend to everyone.,0
"This is our first time in Santorini., and we have made the perfect choice of choosing Cavo Bianco for our honeymoon stay! The staff are all wonderful and so nice, that's what you call customer service! We are bummed that we only had a short stay, but we are definitely coming back and will still choose Cavo Bianco for our hotel! It has the perfect location, not along the shoreline but just 5mins walk from all the restaurants, stores and of course Kamari Beach! Thank you Cavo Bianco for making our Santorini stay wonderful!",0
"My wife and I only stayed here for 3 nights but it was the perfect start for our honeymoon. The hotel was gorgeous and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was always cleaned very well and the breakfast was perfect as well. It's located in Kamari and is very close to many restaurants, the beach, and a bus stop across the street. We HIGHLY recommend staying at Cavo Bianco if you visit Santorini.",0
"We stayed here in July 2016 and had a fantastic time - the hotel is understated, very modern stylish with clean lines that look great against the blue skies. Immaculately clean, plenty of attention to detail, perfect location in Kamari. We would recommend Kamari as although not as picturesque as Oia & Fira, you can walk in to any restaurant, the beach is lovely and on your doorstep and it's a hell of a lot quieter than elsewhere on the island, which are still only 20-30 mins away. Best thing about the hotel were the staff, Geri the barman/waiter/bell-boy in particular who was always on hand to help us! We also loved the high quality beds & the wonderful pool-side relaxing areas, you reall don't need to do anything!Overall, would highly recommend and hope to come back!",1
"It is located in Kamari and very close to the beach. Less than hundred metres is the vibrant town centre where there are more than 25 restaurants. The public car park is just walking distance. The building is very well maintained and exceptionally clean. The breakfast is full of choices and is definitely the highlight of our stay. The 2 pools are very well maintained and has a tranquil atmosphere. The staff members are very polite and always willing to serve with a smile and that does make a hell of a difference. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern.A bit pricey but definitely worth it. Our special thanks to Effie, Gery, Cia, Vicky and Michalis. Best wishes.   Room Tip: Jaccuzi is not available in all the rooms. See more room tips",1
"We stayed at the Cavo Bianco in mid June for 2 weeks, this is the first time we have stayed in a small hotel on a bed and breakfast only. We normally stay at couples hotels which are much bigger and on a half board basis. This hotel is much better than any of the others we have stayed at. We stayed in a junior suite which had a hot tub on the balcony. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed really comfortable the balcony area was quite large and the hot tub was a lovely feature although we only had it heated up a couple of times as the weather was very hot so it was nice to be able to use it to cool down. The service from all of the staff was amazing, nothing was too much trouble for them. The reception staff Effie, Sia and Vicky were simply the best reception staff we have ever come across, they were always so helpful and friendly, they helped us hire a car and showed us the best places to visit. The bar staff and waiters Michael and Geri were really friendly and so helpful and Natalia kept our room so beautifully clean, all of the staff are a real asset to the hotel they make sure your stay is perfect. The breakfast was excellent lots of choice and variety. We hired a car for 6 days and travelled around the island, so worth doing as there are many places to visit. Oia was lovely as was Thira and the sunset was magical. The hotel is in such a good position with many tavernas all on the doorstep and the beach just a 5 minute walk away and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel. We are glad we chose Kamari as it is a lovely place to stay and very reasonably priced. We would recommend a visit to Gavalas winery which is in the small village of Megalochori which also has a lovely restaurant called Feggara the food there was lovely, although the to be fair we tried many tavernas in Kamari and all were really good. If we ever visit Santorini again we would defiantly stay at the Cavo Bianco.   Room Tip: Room 121 or any junior suite See more room tips",0
"There is nothing to dislike about Cavo Bianco and just wish our stay there had been longer.The staff are fantastic and can't do enough to make you feel welcome and in our experience were fantastic throughout are stay.If you are looking for a wonderful time then this hotel, resort and island will not disappoint.   Room Tip: We stayed in a senior suite (own outdoor Jacuzzi) and a pool room suite, both great but really nice... See more room tips",0
"We stayed here in June 2016 for our wedding and two family holiday. We arrived late at night and had a warm and friendly welcome, treated to wine by the pool while our bags were taken to our rooms. Lovely and quiet. When ready we were shown to our room which was a superior room, we were very happy with everything, great size clean and fresh style. The staff were helpfull and friendly over our whole stay, the service was great. The location was right next to some of our favourite places to eat Danas taverna and taverna Salada and a bus stop, with a short walk to the beach. I love Santorini and I miss it already. <3 xxx",0
"Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Cavo Bianco but experienced a number of minor annoyances. The Cons:- The Senior Suites include a private pool (which is a nice touch) but the water is not heated and was still quite cold in late May.- The Wi-Fi reception was inconsistent.- The room design favours aesthetics over practicality: ~ the bed is up on the loft level while the TV is down on the main level meaning it is not possible to watch TV in bed. ~ in place of a shower curtain there is a glass panel but the panel is only half the length of the bath tub so the floor of the bathroom gets very wet during a shower. ~ the ""do not disturb"" sign is an ornament which seems quaint until you use it and are unable to close the door due to the width of the ornament.- The hotel facilities also have some issues: ~ the larger of the two swimming pools is right next to the main road and can be noisy when there is traffic; while the smaller pool (around the side of the hotel near the restaurant and bar) is very small and hardly ever used (at least in May). ~ the exercise room in the basement is an embarrassment (old, broken, squeaky equipment) and the hotel should probably update it or stop drawing attention to it.The Pros:- the hotel offers arriving guests a welcome drink and is a short walk from the boardwalk restaurant area- the young staff perform multiple jobs during the day (bellboy, bartender, light maintenance) and are helpful- the loft style Senior Suites are very spacious with a very comfortable bed- the hotel provides hard soap bars and 'individual toiletry' bottles (rather than large reusable bottles of shampoo and soft soap)- breakfast was very extensive with a good variety of both hot and cold selections- the large swimming pool has a few cabana beds (at no extra charge) which are relaxing on a sunny dayIn summary, although each of the annoyances was small, when they were added together it left us with the impression that the hotel wasn't quite worth the premium cost.Our rating of 3.7 rounds up to an integer 4.",1
"From the moment the hotel staff greeted us at our taxi, and refused to let us carry the bags, we knew the hotel's reputation for great service was well deserved. Our host, Effie, checked us in efficiently, and then sat down with us to explain the hotel amenities, the attractions of Santorini, and her tips for enjoying our visit to this island paradise. The hotel has a book showing various options for tours, restaurants, and other features. She recommended a tour by water, and once we settled on one of the many options, she booked a sailboat tour that fit our schedule.Effie showed us to our room, and surprised us with a one-night upgrade to a room with a private pool and a loft. Then she sent a delicious fruit salad and bottle of wine, and urged us to just relax and enjoy a quiet evening and we did.Breakfast was fantastic, with a large variety of fresh baking, fruit, meat, eggs, cheeses and more. Food was replenished rapidly and efficiently.The famous Kamari black sand beach is about a ten minute walk from the hotel, and the staff supplied us with towels for the beach, the pools and the jacuzzi suite that we had booked. The jacuzzi tub is outside on a private patio and can be kept cool for hot days or warm for cooler days. The two main pools offer sun or shade at different times of the day, and one pool has a gradual slope entry that is perfect for small children.We regret not having scheduled spa services, as the hotel offers complete spa services by appointment.Rooms were very comfortable, with high quality bedding, and spotless housekeeping. The hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood, with restaurants, and interesting shops, including an interesting pottery shop next door on the street leading down to the beach.The ruins of Ancient Thira are a short drive or moderate hike up the mountain from the hotel. The entire staff treated us like family for our seven-day stay, and always asked us about our day, and our travels whenever we entered the hotel. At the end or our stay, it felt like we were leaving family behind as well - I don't remember staying in another hotel where we hugged the staff on our departure! I would highly recommend this hotel for a honeymoon or an anniversary trip like ours, or for young families. We will definitely stay there again when we return to Santorini.   Room Tip: The jacuzzi suite room was perfect - in a quiet location. See more room tips",0
"We visited Cavo Bianco for our honeymoon and we cannot praise the hotel enough it’s an absolute gem. It’s chic, gorgeous and all white, which is what we wanted for our visit to the land of “white and blue”. Just a short walk to Kamari beach for a great choice of restaurants, bars etc whilst managing to remain a quiet and calm oasis. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left Effie and her front of house team offered totally amazing service with nothing too much trouble and we had lots of request for restaurant bookings etc! Geri the barman was totally charming and attentive at all times. Actually, all of the staff simply could not do enough for us, the customer service is totally five star.We had the honeymoon suite (obviously!) with a four poster bed, which was divine, so comfortable and the bedding was of high quality. We didn’t have a Jacuzzi on the terrace or an outside pool which may be our only tiny criticism as the balcony is big and gets the sun all day, so it would have been nice to use it more. The sunken jacuzzi in the room was a nice feature but personally would have preferred a free standing bath? The hotel is kept beautifully and to a very high standard and the outside areas are really lovely. Our only comment would be that the half chair/half loungers around the pool bar look good but serve no purpose and large sofas or more sunbeds would be more practicable (we did put this on our feedback form) as it’s such a nice area to relax in. Mind you it meant we more or less had it to ourselves so maybe I shouldn’t say too much! On our original search for a honeymoon to Santorini we wanted to stay in Oia but we are so glad we found Cavo Bianco and stayed in Kamari. It’s a great resort without the crowds and a good place to be based to explore the rest of the island. Thank you again, our stay was utterly delightful!! We will be back.The Routledges",0
It was incredible - top notch hotel with great breakfast in quiet part of island. Service and amenities are 5 stars. We got to the hotel and were welcomed with breakfast followed by planing of the 3 days in town - all by very knowledgeable team members. Room was very nice as well - true 5 stars boutique hotel,0
This hotel is amazing ! We stayed for 7 nights and couldn't have picked better hotel. The rooms and communal areas were all spotless and modern looking. The staff were extremely helpful and always ensured that we were happy. Location wise we found it to be perfect as It's very close to lots of restaurants and the beach but not so close that it's not peaceful. All in all if you're considering staying at Cavo Bianco..... Do it!,0
"My husband and I have just returned from staying at the Cavo Bianco hotel on the island of Santorini for two weeks - we've had the most amazing time with Effie and her wonderful staff who simply can't do enough for you - we initially booked a senior suite with a jacuzzi on the terrace - a mezzanine floor with staircase led up to a bedroom - the suite was ground floor but still had a great view of the mountain and was close to the tastefully decorated reception and restaurant - we then moved to a pool suite where we had exclusive use of a pool which was a decent size and had the sun from first thing in the morning until around 4pm which was cocktail time with our great waiter Gari so worked out perfectly for us (the pool room had the luxury of still being part of a hotel where we had breakfast and room service as we so desired but had absolute privacy too) for our final day and night we moved to the honeymoon suite (no pool or outdoor jacuzzi) but had a jacuzzi inside which was sunk into the floor with a window which could be opened to take in the mountain views while relaxing - all our rooms were spacious and very tastefully decorated with a white theme - the honeymoon suite also had the benefit of a four poster bed which was beautiful but all the beds are comfortable with lovely linen (changed daily if required), lovely plump pillows, soft towels and miniature toiletries if required. I took advantage of the spa and had a couple of treatments with Rachel a lovely English girl who was excellent at facial (around €45) and chocolate body works (around €130) both were well worth every penny in terms of the lovely calm, spacious beauty room and soft skin and feeling totally relaxed afterwards - defo recommend either (or both). We booked half board and I'm really glad we did - it meant that any time from around 1pm we could order off the menu and the food was freshly prepared to order - no specific recommendations as everything we tried was lovely but my favourite dessert was the fresh fruit salad with Cointreau! The location of the hotel was perfect for a five minute stroll to the beach and within a minute of bars and restaurants - Oia and Thira are lovely to see but we had experienced those on an earlier holiday and this for us was just about R&R which we certainly had. Santorini is not a 'cheap' place to visit although, no doubt we could have cut our costs but as this was a belated honeymoon we didn't but it's definitely not the best place to visit on a budget. In terms of returning to Cavo Bianco its a definite and I'm looking at next year already!",1
"Wonderfully stylish hotel, incredibly friendly staff, senior suite included a jecuzzi and mezzanine bed, two pools (one small), exceptional Greek-style breakfast, rooms silent at night despite outside music, beachside restaurants less than 5 minutes away, spa facilities great. My only complaint is nothing to do with the hotel- Santorini Airport was utter chaos to leave- 2 hours is an absolute minimum to get through disorganised chaos   Room Tip: The senior suite was excellent but the second king sized bed is a sofa bed See more room tips",1
We stayed in Cavo Bianco for 5 days. Hotel is modern and quiet. Breakfast are delicious. A great location. The Staff is wonderful smiling and helpful. They offered us a bottle of their own white Wine it was delicious. I recommend the Cavo Bianco they made our stay enjoyable definitely one of the best Kamari Hotel .,0
"This was the perfect base for our adventures in Santorini. It was a short walk from the beach and the restaurants of Kumari. It was no more than 30 minutes from any of the sites we visited while in Santorini. The rooms, common areas, and grounds were immaculate. The staff clearly takes great pride in their work and treat the hotel as if it were their own. Most importantly, the staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming. No matter the time, Irini and Effi were there to assist. Their recommendations were always spot on. They really seemed genuinely invested in making sure our experience in the hotel and Santorini as a whole was amazing. (It was and so was Cabo Blanco and the staff)",0
"We loved the whole feel of this hotel, very white modern and clinical, great ambience just puts you in a relaxed mind set as soon as you step in. Couple of minutes walk to Kamari beach (black beach) with plenty of restaurant choices. Staff were great, they were so helpful - you ask a question and they completely took over to make everything easy - they gave us late check out without fuss, the room was so clean and great design, balcony was huge, breakfast had everything you need. Pools and hallways were kept very clean and tidy. This hotel gives everything you need for a break to Santorini - and the bus stop to the capital is just outside, perfect! Special thanks to staff Vicky, Effy, Mihalis and Gerys. Would definately go back!",1
"We spend a week in Santorini. The Hotel was amazing, the people were really nice and everything in the hotel was perfect! The Hotel is close to the airport and everything you need is close too. Many restaurants, Beach, rentals for ATV etc. is nearby.",0
"Everything was nice, the weather, the people, the food and ...the ouzoCavoBianco is a very nice hotel and the staff is so kind. It is nice to have breakfast near the swimmingpool with lots of choice under birds' song. Thanks to everyone for these good moment",0
"we spent 7 days in Cavo bianco! we enjoyed every day we spent there.Best hotel,best staff, best service, best atmosphere. we already miss our lovely Effie, Gery, Michel. In this hotel there is everything to relax and to enjoy staying in Kamari. we are so thankful!   Room Tip: very comfortable rooms, bright, with good views and very quite room.s See more room tips",0
"Having heard amazing things about Santorini by friends and family, my wife (who is almost 6 months pregnant) and I decided to book a one week break and chose the Cavo Bianco from some of the reviews we had read on trip-advisor. All I can say is that this hotel and its staff are truly superb. From the moment we arrived, where we were greeted by the most friendly of staff, who welcomed us with cold drinks and answered many of the questions we had with regards to planning our trip around the island. Unfortunately we had to wait for our room to be prepared, so the courteous staff offered us an upgrade to a suite which is truly gorgeous and spans over two floors with the king size bed on the upper floor and a jacuzzi in the balcony. My wife is so thrilled, and this is making our stay in Santorini truly spectacular. The main pool areas are stunning too, with a choice of the traditional sun loungers or the even more luxurious four-pillared beds with drapes - there's nothing more you could ask for. We have only been here two days thus far and have enjoyed both the hotel and main strip of the town (with over a kilometre of restaurants and bars) and is less than several minutes walk away. We have hired a car and have already visited Oia, which is on the tip of the island, with the most spectacular views and opportunity to see an extraordinary sunset. We think this is a must if you visit the island and is a short 30mins drive from Cavo Bianco. I hope the rest of our holiday carries on like this and we will be sure to return to Santorini and Cavo Bianco in the future. Lastly, if you're thinking about booking this hotel, think no more. Book it, you will not be disappointed. I will be sure to provide an update toward the end our our stay here with more tips!",1
"We spent our honeymoon week in this fantastic hotel and from the first to the last minute we were like 'wooow'! We were met and greeted in a very warm manner.Receptionist Efi offered us a drink, showed us hotel, our room, explained everything and we got complimentary bottle of Santorini white wine with delicious fresh fruits. Staff is very helpful and they always seem very happy to see. Rooms are very stylish, beautiful, bright and extremely clean. Cleaning lady (ladies) done even more than they should have done. Hotel has 2 small pools. One is with sun lounges that you normally see only in pinterest. Breakfast was amazing. Also we tried mojito with fresh mint leaves from their garden and I strongly recommend it! We were very upset when we had to leave, but this only proves that our honeymoon was amazing with help by Cavo Bianco team. Thank you, guys, for everything!",1
"All the staff were really kind and helpful. The rooms are spotless with extra touch of white simplicity. Special thanks to the guy who helped us with our checkout and lugguage at 1am nonetheless!! Best wishes,Chin Family",3
"We loved our time at Santorini! It was a beautiful island! The hotel we stayed at was beautiful as well! The staff was phenomenal! So helpful and so kind to all of us! They should exactly what we would want to see, made reservations for us at great restaurants and were all round nice people. They really did seem just as excited to show us their island as we were to see it! The breakfasts were wonderful and the rooms were gorgeous! We would not hesitate to stay here again. Most definitely our favorite hotel through out our trip!",1
"Cavo Bianco is just lovely. The decor is very modern and calming-lots of white, clean lines, and interesting details. The flowered chairs in the dining area were a personal favorite. We had an early flight and arrived at about 9 am, expecting to drop our luggage and explore the area. We were greeted warmly, and offered coffee and a detailed description of the island and its main attractions. We were then informed that our room was ready and we could check in early, as well as enjoy the buffet breakfast. We were upgraded to a junior suite with a jacuzzi, which was a nice surprise. The room was great, the food was great, but the real winner here is the staff. Everyone at reception seemed genuinely enthusiastic to help us (down to helping me fasten my bracelet upon noticing me struggling) and answer questions. As we booked a cab to dinner on our last night, the two women at reception made a point to say goodbye and thank us because they would not be there in the morning when we checked out. Kamari is a great location-less congested than Fira or Oia, but with plenty of good restaurants and bars. It's very easy to get around, as there is a bus stop just steps down the road. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel, and would love to stay there again!",1
"The room was great, clean and large and the staff was always extremely friendly and helpful.On our last night they also upgraded us to the suite and let us keep the room until we had to leave for our flight even though it was 6 hours after the official checkout time.The breakfast was pretty good, the pool was great and the location is less than a minute walk from the beach (kamari is pretty small to begin with but never the less).In addition the bus stop is in front of the hotel so getting to anywhere on the island is very easy.",1
"My husband, my 14-year-old daughter, my 10-year-old son stayed there in a suite for two nights. It is only two minutes walk to the black sand beach, about 20 min drive to Fira and 40 min drive to Oia. Our room that was spotless had plenty of space and the decor was modern n simply chic. Service by the ladies at he front desk and the couple guys who helped w/ luggage and breakfast were just amazing. Upon arrival we were offered water while checking in in the lobby. Afterwards one of the ladies sat us down and went over all the scenic spots we could go on a map. On our first night the restaurant they helped make a reservation for us in Oia made a mistake w/ our time so we couldn't have a table to celebrate my husband's birthday. On the same night there was an issue w/ one of the lights so we could not turn it off before our bed time. The staff quickly fixed the problem n offered to switch our room to one w/ a private pool the next day. They also bought a cake to surprise my husband for his birthday. On our last day our flight departure time was 6:30 pm but the checkout time was 12pm. The staff allowed us to still hangout at the lobby, use the hotel's wifi and offered a shower and changing room to us if we decided to use the pool. We absolutely loved our experience there and would like to thank all the staff for their friendly, attentive and thoughtful service!!",0
"Cavo Bianco is a stunning boutique style hotel located less than 5 minutes from the beach. The rooms are wonderful, modern and kept to the highest standards. The staff were friendly and very attentive. The facilities include a main pool and a plunge/smaller pool that is located next to the an outside bar area.If you stay in Kamari, this is place to visit.",1
"Overall, the best hotel we have ever stayed in! The hotel itself and its facilities are fairly standard, the quality of the room and its amenities were top notch. The location of the hotel is about a 3 minute walk from the Black Beach, in my opinion perfectly situated as it is slightly away from the ""touristy"" area but still very accessible. What really stood out about this hotel is the extremely attentive and helpful staff. No request is too much trouble and they went above and beyond to help us at every stage; from day tours and planning to assisting when our AC remote stopped working. Fast and efficient even when that aspect went wrong.The room service meal we ordered was delivered swiftly in around 20-25 minutes and was absolutely delicious.Only two negative points about the room itself (Junior Suite in our case). Nowhere to hang towels conveniently when in the shower, and would have been nice to have sun loungers on the terrace next to the Jacuzzi.Our final two nights in Santorini were spent in a private villa (we had to extend last minute due to flight changes) which cost almost 5 times the price of Cavo Bianco, and I must say that the service and standard of room in Cavo Bianco was far superior.Keep up the good work! We will certainly be returning.   Room Tip: Junior suites have a good view of the ocean and are very quiet See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Cavo Bianco for the Santorini leg of our honeymoon and loved every moment. The staff provided exceptional service and truly helped us make the most of our stay. Perfect for couples as it is nice and quiet but only a short stroll from shops, restaurants and of course the beach. Can't wait to go back :)",0
"Luxury hotel, perfect for couples. Staff were incredibly helpful, went above and beyond to help us get the most out of our week in Santorini. We were upgraded to a superior double room on arrival and we were given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite with a hot tub, in the final days of our stay. Amazing hotel, amazing island.",0
"GREAT location! The pool with cabanas is perfect late afternoon if you want to relax in a quiet atmosphere. Perfect for young couples, or friends travelling together. Very modern, the service is outstanding, and its a short (2 min) walk to the beach and all of the shops. From the moment we stepped into this hotel, the service was on point. No complaints!",1
"We stayed at Cavo for a friends wedding and we were amazed!! The staff were consistently friendly and welcoming, especially Effie the Manager and Gary the Bar tender. The rooms were very clean and beautifully designed. We found that the hotel was extremely peaceful and you could barely hear the passing vehicles. The pools were clean, tranquil and to a very high spec. Sun loungers and beds were very comfortable. Gary our bar tender produced some fantastic cocktails which we consumed very happily at the pool side and before bed :DI would recommend this hotel to everyone!The staff really couldn't of done anymore to make our trip better. It was perfect in every way. I can't wait to visit Cavo again. This is by far a true gem in Kamari. Book it and have truely amazing experience!!   Room Tip: Junior Suites are amazing!! See more room tips",0
"Even though we arrived after 11pm. The staff welcomed us with open arms and a glass of delicious wine! The rooms are stunning . Cleanliness outstanding, delicious breakfast and the staff are especially helpful and friendly, which all added up to make the occasion of our daughter's wedding very special indeed. Beautiful stress free memories ! Thank you so much! The location was Awesome! Just below the road to ancient Thira and handy for the beautiful beach and lovely restaurants and bars! The 2 pool areas were relaxing and pristine! The things that you normally have to ask for were there and nothing was too much trouble! Definitely 5 star and above! Sue and Brian.   Room Tip: Ask for pool or garden view! See more room tips",0
"We travelled to Cavo Bianco with our 20month old for a week, visiting Santorini for our friends wedding. This hotel is not only beautiful, clean and stylish but the staff here will make you feel at home instantly. They were so kind and did their upmost to help whenever we needed something. Being more of a smaller boutique hotel, rather than a busy family hotel, but our son loved it, the staff loved him and looked after him! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are travelling to Kamari, Santorini. 5****** Thank you again to the whole team at Cavo Bianco for making our stay so comfortable and fantastic.",1
"We stayed here for a week, having come to Santorini for a friend's wedding. Our welcome could not have been more pleasing or warm. The hotel is beautiful, stylish and relaxing. We were greeted with delicious wine and offered tips about the island. When we assured them we weren't too tired for them to talk to us about their island they explained top places to go, things to do and offered any help we could possibly need. When we arrived in our beautiful room we found more delicious wine and a platter of fresh fruit, which was such a nice touch. The hotel facilities are excellent, it's a beautiful building with lovely pools with charming fairy lights at night, lots of comfy loungers and beds - we were never short no matter what time of day we headed to the pool - the room was spotless, very comfy and filled with nice toiletries. The breakfast has so many options, all absolutely delicious - especially the spanakopita - and on for such a long time which was much appreciated post wedding hangover. The staff, we cannot praise enough. So kind, friendly, helpful and totally unimposing. It is a small team so you get to know all faces and look forward to seeing them. We're sorry we can't recall their names but the Ukranian bellboy was absolutely charming and so helpful, and the lady with long light brown/blondish hair gave fantastic restaurant tips for around the island and was brilliant and very forthcoming for any advice. Our only possible criticism would be that the bar is very expensive so we didn't stay to enjoy too many drinks there, which we would have liked to do, and water in the mini bar is very expensive too. Otherwise a perfect place to stay and we will recommend it to all our friends and family.",1
What a beautiful hotel. Efi and the team made our 20th Anniversary so special. They even upgraded us to the honeymoon suite. All their recommendations were spot on. So close to the beach and lots of places to eat. We'll be back next year for sure!!!,1
"Staff was excellent and treated us like family. Accommodations were excellent! Grounds, room - extremely clean. Breakfast spread was the best we've ever seen and food was delicious. We waited many years to make the trip to Santorini. The airlines left our luggage in NYC. Ireni & Sia called relentlessly to help locate our bags (brought us robes and had our travel closed washed in an hour - our bags arrived the following day . . . service above & beyond). Everyone onsite made our trip memorable. Location was perfect for us - close to hiking restaurants, beach, shopping. We're looking forward to coming back next year!   Room Tip: Extremely clean, excellent staff, great breakfast, very relaxed atmosphere, great location See more room tips",0
"We had a great time at Cavo Bianco. The staff were really friendly and helpful, our room was beautiful and the location was great - a few minutes walk from the beach and much quieter than the hotels overlooking the sea. Breakfast was awesome and we had a lovely time.",0
"This is my first time ever writing a review, I never really bother but after visiting the amazing Cavo Bianco last week how could I not! Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 5 days during our visit to Santorini and could not fault this hotel one bit!Everything from the service to the atmosphere was exceptional, the hotel staff go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay- especially Irene, Ann-Marie and Gary! I usually like to venture out and about when I'm on holiday and hardly ever spend time at the hotel but we loved it so much at Cavo Bianco we spent most of our time here! I would definitely return to this hotel, next time for longer!",0
"A chic, boutique hotel that had a very relaxing atmosphere in a lovely part of the island. If you have not visited Santorini before we would highly recommend staying in Kamari, rather than the more popular Fira or Oia because it's less crowded with lovely beaches and excellent restaurants. The receptionist - Irini - was especially welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. she helped plan a very memorable holiday with great recommendations.The hotel itself had two outdoor pools, clean rooms with comfortable beds, and was located a few minutes away from the beach.We could not recommend this place enough!",0
"Great hotel..great breakfast..staff are amazing and work as a teamWe stayed at hotel wc 20th may and stayed for a week, which is just rightWe booked the honeymoon suite with jetted indoor jacuzzi which I would recommend rather than the outside Staff from the offset were a dream and accommodating as soon as we arrived offered a drink and we're given details of what we could do and sights thanks SiyaThe hotel staff were great ..happy and always greeted you when coming in and out of the hotelBreakfast. Plenty to choose from warm or cold cooked breakfast..and very tasty throughout our stay. Greek yoghurt and fruits yummy Cleaning staff keep the hotel spotless Irene another member of front desk was great too and recommended cantarmaran which we both throughly enjoyedLocation is good away from busy fira but only a bus stop away ...the bus stop is only outside the hotel and frequency is 30 minutes Kammari is middle ground ..plenty of restaurants and bars and shops to choose from Restaurants as many offer similar menu..I'd advise checking them for yourself rather than simply taking their word for it Kiwi ..Chinese -great food and reasonable pricedThira - try argo.. great food and a must We would recommend the hotel to anyone Let down wasElley from kamari travels is a sweet girl but a waste of time ... sorry but the travel company needs to employ someone who understands the business..passionate and can speak English and care about the holiday makers... not much knowledge",0
"I had already liked the look of the hotel when I had seen it on trip advisor. The hotel and staff lived up to my expectations. The hotel is very chic but so comfortable it started to feel like home in the short visit. We got upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi on the terrace a little cool to use in May as the temperature outside is in its 20s. The room itself was spacious and very nice, for a 7 year old hotel it is very well maintained. Breakfast was delicious and a good variety.The staff are incredible but one person in particular was Irene she gave good honest advice and in general was a lovely lady and very pleasant. She always made time fir you and her English was very good. She made our stay what it was. That was relaxed and making sure we used our time appropriately. Don't do the hotel transfer, normal cabs are 10 euros cheaper and the airport is only 7-10 minutes away! I would stay here again and recommend Cavo Bianco to all my friends and family!",2
"This is a small, stunningly beautiful family run hotel. It is on the edge of Kamari, which is at the bottom of Santorini, near the airport (but not noisy). The hotel is very white, deriving from the local Cycladic architecture, with fitments in local wood. It has 2 smal swimming pools, one with bar and a lovely bougainvillea covered terrace for breakfast, and the other with amazing four poster sun beds!. The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful; Anna Maria, the manager, is the daughter of the owner, and was constantly around, checking out that all was well. It is the only hotel I have ever seen with a ""pillow menu"" so you can choose the pillow that best suits you! Other than breakfast, we only ate there once; like all Santorini food it was fresh and well cooked. The hotel is well placed for the local beach and the big ancient Greek site, and has good public transport and organised trip links, though we hired a car. We booked this hotel through a deal, but I hope we can stay there again   Room Tip: All the rooms are lovely, and have private balconies. The location is very quiet See more room tips",0
"Hi,The Hotel is very nice and the staff is very friendly and experienced. they know what do you need even before you ask for it. we have book the standard room for two nights and the Senior Suite with Jetted Tub for One night, on the check in they upgrade our reservation to the Senior Suite with Jetted Tub without any additional cost and even without any request from our side.The Senior Suite was very very very clean and nice.. it makes you feel very comfortable and relaxed.the photos in the web site is reflecting the reality of the hotel and it worth every euro you bay.Its location is very close to Kamari beach 5 min walking.. any services like ATV rent, car rent, restaurants, coffee shops and any shopping you need are available around the hotel.Our flight was at 8:00 AM so needed to check-out early morning.. the hotel provided us an early check-out breakfast basket to take it with us to the airport... I was not expecting this level of caring from the hotel... I am really impressed.Thanks.",1
"We had a perfect stay, in the perfect location with perfect staff and hotel. We fell in love with the island and its people and it started as soon as we arrived at the hotel where the staff spent 30 mins with us explaining what to do during the week. Would recommend the island and hotel to anyone who wants a beautiful and relaxing holiday.",0
"We're half way through our stay here and so far so good the hotel is about 400 metres from beach and situated next to a track that leads you up to thira with lovely views about a 20 minute walk well worth the views. We opted for a junior sweet with hot tub the room it self is lovely, decerated nicely the rooms were always cleaned to high standard and the hot tub great although on here a few complaints about cold hottub the staff were more than happy to higher temperature up in them. The breakfasts were just right often a selection of meats, breads, cereal and fruit in the morning with tea coffee and juices whilst eating breakfast the staff were always happy and polite. Whilst here the head receptionist often came round everyone in morning to see if there was anything they needed and to make sure everyone was happy with there stay. We hired a buggy to go around island on through reception which made it a bit easier in terms of getting vehicle brought to us and easy to get it collected at hotel although cost about 10 euros more. The only real complaint would be pool a little too small but like this I'm a lot of hotels in santorini. The service here is great and staff always happy to help.",0
"What makes this hotel so special is the staff. They are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Upon arrival the lovely manager Anna-Maria was so informative about what we should do during our stay. She was genuinely interested in making our holiday in Santorini as fulfilling and memorable as possible. We weren't that lucky with the weather but Anna-Maria helped us make the most of our days and nights giving us fantastic restaurant recommendations and making reservations as needed. The hotel is beautiful, so clean, stylish and peaceful. We were chuffed to be upgraded but imagine that all the rooms are lovely as the cleanliness is second to none which for us is the number one requirement. The pools are small but perfectly adequate for cooling off when it's hot. Breakfast was varied and plentiful and the staff will do their best to accommodate your requirements as necessary. The beach is very near and very clean. Fantastic selection of restaurants, shops and a few bars. Lots of places were still closed but it wasn't a problem atall. We hired a car to visit Fira and Oia but agreed that Kamari is the best place to stay....for a start it's much cheaper and the bus stop is right outside the hotel so it's easy enough to visit other places. However we were pleased that we hired a car for a couple of days as it provided more flexibility. We will definitely return to Santorini and we will be staying at Cavo Bianco. See you soon guys! Thankyou xx",1
"We went to Santorini as a family of 3 and stayed in Cavo Bianco for two nights. The property itself is great with two common and pools and mini pools and jaccuzzis in the rooms. It was clean and well maintained.The service however was the highlight. I didnt have the time to plan my to do list in santorini beforehand, but the hotel staff ensured i didnt miss anything. They helped me plan my days and were really invested in me enjoying my stay.the location was great too as it was a short walk to the beach and close the food places and markets. The only thing is that their spa was shut and they didnt have 24x7 room service but if those things arent critical to you (as they werent to me), its more than worth the money.",0
"This holiday was such a great experience and mainly because the hotel was so efficient and friendly. The staff catered to your every need, lots of smiles and hellos. The front desk was helpful at all hours of the day. Anna Maria was especially helpful in setting up meetings for us with various vendors for venue searches who had also met us at the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good with a variety of food. We had received a free room upgrade when booking and got upgraded as soon as we reached the hotel. Good location- not too far from airport and a 2 minute walk to kamari beach. The poolside area is beautiful and clean! Pool bar was also good and made some good cocktails. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again upon a potential next visit. Thanks again to cavo bianco!",0
"And we mean it! We can't rate this boutique hotel and the team highly enough. They were attentive, friendly and wanted to ensure we got the best from our experience both at the hotel and in Santorini. They suggested things we might like to do and were always on hand to provide great restaurant recommendations (and book reservations for us).The hotel is of a high standard, all white and wood decor with plunge pools in some rooms. It was fully booked when we stayed, yet it felt serene. The only slight criticism I would have would be around breakfast service, the 'rush' could be anticipated so that the good selection of food is available throughout the window.We have stayed in hundreds of hotels, this rates as one of the best, we will definitely return.",4
"The staff were really friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was beautiful. We were also upgraded upon arrival which was a real bonus, however there was no indoor bar and the restaurant area seemed to be minimal.",1
"Great staff, close to many restaurants, close to bus stop and vehicle rentals. Breakfast has a ton of options and some of the best food we had on our trip. This hotel will not disappoint! Would stay here again. Beds are great and rooms are very modern and clean! Good wifi as well.",1
"Small but lovely hotel, staff are friendly and helpful. Gave us a free upgraded room on our second day. This hotel is in a good location away from the tourist part of the island but still convenient to get around. One minute walk to Kamari beach at the end of the street with nice restaurants.",1
The hotel was very nice and the staff helped us in any way the could. It is located a few blocks from the beach and the bus stop to visit other parts of the island is right across the street from the hotel. The breakfast was great.,0
This hotel is everything and more that I expected from santorini ! When you arrive it's like arriving into a beautiful blissful dream ! White white white ! All of the little details are amazing the finish and spec of the rooms was excellent ! The staff are fantastic everyone is just so helpful and happy it's really a treat to spend time here ! As a surprise they gave me an upgrade to the honeymoon suite for my birthday and brought wine and fruit to the room ! Wow Wow wow this is one not to miss !,2
"I have really enjoyed staying here. It's a lovely hotel not far from the beach, very stylish, quiet and offers delicious breakfast. All staff is super attentive and eager to help. Rooms are spacious and beautiful. No complaints whatsoever.",3
"It was a friends wedding and rather than fly in and out we thought we would stay for a week - a wise decision!!Due to the naff flight times we arrived at the hotel at 1:00 - there is always that slight worry that they may of shut up shop but thankfully the reception was still manned... we were given a room on the ground floor... the room was clean and smelled very fresh...As we hit the bed one of my bug bears cropped up - we booked a double room but the beds were two singles pushed together with one duvet covering them both...grrrrrrr... I refrained there and then (it was 2:00 by now) to complain and left it till the morning - in truth I complained first thing and by lunch time they had moved in a double bed!! Breakfast was buffet style and was fabulous lots of hot and cold offerings and on until 10:00 - you can also decide to eat inside or outside... There are two pools here and both are small but perfectly serviceable... the main one has 4 bed style sunbeds with covering - all very posh and there are several loungers... there was never a day went by that it was full... there is also a outside bar to help quench the thirst... I really liked the look and the ambience... I ventured downstairs to the gym and it was woeful - what was there was old and knackered and clearly just there to say ""we have a gym"" I didn't try the spa but from what I saw of it it looked great.... Location wise the hotel is in a fabulous position - far enough away from the maddening hoards and yet close enough to tap into when you fancy it... maybe a 5 minute walk to the beach... Overall Santorini exceeded expectations - the views are really impressive, quad bikes cheap to hire (even though you have to ask for a hat) and the food bills not too bad... I may even come back!!!",4
"It's quite simply an awesome hotel. Top heavy on 'honeymooners' obviously, but that's a small price to pay for such a stunning location.Admittedly it was a while since we stopped there but I need my hotel expert badge so what the hell!It is on a busy road quite a distance (though walkable ) from its 2 small neighbouring villages and probably one of the most unique rooms we have ever had. Cut out of the rock formation overlooking the bay - paradise is not the wrong work.Don't look at other hotels - just book this one.",0
"The view, service and rooms are amazing! Exclusive feel, highly accommodating. Grab a pool chair early, and enjoy every minute. I can't wait to go back and would recommend this hotel to anyone! It is a remote setting but easy to get where you want to go via bus, shuttle or taxi.",0
"This hotel suite was absolutely exquisite! It was everything you can imagine in a luxury property and and more. I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to be a guest at this beautiful property! The staff was amazing, had great knowledge of the Imeroviglia area, restaurants and activities to see in Oia, Imeraviglia and Fita! The sunset was even better! Mary at San Antonio Concierge, booked the Santorini Yachting Club for our sunset night and it was absolutely breathtaking! Angel (such a cutie) Anna, Dimetrios, Mary, Georgia and the entire staff at San Antonio were the epitome of hospitality management at its best. The management should be elated with the staff blithely have representing the San Antonio! I am looking forward to returning!",0
"It is so refreshing to receive such a personalized experience with staff that make you feel like nothing you ask for is too much. On top of that the resort is phenomenal, when I come back to santorini there is no where else I'd stay but here. These people have fine tuned absolutely everything. Thank you!",0
"We only stayed 4 nights and wished it was longer. The hotel is stunning - all the suites are set into the cliffs. The service was first class and the food in the restaurant was of a very high standard. Friendly, high quality staff. Would highly recommend for a romantic get-away.",0
"The view of the hotel is stunning and is far from the crowded places of Santorini. The breakfast is great. We stayed in the room with a bathtub outside and it is perfect, with great space. The staff is good and the concierges, Mary and Georgia, made our stay perfect!! I recommend and I want to come back!",0
"My husband and I booked this hotel after having seen it online and felt we needed a break away from it all. It is a lovely hotel and the staff were fantastic, they couldn't be more helpful and always smiling. The room we booked was a suite which overlooked the caldera, it had its own cool tub and two sun loungers, which was just as well as the pool loungers went very quickly, most people getting up at silly o'clock to reserve them. The food in the restaurant was superb and the restaurant staff were a delight, professional, friendly and knowledgeable. This wasn't a cheap holiday but if you want to go somewhere to totally chill, this is the place   Room Tip: Beds are a bit hard but they will provide a topper if you ask, not for beach overs as there isn'...

"We recently booked 5 days at San Antonio Suites--first of all, the property itself is INCREDIBLE. Nestled on/in the cliffs of Santorini, the poolside and restaurant view is spectacular. The rooms were spacious and immaculate, and the staff could not have been more gracious or accommodating----from the maintenance staff who wait until guests are out of their rooms before going into service the rooms, to the poolside staff bringing us chilled towels scented with Monoi oil--luxury! On to the restaurant--we loved that the food at breakfast and lunch were not overly stuffy or fancy/overpriced, while at the same time, the dinner is seriously high-level cuisine. Our first meal there rivaled a meal we had last year in Barcelona at a Michelin restaurant. The spa is amazing, and our concierge Mary was a dream come true. She was so helpful, accommodating, friendly--she made everything a breeze, and even took the time to walk around the property to say hello and see if we needed anything. We would not have any hesitation in booking this hotel again, and will be recommending it to friends far and wide!!!!!! Thank you to everyone at San Antonio who made this trip one to cherish and remember!   Room Tip: Some rooms open up on the pool deck, so if you want more privacy, request to be situated away from t... See more room tips",1
"Stunning view, great to relax. Very quiet and calm, friendly staff. Around 15min from the charming Oia town, worth going for dinner - great experience, nice food and super view!Make sure you take a room with private chair - not enough chairs in the pool area.",1
"We just came back from the most amazing 8 nights in San Antonio. The service was simply perfect, we can't fault in anything. Marry, Anna, Eleni, Dimitrius, Georgina and all the other staff made sure our stay was unforgettable. All the rooms have special, views. We stayed in room 19 and was fantastic. The food at the restaurant was also of very high standards. The hotel is just outside the busy towns, so you really feel relaxed but very easy to take a shuttle or taxi to both Oia and Imerovigli for dinner etc. We would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing time with perfect service and the most amazing views ever!",0
"This hotel has an amazing view of the Aegean. It is fancy, but to the point of being stodgy. There are lots of staff members, and the restaurant staff is great, but the front desk staff was not as much. There is no beach access. The hotel is isolated, so it's a cab ride to do anything other than sit in the pool or eat in the expensive restaurant. The hotel charges for coffee in the room. The bathroom is nice looking, but the shower is odd - there's no door and no curtain so the water goes everywhere. The pool closes early and the rules seem to be enforced.",0
"We stayed in San Antonio during our honeymoon to Greece. Santorini was our final destination so we wanted a place that we could enjoy the views and relax. Upon arrival we were greeted with drinks, they were also able to upgrade us for free to the honeymoon suite, which was very nice of them. The honeymoon suite has a Jacuzzi outside and a little private area where you can tan and enjoy privacy if you do not wish to sit by the pool. We tried going by the pool few times but if you do not go there early all chairs are usually taken before noon. You than have to wait for people to leave but sometimes people go and leave something behind so no one takes their spot. I find this a little rude as sometimes people did not come back for few hours. So having our private area with Jacuzzi really made the stay more pleasurable as we could soak and tan without having to leave the room really. The hotel itself is beautiful, the view is amazing and if you get on top of the hotel you can also see the sunrise on the other side. There is a bus stop right outside of the hotel, the bust stop is called San Antonio (when you take bus from Fira or Oia make sure to mention that bus stop to make sure the bus will stop there). Also right outside of the hotel there is an entrance to the trail that takes you to Imerovigli and all the way to Fira. We did that walk one day and it was amazing. The one thing we love about the hotel is that there is no crowds walking through the hotel like in Fira or Imerovigli and other places. When we walked from our hotel to Fira we walked through most of the hotels and you could see people tanning, swimming, a lot of the times you walked by peoples rooms and we did not like that. I would hate to be relaxing while hundreds of people walk right by my room. San Antonio is more private and its a big plus. The food was good. We did the breakfast every morning and there was a lot of different variety that will satisfy anyone. We had our favorites everyday and always tried something new in addition to that. We ordered room service once and ate breakfast at in our room also. The staff is super friendly and will do everything to accommodate you. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a little more privacy. The only negative thing that I experienced was the bad. I did not find if very comfortable and the sheets were not very soft. I usually love sleeping in hotels as the beds are comfortable and I love the pillows and sheets but not at this hotel. Everything was perfect except that for us at least. I am not sure if it was just us being tired from two weeks on the road, or our bodies were so beat up from the sun and exploring that the bed felt like that, I have no idea. But I was able to nap in the Jacuzzi so its all good :)",0
San Antonio Suites is excellent! The rooms are good size with a private outdoor area. The air conditioning works perfect. The view outside the room is spectacular! The staff is so friendly and so accommodating. They offered us drinks when we arrived and sent us a gift basket since it was our wedding (it was at another venue). The room service was great and the food quite tasty! Highly recommended.,0
"Stunning location and the hotel is equally stunning. The staff are wonderful, Mary and Aphrodite (wonderful name) and all of the front desk staff were the most helpful and welcoming staff we have ever experienced at a hotel. The restaurant staff and room service, maintenance guys and spa therapists, everyone we came in to contact with made us feel like the only guests there. We hope to return one day. Thank you all. One of the questions this Trip Advisor review asks is if there is a swim-up bar - even better, your drinks are delivered by the beautiful or handsome attendants.   Room Tip: All the rooms are gorgeous! See more room tips",0
"Amazing hotel! We will definitely be back. Room 12 is so beautiful, great views and right by the pool. Breakfast buffet is perfect, very elegant and tasty. The staff at San Antonio are very helpful and friendly and go out of their way to help you. We can't wait to go back!",0
"Transfer from AirPort to hotel was smooth Upgraded to the Honeymoon suite as soon as we arrived, and the place was stunning. Clean, beautiful surroundings, elegant design and the view is breath taking. Staff is exceptionally kind, and will help you with everything you ask. I'm coming back!",0
"This hotel has the most amazing view! The staff is welcoming and helpful. The girls at the concierge desk will help you arrange anything you need outside of the hotel. Welcome drink and then bottle of wine upon arrival are a perfect touch. The rooms are clean and spacious with large bathrooms including shower and tub. The breakfast buffet leaves nothing for want and is delicious! The location is quite, but perfectly located in between the cities of Oia and Fira. We loved our stay!   Room Tip: I don't believe you can go wrong with any of the rooms at this luxury boutique. See more room tips",1
"We moved into this hotel after spending some time in Oia-this one is something different. Away from the hustle and bustle, but as chic as can be. Roos are great, way bigger than any hotel in Oia can afford, bathrooms are crazy gorgeous. But hte terraces are the miracles! The best part was watching the clouds literally slide down the mountain and right by your terrace at night. Open breakfast terrace offers incredible view",0
"Where to start......that view (again), the staff, the food?!? All are exceptional. This is our third visit to San Antonio, it is no surprise that this hotel is in the small luxury hotels of the world category, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated to and exceptional level of service. We never tire of that special moment you walk through the beautiful reception, through the door to that stunning view of the Caldera, WOW!On arrival the reception staff are so attentive, Vania (Operations Manager) and her team (Fani, Mary, Alexandra, Georgia) welcome you with open arms, looking after your every need. As repeat guests we were upgraded to the Master Suite (Rm No 27) which we will forever be in gratitude for, the balcony is very large with a stunning view looking towards Oia. The room itself is beautifully decorated.The pool view again is something you can never tire of, that infinity pool overlooking the Caldera.....heavenly! The restaurant food, I don't think there are many, if any, that serve to a higher standard on the island. The team obviously take immense pride on the standard of food they serve and we were never disappointed. Even the pool snacks are awesome!!I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Anna and Dimitri and all the pool staff for the exceptional level of service we received, we were made to feel like royalty!! 5 star without over doing it. They instinctively know when you need something and when to leave you to your peace and quiet. San Antonio is THEE play to come for that perfect relaxing retreat, away from the busier towns of Fira and Oia (only 10 mins drive) and for us that is what makes this hotel the best on the island, seclusion is what San Antonio specialise in. Peace perfect peace.......!In summary you could not be disappointed by anything here. The service, the food, the rooms.....but above all else that view!! In Santorini with most hotels being built on the cliff face they share the same view but San Antonio has that wow factor of being set in it's own bay with your own private view of the Caldera!!Again, a huge thank you to Vania and her team for making our holiday so special!! Hopefully see you again soon with baby C!!! :-)Lots of love, Garry & Lynsey xx",0
"My wife and I decided to book a luxury boutique hotel to make the most of the beauty of Santorini and San Antonio does not disappoint.From the moment we arrived, the staff were helpful, attentive but not over-bearing. We were taken to our room which was better than we had booked, on the balcony next to the pool. The hotel is far enough from the main town of Fira to avoid the noisy clubs that blast music until 2am.Breakfast was amazing, with too many options to choose from. Complimentary 30min spa visit is a nice touch, but make sure you book in advance as it fills up.Other features: - 24hr concierge - twice daily room servicing - Incredible caldera views - complimentary bottle of local wine on arrival",0
"We stayed in Santorini for 5 nights- 2 at the San Antonio and 3 at the Chromata- because we wanted to stay in two different locations on the caldera. We wish we had just stayed at the San Antonio the entire time! The photos do not do the property justice and we were overwhelmed by the view when we arrived! The level of service was incredible- everyone we interacted with was kind, attentive and generous with their time and knowledge. The rooms are spacious, clean and much more private than anything else we saw on the caldera; the pool is also one of the largest on Santorini. The included breakfast was great- lots of options- and dinner was fantastic! The hotel is a bit secluded- between Oia and Firostefani- but we felt that was a plus- it was quiet and relaxing at night but close enough to go to ""town"" for dinner or an adventure. If we come back to Santorini- we will only stay at the San Antonio!",0
"Myself and boyfriend stayed the end of September 2015. We arrived late evening and were picked up from the airport by the hotels private car, to be then greeted in reception and given a low down of the hotel and surrounding areas, before being taken to our (upgraded) room. As we were taken down the stairs we were presented with our super private room with an outdoor hot tub. They had left wine and fruit in the room too! The view at breakfast looks onto the caldera and were literally some of the best I have ever seen. The breakfast itself was delightful, it included free pouring sparkling wine, eggs made to order and lots of fresh bread, pastries, fruit, yoghurt etc etc. we also had lunch a few times which were also a high level of quality.Halfway through the holiday my partner proposed on a private boat at sunset (!!!!) My sister in law had phoned and ordered a suprise bottle of champagne for us and the staff went that extra mile and decorated our room with rose petals, candles and fruit. What a lovely touch! We also received a free dessert at lunch.It didn't affect us as we were there to enjoy the serenity of the resort, but be aware there is no bar on the grounds of the hotel. You can of course order drinks to your room, at the restaurant etc but no physical bar to sit at, we quite enjoyed this. The hotel is a little remote but you can jump on a bus right outside the hotel and head in 15 minutes in either direction to Oia or Thira for only a few euros. We will return at some point in the future, mainly to enjoy the views at breakfast and watch the sun set into the sea. Magnificent.   Room Tip: Room with outdoor hot tub is fab, with amazing views. See more room tips",0
"We went there for my boyfriend birthday and it was more fabulous than i could have imagine. Absolutely a place to come back. The service was super very warm welcome we had. The rooms were clean. Was really great! We truly enjoy our stay. the food was really good we eat everyday in the hotel (just saying) really good! A place to recommend for sure. The view where amazing no picture no texte could describe what you see feel when you are there. Thanks for everything.Best hotel i have stayed so far.   Room Tip: best views,good service,clean,warm welcom, See more room tips",0
"We had an amazing stay at San Antonio Suites. Everything was perfect, the staff were amazing and the photos just don't do it justice. If you are thinking about going to Santorini stay here! You will not regret it! Incredible!! Thank you! Especially to Maria on the front desk she was just the nicest and helpful person!",0
"This was truly one of the most beautiful places in the world. The hotel staff was amazing. They couldn't do enough, from moving chairs at the pool, serving drinks to recommending the best restaurants to visit.The suites were spacious. The outdoor area was our own little paradise with a private garden, jacuzzi, lounge chairs and the most breathtaking view of the caldera.I would recommend this hotel to anyone use to staying at 5 star resorts.",0
"My boyfriend and myself visited San Antonio suites at the end June for a weeks stay. We were very excited to arrive as the photos and reviews had all been very good, and to our delight it was everything we expected and a lot more. Walking through reception to see the amazing views, no picture could show its true beauty! We were amazed to be told we had been upgraded for 2 nights in a superior suite which had its own hot tub! The room and bathroom was absolutely perfect, crisp white sheets , King size bed and a lovely big jacuzzi bath! After the two nights we moved to another amazing room ( all rooms are sea view) the decor through out is stunning shabby chic style. I can't praise this hotel enough. The breakfast was lovely , the lunch at the pool was incredible ! The best burger we've ever had;) the dinner was very high standard smaller portions but full of flavour. The staff are a absolute credit to this hotel, they all made our stay so enjoyable. We will be telling everyone to come here and see it for themselves. I really challenge any one to find a better hotel! The only down side is to get to oia or Fira (the main tourist towns) you have to get a bus or taxi because it's a good couple of miles. We weren't expecting it to be expensive but the taxis are actually more than the uk! In a way it's quite nice to be tucked out the way and pop into the towns for the odd evening meal. They are well worth a visit as they have the classic santorini buildings with stunning views. Over all this is an incredible holiday and I would urge anyone to give it a go you will not be disappointed :)",1
"We stayed for a week in June and I would echo all the great comments from other reviewers, this hotel is absolutely fantastic. All the staff are amazing, if you want any help or advice about anything just ask. They are very knowledgeable about the Island and arranged car hire, restaurant bookings and taxi's.The hotel is situated between Oia and Imerovigli and this provides for peace and quiet and total relaxation. If you want to explore further there are a number of options:Bus - stops outside the hotel and runs approximately every 20 minutes in both directions between Oia and Fira. The hotel will provide you with a timetable.Taxi - the hotel has two mini buses that will transport you for the same price as a taxi. If they aren't available the hotel will book you a local taxi.Walk - You can walk to Oia and Imerovigli in about 90 mins. Its a bit up and down and you will need some decent footwear (and water). The walk is along the rim of the Caldera so the views are stunning, well worth the effort but start early in high summer.Donkey - these are available on the path between the hotel and Oia to take you up the hill.Car Hire - Just ask the hotel and they will arrange for a car to be dropped off and picked up at the hotel car park. All very easy. Enjoy the seclusion that the San Antonio offers, but getting around the Island is pretty straightforward.   Room Tip: All rooms have excellent views, the more expensive rooms are more secluded and have outdoor Jacuzzi... See more room tips",4
"My husband and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary in Santorini and we chose the San Antonio Hotel. How utterly delighted we were that we chose it. From the moment we arrived at this beautiful and stunning hotel we were blown away. From the welcome from the most gracious, kind and very hard working reception staff, for the greatest surprise to being upgraded to the most amazing Master Suite with an outdoor Jacuzzi, with the most stunning views across the caldera. Within half an hour of arriving, we were greeted also with a welcome bottle of wine and fresh fruit, which was extremely gratefully received. We stayed for 8 nights, and we cannot praise the team at the San Antonio hotel highly enough. The room service meals were beyond expectations, as well as the pool service, from the food to the fantastic frozen Daiquiris!! Breakfast was great, any combination of coffees and eggs any way you wanted, and the guys on duty on breakfast were so helpful and kind and most important of all, happy. There was nothing that the team could not do for you. The icing on the cake for us was, on the evening of our Anniversary we arrived back at our room to find that the staff had laid out on the floor and table, two big hearts made out of lit tea lights and a delicious Anniversary cake with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary card from the team at San Antonio. Soooo very kind and special, and very unexpected. We cannot praise this hotel highly enough from the hotel itself and the wonderful team that run it, from the Reception Team, the gorgeous Vania, the pool staff, the restaurant team, the boys that help with cases etc, the cleaners etc etc. Greek hospitality at its finest. We cannot wait to return. Thank you so very much.",1
From when you walk into the hotel you feel that you are in another world. It has very few rooms and therefore it feels very quiet and relaxing. The staff were all wonderful and the the level of service they gave was outstanding. The attention to detail is second to none and the rooms are beautifully appointed and the food is excellent.This is the second visit for my wife and I and on both occasions we have stayed for three nights and we have thoroughly enjoyed our breaks and hope to go back again.   Room Tip: All rooms are great and have outstanding views. See more room tips,0
Although the staff were polite and helpful the manager Ms Vania was dreadful!! She screamed at us when we asked if we could check out earlier than our booked three nights. We were willing to pay for the first night. We could not believe that someone from the hospitality industry could talk to to a customer like that. When we told her that we are going to put her behaviour on trip advisor she was like do whatever you want. Because of her we will never go back to that hotel again! Another thing. They charge you three euros for coffee you make in your room in the coffee machine provided. Never heard of that before either!!,6
"Overall, my wife and I were very pleased with our stay. We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary, and the hotel provided the ideal backdrop. Staff very friendly and competent.2 areas they could improve upon are wifi strength and air conditioning power. Oh, and watch out that there is very little privacy in some of the rooms between the room and the bathroom.",0
"The hotel is wonderful,nothing like previous hotels in Greece.We got upgraded twice,both rooms were wonderful with amazing views. The staff were brilliant,especial thanks to all at the restaurant,Elena and Anna in particular,your service and the food were great.The rooms were so clean and beautiful,didn't like the rather open plan bathroom in the first but recognise that this is the fashion.Yes the hotel is rather in the middle of nowhere but the local buses stop just outside and are great fun and very cheap.This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed atThank you all so much",0
"Me and my husband have visited this wonderful hotel twice now, two years running. As frequent travellers, we have never felt so relaxed and so spoilt as we are at San Antonio suites. The staff, the rooms, the views, the food and the delicious drinks and cocktails just blow us Away.Our beautiful room (number 19) comes with its own balcony with loungers and jacuzzi, and we didn't stop staring at the view for more than five minutes. Tucked away in a private spot just off a main road between some of the busier villages (which were lovely to visit but too busy for us to stay too long in) the hotel is in the perfect location for couples and people just wanting to completely switch off. I honestly couldn't recommend it highly enough. One small issue is that if you want to relax by the pool, you might not gets beds unless you are very early birds! I think that for some of the rooms without loungers, a spot with some extra loungers for when the pool is busy would be great!Also, the tasting menu at the cliff side restaurant is to die for (book a table looking out at the incredible view) Thankyou so much to all the wonderful staff for making our stay so special.",1
"This is a great choice for a honeymoon hotel in Santorini. It's a boutique hotel of the very best standard - great service, well-designed rooms, a killer view, and an atmosphere that embodies small luxury.We were there for 5 nights, and from the 2nd night onwards we got upgraded to a suite. I loved the look they were going for, and it's done so well that you feel like you're at a good friend's chic home. Both rooms were beautiful in their own right, with lots of white and a pop of color and stone. Each had an outstanding view of the caldera, and the suite was particularly bright and airy, with an outdoor jacuzzi to soak in too.On the first night of our stay, there was a noisy wedding in the hotel next to San Antonio. I understand how they'd be limited in preventing that. The music died down past midnight. Even then, it wasn't enough to ruin a good night's sleep and the days following.All areas of the hotel are well-maintained, and everyone here is warm and friendly. The breakfast buffet was small but of good quality, and I loved having their greek yogurt every morning. The restaurant is very good as well - try the lamb, which I had several times. The spa may not have been as outstanding as other ones I've been to, but it was still a relaxing time for us. Romantic, intimate, and of a very high standard throughout, I highly recommend a stay at San Antonio.",0
"I strongly recommend this hotel for any couple seeking for a romantic getaway. The stunning view from the caldera is just a small part of the experience we had at San Antonio hotel. The staff were always very helpful and nice, always asking if you need anything with a large smile on their faces. A fruit basket with a delicious local white wine was offered us as a welcome gift as soon as we got to the bedroom. The swimming pool by itself is enough reason to stay there, but the bedroom is also an invitation. Carefully decorated with a mediterranean theme, very clean and with room service twice a day. Even in a paradise as Santorini, it was hard to find a reason to leave the hotel and explore the island. If you are willing to have a great fancy dinner, don't think twice about trying the hotel restaurant. A little bit overpriced, but the food worthed every penny. In summary: an experience of a lifetime.   Room Tip: Every room has views to the caldera See more room tips",0
"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. We arrived at San Antonio after a wedding in Athens and it was exactly what we needed. We stayed for 3 nights and I wish we could have stayed longer. The view from San Antonio is indescribable. We were in awe from the moment we arrived, to the moment we left. Our room was very kindly upgraded to an amazing master suite with an incredible view, outdoor and indoor jacuzzi and the room was beautifully decorated in neutral tones.The staff of the hotel cannot do enough to help you, they are always on hand and are so friendly.We ate in the hotel once for dinner and twice for lunch as well as every day for breakfast. The breakfast was fantastic with a gorgeous view each morning, the lunch was excellent and dinner superb.I was a little hesitant about the location of this hotel as I usually like to stay in the centre of a town but it was perfect. We walked 1 day to Oia and the next to Fira which was great. We really enjoyed being close to towns but still able to enjoy the calm peace and quiet. I haven't stopped going on about San Antonio and Santorini since we got back. It was the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we cannot wait to go again.",0
Great place to spend a relaxing vacay; awesome service; beautiful scenery. We went at the very start of tourist season when the hotel just opened so it was exceptionally quiet and amazing. Can easily access more touristy spots. Highly recommend!,0
"We stayed for a week at the end of May and had the most relaxing holiday ever. San Antonio suites is the best place we have ever stayed. Often when you have a lovely holiday, there are one or two things which could be improved on, but not here. This genuinely is the most amazing place to stay if you want to totally relax and take time out.The whole place is immaculate, the entrance has a total wow factor, with a stunning view of the sea. We had a beautiful master suite with our own outside Jacuzzi, sunloungers and sofa. Towels are changed twice daily.The staff here are wonderful, they are so professional, friendly and genuinely want to look after guests, they remember every little bit of information and offer such a personal service, I can honestly say I have never stayed anywhere with staff so lovely. Each and everyone of them, receptionists, breakfast and dinner waiters, cleaning and maintenance staff, spa staff, all appear to be so happy in their work. We felt thoroughly pampered. Breakfast offers something for everyone, with a vast selection of fruit, muesli, yoghurts, bread, pastries, meats, cheeses, hot options and eggs to order. Not to mention fresh juices, prosecco, teas and any type of coffee you choose. Nothing is rushed and the food is regularly replenished so late arrivals have the same choice,As for the restaurant, this is fine dining at its best. We ate in the restaurant five times during our stay it was so good, the chef here is so talented and cooks with passion. The food is certainly not overpriced, there is a great wine selection, particularly the local wine. Every meal was beautifully presented, and tasted amazing. A special thank you to the two wonderful waitresses in the restaurant Eleni and Anna, service with a smile every time and to Dimitri, Aggelos and Anna the breakfast staff all so helpful and friendly.If you are considering booking a holiday in Santorini and are toying with options of where to stay I would definitely recommend San Antonio we would love to return - we didn't want to leave it was superb.   Room Tip: I imagine all the rooms are gorgeous here See more room tips",4
"Wow. This hotel is really something special and the perfect place to honeymoon on Santorini. The views are simply stunning and it is difficult to describe adequately how relaxing this place is, exactly what we needed.From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing, they are so polite and do everything to a really high standard. Our room was immaculately clean with an incredible view of the Caldera, our own jacuzzi and a large terrace.The restaurant has fine dining in the evening, the food is both well presented, a good size and delicious, a big thank you to Eleni and Anna who were so friendly and helpful. There are more casual options during the day and we made use of the room service available to fully enjoy our terrace; this always arrived promptly with a smile.Having visited the other towns on the island the hotel is outstanding in its privacy and size, we were so glad we made the decision to stay here, especially with its romantic couples spa treatments.Mary was fabulous in recommending the best trips on the island, the sunset boat trip was amazing and the best way to see the sunset from Oia. She also recommended some good local places to eat and made our reservations to ensure we had the best table available.Thank you to all who works there, we really had the best time and it will certainly be a special honeymoon to remember.",1
"We stayed for two nights in a poolside room. The views are breathtaking and the customer service exceptional. The staff knew what we needed before we could even think about it. The hotel lobby is a tunnel through the mountain, that was my main selling point. The tunnel did smell of cigarette smoke, but my friend didn't even notice cause the view. Also, the bathroom is connected to the room by clear, uncovered windows and glass door, but I just covered them up with the towels and bathrobes provided, so it wasn't an issue. Breakfast was served by the pool every morning with a view of the entire caldera from up above. It would be nice if you have a car or are an avid hiker (1.5 hrs to the nearest town) because taxi or car service is €15 one way and the bus might not stop for you. The hotel and the staff were really impressive, making this an outstanding retreat.",0
"After travelling a month through Europe, San Antonio Suites was by far the most outstanding accommodation we stayed at. In fact, I would have to say out of anywhere I have stayed in the world, San Antonio Suites out rates the lot! From the moment we arrived we were treated so beautifully by all staff. They were all so warm and pleasant. Would definitely return in the future!",0
"I treated my husband to a five-day stay at this hotel in mid-April. Everything about the place was truly amazing. Santorini is, of course, exceptionally beautiful and the hotel was perfectly situated to take advantage of the glorious views. All the staff were lovely, extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Our room, or suite, was one of the best I,ve ever stayed in, with a big, comfortable double bed and spacious lounge area. It opened out to a huge trrace overlooking the sea, fully equipped with sun loungers and even a large hot tub -perfect for enjoying a glass of wine once the sun had gone down.The cleaners were as quietly efficient and pleasant as the rest of the staff and made sure everything was always immaculate. Breakfasts in the terraced restaurant were generous and varied. We had dinner there on three of the five nights and, again, the food was delicious and the staff charming. They even provided a cake for my husband's birthday.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone seeking complete luxury at a reasonable price. We came away feeling totally relaxed and completely pampered. Even the weather was exceptionally good to us.   Room Tip: We were in a 'junior suite' but, in fact, there was nothing junior about it. See more room tips",0
"The pictures on the website do not do this hotel justice. It is honestly the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in. The views are incredible, the hotel is impeccably clean and the food at their restaurant is amazing. And most importantly, the staff are absolutely brilliant, warm and friendly. Reception staff are always on hand to offer assistance, travel arrangements and excursions. We could not have asked for a better holiday!",3
"I'm so glad we stayed at this hotel il instead of a hotel in Oia. It's so private and secluded,perfect for a relaxing honeymoon. The Oia hotels have smaller pools and balconies that are open to the hundreds of tourists that pass by everyday . San Antonio Suites is the most beautiful hotel we've ever been in. The views are breathtaking, the food is Michelin star quality and the staff are the nicest people you'll meet. Elena, Anna, Afroditi and Mary, you made our stay such a pleasant one! Thank you very much for accommodating our every need. They helped us booked an atv for the day and made sure we found our luggage! They took care of communicating with the airport and the luggage showed up in our room the following day which is such a relief! PROS-private-the view of the caldera. The hotel is nestled in the mountain. -the pool, it's huge! (Compared to the ones in Oia hotels)- staff- suites- spacious. We had the suite with a hot tub overlooking the caldera! It was pretty amazing waking up to that view every morning. -food- everything was delicious and fresh! Breakfast is included with sparkling wine. We had dinner at the restaurant in the balcony and it was unforgettable. -chapel on site CONS-no gym. After such yummy food and lounging all day I really needed a run. There's no gym so we hiked instead -no free shuttle service to and from airport. Set this up earlier to avoid the hassle of waiting for taxis at the airport. -price- since no other restaurants or shops are nearby we ate at the hotel most of the time which can get pricey, but worth every penny. -no direct view of the sunset- go to Oia for that. We hope to be back again!",0
"I can't praise this hotel enough. The suites are beautiful (we swapped rooms to have a private hot tub so stayed in two different rooms) and all 29 have wonderful views of the Caldera. They are immaculately clean, well appointed and spacious. The restaurant is intimate with inside or outside eating, the food amazing and the staff make the whole experience an absolute pleasure. If you're looking for the perfect place for peace, relaxation, superb food and wine, glorious views , space, gleamingly clean rooms and the loveliest team of helpful smiley beautiful people to look after you then look no further. You won't be disappointed.",1
"We knew from the moment that the reception staff first greeted us that the San Antonio Suites were a special place. Moments later, when we walked through the double doors and caught our first view of the caldera we knew that it would be a spectacular place. Later that evening, whilst we were eating our first meal at the restaurant we realised that it was a truly amazing place.We enjoyed some excellent meals during our stay in Santorini, and the best for both food quality and service was the restaurant at the San Antonio.The rooms and shared facilities at the hotel are excellent, and the staff are, without exception, wonderful. They all seem to be focussed on doing whatever they can to ensure that you have the best possible holiday experience. So attentive, so friendly, and everything done with a smile. They are the hotel's greatest asset.The only potential issue is that some people might find the location a little too isolated. Of course, being isolated can also be a benefit. Actually, we found that it wasn't an issue because there is a local bus stop on the road immediately outside, rental cars (or quad bikes) can easily be arranged, or, like us, guests can make use of the friendly, courteous and efficient hotel drivers with their modern, comfortable 8-seater Mercedes vehicles. Also, the coastal path is adjacent to the hotel and the centre of Imerovigli can be reached in about 45 minutes at a steady walking pace. It takes a little bit longer to reach Oia, and some sections of the route are along a busy road, so we did not attempt that walk.We really enjoyed our week-long stay at the San Antonio suites. It is a wonderful place with exceptional staff.",2
"Have just stayed 3 nights at the hotel. The welcome was very warm but unfortunately the foyer smelt of smoke and I noticed a lady working in her office smoking throughout the day. Not professional when we are paying over $800 per night. The rooms were great and we were upgraded. Thank you. However there is not a lot of privacy from the bathroom. Glass windows from the bedroom to the bathroom. I didn't mind the privacy factor that much it was more that when someone had to get up in the night and put on the light in the bathroom, it woke the other person up in the bedroom because there is no way of stopping the light coming through. The staff in the dining room were particularly good, professional and friendly. Thanks. A van took us back to the port for our transfer and it was 15 euro for each person. Just letting you know that it costs exactly the same if you get a taxi, so it's a good service the hotel offer.   Room Tip: A room away from the pool area. See more room tips",1
"From the moment you walk into the hotel you are completely in awe of the views. Just stunning!! The staff was so nice and very accommodating. The views, are spectacular of the caldera (fortunately from our room we got a glimpse of the sunset but not a direct view secondary to location of the hotel). We ended up getting a massage which was also very wonderful (I had a prenatal massage as I am 5.5 months pregnant and the staff was very accommodating to me). As this hotel is in the middle of Oia and imerovigili we ended up eating at the hotel for most meals bc the quality of food choices (ESP since I'm vegetarian and they had an entire veggie menu! ) was so much better at the hotel than any of the other restaurants. There are many hotels to choose from in santorini, but, my husband and I were VERY pleased with every aspect of our stay at San Antonio suites. We hope to come back there soon!",1
"This is the first time I have written a review whilst still there. This hotel is just fantastic but the staff make it, they really do look after you and appear to enjoy doing it. The views are great, the pool is lovely, the rooms are clean and relaxing. I could go on but I cannot fault this place. The Restuarant food is a delight in every way.If you want to be treated to a brilliant hotel stay this is definitely the place to go.   Room Tip: We stayed in room 20 which was lovely and quite with superb patio. See more room tips",1
"As a family, we have just returned from spending a week at the hotel. Overall we had a very good time. It has dramatic views over the caldera. We had a master suite which was well appointed with an outdoor jacuzzi and large balcony. The entire complex is exceptionally clean.The food was of high quality. Breakfast is served either inside or outside the restaurant. We had dinner one evening and the Lamb Confit dish was of Michelin star standard.We have two slight issues. Firstly the hotel is described as being located ""Imerovigli -Oia Outskirts"". In reality it lies equidistant on a main road linking the two villages neither of which are within easy walking distance (approx. 10 minutes by bus in each direction). Secondly, as no shops are located close by, we had to rely on water being provided by the hotel. We each received one small bottle of complimentary water every evening. Otherwise we had to use the expensive minibar water. On checking out it was only then that we were informed that you can actually purchase small bottles of water from reception. Hope this tip helps!Finally, it is very isolated for a small island but if you require a quiet, dramatic and quality holiday then it's a very good choice",2
"We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon in June 2015 and we absolutely loved it! It was the perfect choice for real relaxation after a hectic wedding planning and executing period!We had a wonderful experience on our 1st day at the spa. And then we took a long hike towards Fira during sunset. The views along the road are amazing and it's a perfect walk! We had a beautiful spacious suite with a jacuzzi on our private terrace. We had breakfast delivered to our terrace and everything was awesome. The staff at front office were also really helpful and friendly. They helped us arrange a semi-private catamaran trip which was also great. In short, I would definitely recommend this hotel for all people who are looking for peace and relaxation in their vacation.",0
"Not sure why this isn't number one in the town, it's miles better than everything located in the middle of the town. All the places in the centre of the town and in oia are built on top of each other with tiny pools, all overlooked by each other and the cruise tourists walking right past your sun bed, you don't realise this on the resort pictures...Here you have luxurious larger rooms with a much bigger pool and much more privacy. Food and staff are excellent, we even got a room upgrade with a private hot tub!! Only tip I would say is you need a hire car/taxis, it's a bit too far from town to walk.",1
Fabulous hotel & service. The staff really were lovely. Nothing was too much. Now one of our most favourite hotels and we travel a lot all over the world. Certainly going again. Restaurant was first class. Not far from Oia or Fira. Hired an ATV and that was really fun and an excellent way to explore the island.,0
"Location:Located between Imorivigli and Oia, this hotel is very quiet and peaceful. The best place to relax in Santorini. The views are absolutely stunning and I believe San antonio is the hotel with the biggest pool.You can walk from the hotel to either Oia or Imorivigli, amazing walk and beautiful views (but bring your walking shoes with you as you have to go through the mountains)!Service:All the staff is perfect. The service is fantastic, they are very friendly and always here to help you. If you need a taxi they arrange it for you, you can either use their driver if available or they call a normal taxi. They don't charge extra for the driver but normal taxi prices which I appreciated.Restaurant:The breakfast is a buffet but the food is very nice, good quality, lots of options and again great staff!The only negative point about the restaurant is dinner. It is a bit overpriced compare to other amazing restaurants in the Island. So I would recommend going out for dinner.Rooms:We stayed in a Junior suites, the room was spacious, clean and the wifi was working perfectly. They also have a cleaning service twice a day which is nice.BUT one thing that they really really need to change is the bed. The mattress is very very firm so after a week you start getting neck and back pains...A medium mattress would change the hotel to absolute perfection!",0
"From the moment u enter the hotel to the moment u leave you will be amazed of how much nice the staff are,as for the hotel and after staying in several hotels i rate it at one of the best regarding everything and i mean everything from staff,rooms,view and fooood ooohh its the real thing.if u wanna visit santorini then @san antonio is ur first choice",0
"Great rooms, great service (thank you Fani/Georgia), excellent restaurant and breakfast, quiet. Not far for Oia but would recommend renting a car at the airport. We will definitively come back to this hotel.",0
"From the moment we arrived we knew that we were in a superb hotel, the staff could not do enough. All of them - too many to mention - were attentive to your needs without being intrusive in any way. We arrived at night time and we could see that the hotel was immaculate, clean and fresh. What we woke up to the next morning was simply stunning with the views.",0

"A truly fabulous hotel. The staff are exceptional. Professional, helpful, friendly... they really are world class. And then there is the view. It is picture perfect. The rooms are comfy, modern and well equipped. Provided you are happy to rent a car, the location is fantastic. The hotel is outside of the main towns and so away from the bustle (and there can be a lot of bustle!) yet it is close enough to all the main sights. The stunning infinity pool and the excellent breakfast overlooking the Aegean add to the appeal.If there is one thing we would wish for, it would be for more privacy in the bathroom. What is it with modern hotels and open concept bathrooms? This was not the worst we have encountered, as there were actual (non-glass) walls and a door that closed. However, there were large windows without blinds and shutters that opened onto the bedroom... not helpful if you need to get up in the night and switch on the light...But all in all, we absolutely loved our stay at the San Antonio. We'll be back. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: Caldera view See more room tips",0
"Best location, best Hotel, best staff. Located between the city's of Oia, and Fira. Away from all the noise, cruise ship rat race and church bells. They ring all day and night in the city's. Only 7 miles to Fira and about 4 to Oia. Great free breakfast daily. First class staff from the front desk, restaurant , and house keeping. Very nice suites and all suites have a breath taking view. I stayed a week and never heard the word NO. Anything I ask for was answered with a ""Of Course"". The only thing I would suggest is getting a rental car so you can around the island. Cabs get pricey. I had a small call delivered to the hotel and I left it at the airport for 18 euros a day. When I tried to book a car from the USA it was 50.00 a day but only 18.00 when I hooked it there.   Room Tip: The airport shuttle is 30.00 euros per person each way. You can get a car for 18 euros a day. See more room tips",2
"What an amazing place! Only for grown-ups; we had the most perfectly relaxing 7-day break. Exceptional hotel, staff, food, levels of service and weather in a beautiful location on a stunning island. We will be back! :-)   Room Tip: All are suites with uninterrupted sea views and private terraces See more room tips",0
I could not be more happy that we chose the San Antonio hotel!!I have never been more satisfied with a vacation experience!! Allthe staff are so so friendly and kind and aim to please!!The hotel is more beautiful than pictures can capture! Location is perfect too! In a quiet place right in the middle of Fira and Oia   Room Tip: I don't think you can pick a bad room! See more room tips,0
"Superb hotel.. It really deserves SLH brand with an optimum hospitality from the beginning of your stay. Very warm welcome with a local sparkling(much better than you expect, Santorini is reputated with its wines). Wonderful rooms with bathtubes(as small jacuzzis), jacuzzi plunge pools with a private terrace & amazing view. Beds are more than comfortable. You don't have to go Oia to have drinks on sunset because hotel offers it in a very calm atmospher. F&B in the hotel is one of their strong , nicely presented and prices are normal. F&B staff Dimitris, Anna(2) and Lena are very professional and respond to all your requests even if it is a slipper lobster :)I really recommend for all couples who desire to have amazing times.   Room Tip: No 18 is highly recommended.. See more room tips",0
"How this place is rated #8 is unbelievable. People literally wouldnt move from the pool all day because the views are so amazing. One of the places that is actually more amazing than the pictures. The service and staff make it even better, they have the same people take care of you every day it feels like you have a personal butler. All the meals and drinks were delicious as well. Recommend doing the private sunset dinner for one of the nights if you are on your honeymoon.. That was awesome as well",0
"Everything was amazing in San Antonio, rooms, view, infinity pool, breakfast area, staff, service... Just everything! They gave us a complimentary upgrade to a jacuzzi suite! The whole experience was like a dream..We loved it, worth going back again!",0

"Amazing place to spend your vacation.... its very clean, staff are smiling and welcoming always.... i really enjoyed the food.... the room was spacious and infinity swimming pool.... i love the views of hotel",0
I came here for honeymoon. They had a bath tub problem with the room so they could not give us the room right away. They offered us free lunch at the restaurant. The food and view from terrace was amazing!!!! They informed us they could not fix the bath tub and they would upgrade the room. OMG! The view from the room was just unbelievable. It was all blue with sky and ocean!! Everything was just perfect!! Thanks!!!,0
"The stunning setting, amazing staff (nothing is too much trouble), delicious food and stylish rooms all mean there is nothing negative to say about the beautiful San Antonio. It's a very special place. And you won't find a better view! We loved our stay and can't wait to return!",0
"Amazing hotel so peacefull the views were stunning the staff were excellent the food was great . The room was spacious very clean loved it being in a cave.its out on its own so you need transport, in the day you can walk across the mountain into the town you need good walking shoes or trainers also in town cobbled streets a beautiful place to visit you won't be disappointed .   Room Tip: I think all rooms are excellent See more room tips",1
We did not stay in fhis property unfortunately but we had the best fine dining dinner ever. We did not have the budget to stay in but we had the pleasure to try also their spa. This has also been a very nice experience for both me and my wife. Its privacy and views blow your mind away. Do not hesitate to book it or even try their restaurant or spa. It does really worth its money. Great staff also. All members lead by Vania the manager were excellent.compliments to Anna from the restaurant and Alexandra from the reception.everyone with a great smile on their faces. Hope to come back and stay even for one night this time.thank you guys!!!,2
"I almost don't want to tell you about this place so we can keep this place for ourselves. San Antonio Santorini is the most beautiful hotel we ever stayed at in our lives. 5 star is not enough, the breakfast is yummy too. We stayed there twice & are already planning this years stay.",1
"My husband and I decided to stay at San Antonio to pamper ourselves a little bit, on an otherwise budget-designed trip to Greece. We arrived at the hotel late in the evening and we couldn't take the best advantage of the sunset views, but we were instantly impressed by the amazing property, the stunning views, the infinity pool, the sweet hot-tubs everywhere and the in-room jacuzzi! The spacious design, the stylish furniture and artefacts in the room were classy, chic and super luxurious. Besides the Free wifi, bottled water that most premier hotels provide, the turn-down service and wine in the evening elevated the whole experience. The staff were friendly and helpful. However I'm a neat freak and I did not quite appreciate the sight of the spare mattress that was set against the wall in the living room. They promised to remove it but never did. The sunrise was breathtaking and the lovely colours on the ocean dazzled us. The breakfast spread was sumptuous with a delectable array of dishes and the most amazing coffee and varieties of exotic cheeses. We missed using the infinity pool which would have been fantastic over the roaring Caldera, bit the constant drizzle in April (!) kept us away. Overall this was a pretty amazing stay and we would love to go back here some day for more!   Room Tip: The rooms too close to the cliff obstruct the view. Ask for a room at a higher level. See more room tips",0
"Went there as a group and we were welcomed by Kate and Alexandria(Wonderful hosts). They welcomed us with a drink and sat down with us to explain about the hotel, Santorini in general, places to see and dine. All their recommendations were very good and we went to most of the places that they suggested. They also made arrangements to rent a car.The view of the caldera from the room( which has a small sit out) and also in all the common places was just breathtaking. One can just sit there all day, do nothing and just enjoy the views this place has to offer. The breakfast had too many options( eggs to order, omelette, waffles, pizzas, cakes, pastries and list goes on :) and it was delicious.The rooms were also very spacious and the staff comes 2 times a day to clean your place and replace toiletries. It is in the middle of Oia and Fira and if you have your own scooter/ car it is easy to go around all the places.The only negative thing was that the WI-FI was bad but the caldera views made up for that :)I would highly recommend this hotel.   Room Tip: All rooms have fantastic views of the caldera!!!!! See more room tips",2
"This is a fantastic hotel in a fabulous location with a view to die for. The staff are fantastic, helpful with great tips of where to go or where to eat. The food at the hotel is to a high standard, all meals were excellent. I would fully recommend this hotel.   Room Tip: All rooms face the sea. See more room tips",3
"This beautiful hotel was the perfect spot for our visit to Santorini! It was a stunning location that we could walk to both Fira and Oia from depending on the day and come back for luxurious spa and massage treatments. If we didn't feel like walking to town the restaurant was wonderful with a terrific staff and even more magnificent view. Everything we wanted to do on the island was taken are of with ease from the front desk staff.. drivers, tours, taxi's, you name it. I can't recommend this hotel enough!   Room Tip: I personally liked our room on the ground floor but maybe during the high season you may want a room... See more room tips",3
"Perfect hidden gem with an amazing view of the caldera. Staff are awesome! Especially Kate and Alexis. If you're looking for a quite place away from all the crowds on the island, this is your spot! Very romantic, elegant, and relaxing. Also a great spot to hike the cliffs from town to town. So grateful to have found this hidden gem. FYI, wifi is everywhere but due to location is hard to use... Use their computer at front if you must use Internet   Room Tip: All have views of the caldera... Get one with a jacuzzi! See more room tips",0
"What can I say!! Absolutely everything was perfect from the moment we walked through the doors. The hotel is luxurious, impeccably clean, the staff are soooo friendly, polite and professional. We were upgraded to a senior suite which was amazing. The views and location of the hotel is just perfect. The maid service is very good, twice a day, bottles of water everyday, bed turned down. The pool area is lovely and sun loungers very comfy with fresh towels provided daily to use on them. Breakfast was lovely and we ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was exceptional. Fine dining at its best! All in all I cannot fault San Antonio suites and would only recommend it. Due to its location you would need to hire a car to get anywhere, but I think that adds to its draw being away from any hussle and bussle and hiring a car was nice to get out and see more of the island. My husband and I couldn't have wished for a better honeymoon week, pure relaxation in luxury surroundings. We would return in a heartbeat. From Mr and Mrs Mccusker x",2
"The good: Almost nothing comes under the word ""good"" because everything is EXCEPTIONAL. The hotel is simply stunning, the service is simply wonderful, the view is second to NONE. There's really not anything that cannot, at the very least, be described as good. The attention to detail far exceeds many hotels around the world who have a higher rating than this. It's simplicity is what makes it so utterly charming & the kindness of staff is what makes you feel special & taken care of. The breakfast is just amazing - in fact probably he best I've ever had in a hotel. It is made to order, fresh and incredibly tasty. There's bubbles should you want to indulge and fresh coffee made just for you. It can be delivered to the room but we enjoyed the small restaurant with its stunning endless views. The bad: Being picky, I was a little irritated to be expected to pay €5 to have any food delivered to the room. Not because it's an over the top amount of money but when you're paying such a premium to stay there, things such as room service should just be taken into account. There's no need to charge extra for it. I'd rather give the staff a €5 tip than it go to the hotel for doing nothing. The area around the pool does need to be addressed before someone really hurts themselves & I can foresee a lawsuit. However, just go steady and be careful - you don't want to be that person. Also, the location is further out. However, we didn't have any issues getting a taxi from or to either Oia or Fira. We also rented a car and as long as you have the confidence, you'll get used to the roads. Just take your time. The Ugly truth: if you really don't like this hotel then I believe it says more about you than the hotel. Small issues are not even issues and it's just simply a wonderful place to be, to relax and to indulge. Enjoy it for all it is. Breathe in the view. And know you've booked to stay in one of the most secluded, private and quite hotels on the island.",2
"This place is an absolute gem. The hotel is in a beautiful places with stunning views, a beautiful pool, the friendliest staff, and a relaxing atmosphere.And make sure to spend some time at the spa.I will see you again, soon.",0
"Amazing views - great hotel. The look was amazing. Rooms clean, service great. Kind staff and great people and location. Breakfast room service on patio is included! Soooo good. No issues there. However....We booked this a part of a Mykonos/Santorini trip. We were totally spoiled in Mykonos - so this hotel felt in some small ways a little disappointing. If they did a few simple things - it would be impeccable. The beds aren't comfy. For $600 a night, they should have epic beds. The shuttle service isn't great. Not entirely sure why they don't have trips back and forth to town at regular intervals. It's random - and the last trip back is 10:00pm ish. Way too early. Last hotel just picked us up when we called - anytime. Getting a cab is not easy in town, you'll wait up to an hour. We had a huge beautiful patio overlooking sea - as do all rooms. But why don't all rooms have loungers to lay on? Some do, others don't. We didn't. So, overall it's amazing. But if they spent a few bucks on those little things, it would be above and beyond.",1
"We spent one week at this hotel (our honeymoon) and had a great time. The view was amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful without being pushy. They helped us organize a photo shooting, wine tasting and ATV rental. We had a petit suite which was nice and clean. The only negative was the jacuzzi function of the bathtub. It was too loud and somehow there was water coming out of the water drain. But they fixed this immediately when we told the staff. The hotel is on a road, but one cannot hear the traffic well. It is a short distance away from Fira. We took the hotel shuttle a few times but liked to be more independent and so we ended up renting out an ATV to explore the Island on our own. We discovered nice beaches, great restaurants away from the crowds and a bit more authentic parts of the island. We also walked to Fira once (took us about 30 minutes) but I would not want to do it every day. It is also possible to take the hotel shuttle bus to Fira and from there the public bus to Oia. I am glad I did not spend more money on a suite with private pool because the hotel pool is very nice and not so busy. I would recommend organizing the airport pickup in advance if it is not in your vacation package included. There are many tourists and few taxis..",2
"Was a great place to stay, lovely view.service was amazing.room lacks top class details but overall an excellent stay. Would stay there again next time here. Location is OK but close to the port and provides transportation to Fira and back during the day.",0
"We've stayed only 2 nights but for sure going back. Nice, relaxed place with very good staff. Nefeli is the best - made the short trip even more enjoyable with the itinerary with places to visit on the island and the amazing lunch in Asterias in Akrotiri.",0
"My wife and I went to the Petit Palace for a much-delayed second honeymoon week away and we had a great time. The staff were helpful, very friendly and attentive. the facility was wonderful and the views were breathtaking. Lovely pool area with service from waitstaff. The restaurant is nice for breakfast, but we did spend our evenings in Fira or Oia, where there is a lot more variety. We would recommend the Petit Palace to anyone visiting the island!   Room Tip: All the rooms have great views. No need to splurge for the private pool rooms unless you need that... See more room tips",0
"My husband and I had the best three nights stay at Petit Palace. The minute we got there we were offered the most delicious sangria. The staff mainly Sofia and Fani were beyond welcoming and helpful. They set us up with a room upgrade which was great! They then got us an ATV within 30 minutes of requesting it, and gave us the best recommendations. We loved our stay and the staff really made it something special. The hotels location is just perfect! It was really a dream. Without a doubt, would go back in a heartbeat!",0
"My husband I visited Petit Palace this evening for dinner. We are currently in Santorini for our honeymoon. You must go here for dinner! We are staying in a local hotel, and were not disappointed. The view of the sunset was a delight (we ate outside) and the staff were super friendly. We ate at 8pm and stayed for 2hrs. We ate crab croquets and octopus for starters, and lamb and seabass for mains. We then shared the best dessert we've ever had (a chocolate ice cream with Strawberry biscuit). We drank prosseco and champagne cocktails. Everything came to about €120. Definitely worth it. We would highly recommend this restaurant. It looks like a wonderful place to stay.",0
"Wonderful 4 day stay at the Petit Palace. From the moment I walked in, the hospitality was exceptional and continued throughout the entire stay. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The wow factor was incredible when you first enter the property, views are absolutely breathtaking. Grounds are kept very clean. Room was beautiful. Pool area with view was spectacular. Food and drinks wonderful. Woke up this morning yearning for my Greek Breakfast....yogurt with honey, amazing cheese plate, cheese and spinach pie, how'll i'll survive now without...I do not know. Please note, hotel is not in the main part of fira, it is definitively on the outer edge...approximately a 25/30 min walk, but 5 minute drive. I rented an ATV which made all parts of the island easily accessible. Loved my stay! Hope to return again in the future!",0
"Checked in was swift and very helpful from general briefings of MUST-DO list while in Santorini, plus all the travel tips. Stayed in the private pool villa which is reasonably private and multi-storeys good enough for our group of 4. Pool veranda offered spaious and panoramic view of Caldera which we preferred than the busier bay around Fira and others. Staff were great and very pleasant everywhere, breakfast and dinner were great. Most of the guests opted for the in villa breakfast, we tried both and all were great to very good. Bathroom was in great size with reasonable amenities. Good and strong free WIFI all over the property. In all our 3 days gone quickly.Service desk were helpful and connect us to the taxi wherever we were in the island. In all this is our preferred resort, very peaceful area although not in the walking distance to the shopping area.ps. sunset here was as great as anywhere in Santorini.   Room Tip: best to get jacuzzi or pool villa and stay as high.... See more room tips",1
"Perfect hotel to stay in Santorini although outside Fira town.We very much enjoyed everything there: the awesome view, the swimming-pool, the breakfast, the way the personnel took care of us. Nefeli again as well as her colleagues were charming.We would love to come back as soon as possible.Even our teenagers absolutely loved it and declared it the place to stay in Fira.",0
Hotel is located a bit far from town (30 mins walk) but there are hotel shuttle service. It would be better if they can arrange it more frequent. All the staffs are friendly and very helpful during my stay. Breakfast is superb. You can enjoy watching the view of volcano at the same time. We love to visit again.,1
"Petit Palace Suites is the best place to stay in while visiting Santorini! We checked out so many other places around here but nothing comes close! The views are picturesque, modern and elegant, all the staff are extremely nice and welcoming and further going out of their way in making sure that your stay is perfect and memorable. Honestly, absolutely perfect! We will be definitely coming back next summer! :)",0
"On arrival in Santorini port, we were provided Complimentary pickup to the hotel. The checkin was smooth, Nefeli welcomed us and explained the best places to visit in Santorini along with maps and other tips. Also arranged for renting Bike.I enjoyed the stay in hotel with amazing views of caldera. The rooms are spacious and neat. Free Internet is ok.Its a few minutes drive to Fira, Kalmari beach and other places.Would definitely recommend this property.",0
"Mazing views and decent value for Santorini. The service has always been great with friendly, knowledgeable staff happy to point you towards good food and fun activities. The bar and the rooms offer breathtaking views and a perfect spot for the legendary santorini sunset.",0
"Super views, little off from the action as it is a 15 minute drive from Fira town, small pool, mediocre restaurant but overall lacking the finesse and personal touch to make it a great place. Staff is friendly as one would expect at a holiday resort.",0
"My husband and I enjoyed this relaxing hotel with amazing views. It is out of the main Fira town, so quiet at night. It is super easy to rent a car for a decent price so that you can get to any other part of the island. Shuttles are provided free of charge from the hotel to Fira about every two hours. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a little luxury on a smaller budget, this is a great hotel. The cave room we stayed in was spacious. It was a little older, but quaint and comfortable.",1
"When visiting Santorini, it's hard to go wrong anywhere you stay. The entire island is magical. Each of the towns have their own charm- Fira, Oia, Firostefani, Kamari, etc and there are many hotels to choose from. We were thrilled to choose to visit Santorini as part of our honeymoon travels. We couldn't have imagined a better stay than the one we had with Petit Palace. It is luxury is every sense of the word. Beautiful facilities, world class breakfast, and top notch customer service. The room was huge and fantastic. All of the employees were phenomenal- from the servers from the restaurant, to the pool attendants, to the guest managers. The one common critique of Petit Palace on Trip Advisor seems to be its location. It's about a 35 minute walk to Fira and a bit isolated on a road with some other luxury hotels. However, this was not a problem for us. It offered some quiet after long days and nights in the hustle and bustle. Also, we rented an ATV to get around the island during our stay which was AMAZING. It's not only the best way to get around without worrying about shuttles and taxis, but it's a blast. The hotel will accommodate all of your requests and needs like ATV rentals. Again, you really can't go wrong wherever you stay in Santorini. All in all, if your looking for a romantic, world class hotel in Santorini- Petit Palace is an excellent choice for you. Thank you Petit Palace staff!",0
One of the best hotels and experiences we have had. Staff were all friendly and helful looked after us and gave us our breakfast in our room with our frapper every morning. They were all appreciable. We got to know a few staff members Nico the bus driver was one of the best as he was helful friendly and was willing to help us carry our heavy lagguage.The room were great and spacious and very clean,0
"We were staying at another hotel in Fira and decided to treat ourselves to a caldera view for one night. I have never seen such a spectacular view as the Petit Palace hotel! Staff was accommodating, they helped us rent a car so we could explore Santorini and the breakfast we pre-ordered was brought to our room at our specified time in the morning and it was amazing   Room Tip: All rooms have great views. See more room tips",1
ALTHOUGH our booking in Fira was in a different hotel but due to some unexpected circumstances we were prayed to move to another hotel via our basic hotel on their own cost. So we were transferred to the petit palace hotel. The guys and girls there are really of ultimate kindness. They will make sure you feel like you.re home. You just ask and everything will come at ur service. A private bus is available on prefixed times to pick u from the hotel to fira centre which is 1.5 km only. BREATHTAKiNG VIEWS at petit palace like no other hotel in fira. Their breakfast is delicious and of various kinds. ONE FINAL ADVICE. LE PETIT PALACE will make ur stay in fira unforgettable. Wanna say big thanks to the girls on reception who were very kind and very helpful. Definitely Will get back to this lovely hotel.,0
"We stayed here for a short 3 night honeymoon following our wedding on the island. Beautiful island, fantastic hotel and very efficient, friendly, accommodating staff.The views from our balcony were stunning, the breakfast choice and quality (which can be served at your balcony) was brilliant. This is a special and quiet hotel, and hopefully one day we can return.   Room Tip: All looked great, but room 114(our room) was a little more secluded and stunning interior. See more room tips",0
"This hotel is absolutely amazing. I traveled here with my wife last week, and honestly, this is the best hotel I've ever been to in my life. I promise you the views from this hotel will be the best you've ever witnessed in your life. The service and staff here treated my wife and I with so much respect, and we connected with each and every one of them. The location of this hotel was perfect for us as it's central on the island, and just south of the Fira which I couldn't imagine staying in as it's quite loud and extremely busy with tourists. We rented an ATV which I highly suggest to get around the island; you could drive from one end to the next in about an hour. The rooms are perfect, nestled in the caldera, all with beautiful views.Lastly, a BIG thank you to Stathis, Fani, Sophia, Nefeli, Dina, Kris and Nektarios. You guys honestly made our trip the greatest of our lives. You are all incredible people, and we will never forget how great of an experience you made our honeymoon for us.",1
Truly unforgettable. The staff at Petit Palace insures your visit is exceptional. Every room has a breath taking view. The pool is stunning- sparkling clean with excellent service. Terrific location away from the crowds of downtown Fira and Oia.,0
"All staff (especially Fani) at petit palace were overly generous with their kindness, information and hospitality. The room was soo upscale and the complimentary fruits and wine really made us feel welcome! The hotel had one of the most stunning views, I dont not have one bad picture. The free shuttle from the ferry that picked us up and dropped us back made our trip all the more stress free. Great wifi, pool, air conditioning and transportation to the town. I would most definitely visit the hotel again and more than happy to recommend to family and friends. Thank you sooo much for making our stay such a pleasant one. Xavier Rodrigues (London)",0
"The hotel is superb in every possible way ! The team Greg Dina, Sophia , Nikos and the whole team members are helpful, cheerful and admiring.We had the best 3 nights, the room was very spacious and clean, the Jacuzzi in our room was amazing! The breakfast is wonderful and delivered to your room on daily basis. The last night we had a late flight so they offered a late check out.My favorite part in this lovely hotel is the main gate ,, the view is fascinating. You have to take plenty of pictures! Thank you Petit Palace Suites Hotel, you made us want to come back to this heavenly place .I will definitely visit again!",1
"One of the best hotel experiences ever! Very friendly staff, great rooms, very tastefull furnitures, very clean, great breakfast - everything freshly prepared and served to your room if you want to eat on the private terasse. Amazing view and Perfect location (15min walking distance to Fira).",0
"The hotel is located by the cliff and the lobby is already stunning. We are bless with clear blue sky ( I mean really Blue ). It's just look amazingly stunning. The hotel staff is very friendly and we have a very warm welcome. I rented a car from the Airport for about 90 Euro for 3D2N. Is about 10mins drive to this hotel.The hotel rooms are dug into the cave and it's very cooling, very nice experience.The balcony just infront of our room facing a volcano, the view is Speechless.One of the best resort ever. Santorini is a Paradise. The people around are friendly This hotel is just about 2miles from the city Fira. You can get all the thing you need there. If you don't drive, there is a shuttle bus.I can't describe enough, everything was phenomenal.It's just paradise in heaven",1
"Amazing stay, one of the best views on the caldera, far from the crowd of Oia or Kamari. I recommend also a visit to the winery that is close to petit palace, on top of the hill...Dinner was OK but not exceptional.",0
"This review is long overdue as we stayed at Petite Palace Suites Hotel for two weeks last year and I still think about that amazing trip all the time. The views from our cliff side hotel balcony, pool, and lounge were absolutely breathtaking. Our daily breakfast on the balcony was quite delightful. The onsite restaurant also had delicious food for the evenings that we decided to stay in and watch the sunset from our hotel. What made our stay so perfect was the wonderful staff there who gave us upgrades, provided us with information on the best tours and restaurants recommendations, and catered to all of our needs. I can’t say enough great things about this hotel, its views, and the staff there which made it the perfect vacation.",1
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel, everything was phenomenal! The location was perfect, it was right in the Caldera cliff side and a 30 minute walk to Fira where there was great food and shopping. The hotel was very generous to provide a shuttle to and from town from early morning to late night. From hotel views to service everything was amazing. The views from the lounge, to the pool and your balcony every day it was breathtaking. The Restaurant had very delicious food and it was reasonably priced. All their staff were friendly, knowledgable, caring and provided service that was exceptional. (Sofia, the Front Office Manager, and Chris one of the servers at their delicious restaurant). Nefeli, the Customer Relations Manager was amazing. She greeted us the moment we walked through the door, and provided us with an abundance of information about Santorini with a map and personal notes. You could tell she really cared about making sure our stay not just at the hotel but all of Santorini was an experience to remember, and she truly made our stay memorable. She was always willing to go above and beyond and she exceeded our expectations, the service she provided I will never forget. Nefeli is a huge asset to this hotel and the company, they are lucky to have her. My husband and I had a vow renewal on their cliff side balcony and it was extremely romantic. I absolutely plan on coming back to the Petit Palace Suites in addition to looking for other property's managed by Caldera in the future",0
"The hotel had spectacular views and was cleverly built into the hill over the caldera, but several things were frustrating enough that I don't think I would go there again. First, the rooms are rather cave-like with relatively small windows despite the stunning views. The rooms are also not built for tall people as the mirror came up to my chin and many ceilings were low. The most frustrating thing was the limited pool hours. We spent five hours walking in Thira and Oia and just wanted to swim, but they closed the pool at 7:30 pm for a private dinner. I talked them into letting me jump in and immediately get out, but that was a big disappointment. Breakfast was amazingly good with the view of the volcanic island and sailboats. Also, transfers from port were costly, but offset by free occasional shuttle into Thira town. Consider these comments before spending the money here.",0
"If you are looking for a boutique, 1st class hotel with most amazing views and service, then consider this on your short list. Situated just outside Thira town centre, peaceful yet close enough to access if you choose. An approx. 30 min stroll in to town or 5 min drive journey (hotel provides multiple free shuttle services in & out daily).Our 2nd visit at the Petit Palace, and they did not disappoint.Top line pros;Staff truly amazing, mgmnt through reception, pool area, restaurant, cleaner-friendly, professional, always have time to make sure you are ok.Location close to Thira (not on door step, but close enough to long walk or quick ride in free from hotel shuttle or 8EURO taxi)Views are caldera and truly spectacular. Boutique hotel, looks stunning, very clean, modern, minimum guest occupancy, romantic, chilled atmosphere.Breakfast as part of stay (served in restaurant or to room)Free wifiImprovements could be (minimal);Pool can be cold at times (when weather extreme heat, not such a problem). Opportunity to broaden food menu (what is served is fresh and tasty)We are well travelled, do not usually repeat hotel stays, but have on this occasion-100% recommendation - enjoy...",1
"Beautiful and stunning hotel, just like the pictures, the only thing I could pick is the rooms could be a little more luxury , but I think they are all similar in the style around here, the staff are all LOVELY , very genuine and warm. Would definitely recommend this heavenly location!",0
"Frankly, finding a cliff-side resort without a stellar view in Santorini is challenging, as pretty much every direction you look is picturesque. The location was ideal for us however, just about 10 minutes from the airport and slightly to the south of Fira. While Oia is probably the most desired city in Santorini, we found Fira to be plenty charming as well and the free shuttle service into town was quite useful. As soon as we entered we knew we'd made the right choice. The service was impeccable and catered to any possible need, and the room upgrade was certainly welcomed. Our room seemed to be built from a cave, with a patio and private pool to boot and spectacular views of the sea and volcano. Oia is apparently the place for sunsets, and we witnessed one there as well, but it just didn't compare to the one from our patio; though the Rose' from Santo Wines and privacy probably assisted our preferences. The hotel itself could use some upgrading, and there were a few details lacking here and there, but due to overall experience I'm definitely giving this place five stars. For the price point it's hard to beat, the views were amazing from every angle, and the breakfast in the mornings on our patio was top notch.   Room Tip: Splurge for room with a private pool. Honeymoon suite was lovely, but a higher level suite with bui... See more room tips",0
"This property gets a lot of 5* reviews and it is certainly good but it isn't cheap either so I have given 4* as there is room for some improvements. We had one of the maisons with a private pool. The room on two levels was comfortable and furnished in a simple style. Note that there is no handrail on the marble steps between the floors so not got good if you are not 100% stable, would not be legal in the UK. The bathroom was huge but the shower a little small considering and the shower head could either be at waist level or well above head height which seems odd. The Jacuzzi bath is also huge but we didn't bother to run it, conscious of how precious water is on the island. The breadfasts were good and you have plenty of opportunity to mix and match. We had it in the room every day and enjoyed the view but note comments below. We dined in the restaurant once and the food was good, as was the sunset view, but the menu is quite limited and there is not much atmosphere. We had a room service meal one night and it was the same menu as the restaurant but the quantities were very small. The balcony on the first floor has fantastic views but does lack any shade and gets the full sun for most of the day and it does have not have any side cover which would increase privacy and provide some protection from the frequent strong winds. So the wind restricted sitting out for breakfast and the lack of shade sitting out later. Each maison has its own pool and they are reasonably sized and attractive but the water is cold. We were mid June and it may heat up later but for the cost I would have expected the pool to be a little warmer and hence more inviting. Perhaps telling that we only saw two other people in any of the pools during the week. There is a sunshade umbrella by the pool but it is not adjustable and is bolted to the floor and certainly in June the shade it throws is over the pool not where you can sit. The glass screens round the patio are good at reducing the effect of the wind while still allowing you to see the view. The overall hotel, which is on many levels with steps, is very attractive and the staff were superb and it was a great week. So in summary it has all the potential to be really good 5* but does need to address a few issues",0
A wonderful experience staying in this beautifully designed hotel. The views are truly amazing and the whole atmosphere is of peace and tranquility. The staff are so helpful and they cannot do enough to help all your needs. Thank you to everyone.,0
"The Petit Palace is a boutique resort seeking to attract couples looking for seclusion away from the hubbub of Thira (Fira). If only you could find it. The resort is two kilometres before Fira on the main road. It is built onto the wall of the caldera, perched on the cliff face itself, making it entirely invisible. The only evidence of its existence is a low wall into which is a pair of white doors with a sign the size of an A4 paper on each side of the portico with the resort's name, carefully hidden by two potted shrubs. The name is also written in the pebbles leading to the portico. Instructions on their web site are absent and google or Apple maps are of little assistance. Once you have found it, the personalised service from reception staff is very pleasant. They will walk you through the facilities available, give you the wifi password and the breakfast menu as well as timings of the shuttle bus to Fira (6 times a day).Good luck trying to login! It must have taken about 15 times to be told ""incorrect password for petit palace"" before finally being able to logon. If you then move from one part of the resort to another or remain inactive for a couple of minutes you then start all over again, having to re-enter the password. This takes seclusion to an entirely new level. This seclusion continues with breakfast. You order the night before, choose an available time and it is served on your private terrace. No buffet style breakfast is available and the restaurant would only seat about 8 couples. This is not a resort for groups or kids. It is more a secluded honeymoon style resort.We stayed in a petite suite and the couple we were travelling with stayed in a petite maison. The suite was a room slightly larger than a motel room with a good size bathroom containing a spa bath with shower over the bath. The maison was built over two levels with a separate sitting room and terrace, a bedroom, very large bathroom with a jacuzzi and its own swimming pool. The beds are firm but there are only two pillows in each room. The furniture in the suite seems to be upmarket IKEA and the TVs are small. For those looking for a secluded resort with great water views wanting to work on their tans, lazing by the pool and away from the crowd then this resort may suit you, once you find it.",0
"When arriving at Petit Palace you are greeted immediately by a breathtaking view of the caldera. The hotel sits on the side of a cliff overlooking the Santorini crater, providing each suite a stunning view from its private balcony.The suites are very comfortably appointed, and beautifully designed. Guests have a choice of breakfast in the restaurant, in their suite, or on their private balcony. All the staff are friendly and eager to personally assist the guests. The location is close enough to the main city of Thira to be convenient, and far enough away to be peaceful. Periodic shuttle buses are available to transport guests to nearby Thira.",0
"This review is coming two years too late and I didn't have a 2014 option when selecting the year of my visit - but I figured better late than never and I just wanted to write a well -deserved glowing review of this hotel. My husband and I stayed here in July 2014. We visited Greece for our honeymoon and wanted to go all out in Santorini so we booked a room with Volcano view, which is part of Caldera Collection Hotels. Prior to reaching Santorini, we received an email saying that we had been upgraded to Petit Palace - which was also part of Caldera Collection. We were picked up at Thira port and upon reaching the hotel, realized we had been upgraded to stay in the royal suite for one night and the honeymoon suite for the remainder of our days there. I cannot emphasise enough what a magical stay we had here, and I'm confident that had we not been upgraded, we would still be raving about our stay as well. Top-notch service, polite, kind and efficient staff, and a beautiful location; we saw the legendary santorini sunset from this hotel, and the view from here beat that from any other lookout point on the island. Deciding what to eat for breakfast was our favourite part of the day, the menu was absolutely fantastic and boasted a delicious variety. Food at the restaurant was also delicious, and the band was lovely. Everyone at the hotel was always ready to help us with anything we needed, and made sure we enjoyed our stay. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, and staying here was the highlight our trip. One of our best holidays to-date a trip that is very memorable and dear to us. Thank you for everything Petit Palace Suites!",0
"Perfect holiday at a beautiful location! From the very beginning of our trip, the hotel staff could not have done more for us. They were so welcoming, friendly and helpful. Nefeli Avda, the Guest Relations Manager, was amazing and made our stay extra special. Highly recommended hotel!",0
"We stayed at Petite Palace June 4-6 for 2 nights. When we first arrived Nefeli greeted us and gave us a thorough orientation of the hotel as well as the island, places to go, etc. This was perfect for us as this really helped us make sense of the research we did before hand and plus she provided suggestions for an itinerary for our time in Santorini. Absolutely loved how personable she was and how comfortable/welcomed she made us feel, especially with us visiting for the first time! The rest of the staff was great as well.Ok, about the hotel: PROS:- Clean, rooms spacious- Amazing Views (especially sunset)- Central location of you plan to visit both ends of the island, reasonable close to wineries - Great and attentive staff- Great pool and private pools- Delicious breakfast and dinner, loved how you have an option to eat it in your room on the terrace or at the restaurant - Nice drive up without having to hike up/down crazy amount of stairs- On the edge of Fira, 5 mins from city center (8 Euros for a taxi ride but there are free hotel shuttle times) - more quiet, which we were looking for CONS:- Bed was a little stiff, would be nice if was more 'cushy'- Decor was relatively modern but the chair and the comforter are a lil old fashion (70s quilt) and there was a quilt on the sofa upstairs with the color schemes not particularly matching - Shower was a little odd, looked like a spaceship, would've been nicer if it was a standard walk in shower or tub/shower combo",0
"The Welcoming Greeting by the General Manager set the tone for a splendid week that exceeded all our expectations. Not only was the view amazing but so were the breakfasts on our balcony each morning and dinner at their restaurant Ella for a night in. The staff pampered you and serving ambassadors for the hotel as well as Santorini in scheduling day trips. Every member of the management and staff took prides their jobs with careful attention to every detail. Petit Palace should be your go to hotel on the island. We loved it! Friends from Dallas, Texas.   Room Tip: Every room is a good room See more room tips",0
"Me and my husband stayed in petite palace for our 1st wedding anniversary and it was nothing sort of a delight. Had a lovely suite to us with an amazing view of the caldera. Awesome breakfast every moring served at your terrace or at bed , the way u like it. Friendly staff and good service. Has a lovely lounge and pool area with awesome sunset views.The hotel has a unique architecture with true Greek elements, Frequent shuttle service to Fira made it very convenient to get to the city.You can be sure to have a good time here , totally unforgettable.   Room Tip: Higher floors have a better view See more room tips",0
"I simply loved this hotel. Its very quiet, guest friendly and the view from everywhere - its fantastic. The only downside was that its slightly far from the main town of Fira. But again , when you are in Santorini , a private ride is a must.",0
"We stayed for two nights after a few days of hiking. It was great. Everybody in the staff was really nice and helpful. We felt that it was important for them to see us enjoying ourselves. We were especially helped by Neffeli (Ihope I spelled her name correctly) but all the others were kind and helpful as well. The room was spacious and convenient, though there are certainly nicer rooms in the upper floors. We had dinner one evening and lunch the other day, Both were good. The service made all the difference: they just do everything professionally and with positive attitude.And the view...what can be said about the view that has not been said yet? The fact that the hotel is out of Fira is a great advantage, in my opinion. They have shuttles to town, but you just will never want to leave the hotel`s grounds.roundings",0
"I cannot praise enough our stay last week at Petit Palace.EVERY single member of staff deserves praise for their customer service. Your every need is anticipated. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade for my & my husbands birthday. The views are spectacular. We initially had a Grand suite which was luxury, however our upgrade left us speechless.Breakfast served on your balcony was extensive & fresh.",1
"The views when you enter the hotel are truly amzing, it is excatly how you imagine santorini to be. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpfull to solve small problems or to book activities ( the catamaran tour was a highlight of our stay) we booked a grand suite room and the first day there was a problem with it so we got an upgrade for one night to a maison room type witch was even more beautifful , the grand suite rooms are a little simple in decoration, the shower in the jacuzzi is not convient as the ceiling is very low and you can almost not stand in it. The fridge is very lound and we had to switch it of , those are small things but to fully enjoy the hotle if i return i would go for the maison type of room. The breakfast was amazing and the bar, lounge area beautiful especially at sunset. The location is indeed a little far and shuttles are at times far apart, getting taxis to return is not always easy as there was always quiet a wait at the station.",0
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Petit Palace for 3 nights in May and it totally exceeded our expectations! The view from the room was absolutely stunning. It is located about a 5 minute drive right outside Fira and we loved that because the hotel was a bit quieter than the actual Fira town. All of the staff were SO great and helped us book a few excursions. I HIGHLY recommend staying here, we had the best time!!",0
"My wife and I spent 8 nights here. There is no doubt that this place is a gem. Nevermind the steps. Use the elevator if you need. We used it twice and were on the third level from the bottom or the fourth from the top. When you plan to stay here plan and rent a car or a quad. The whole island is within 20 minutes of the hotel and driving is a breeze as long as you are careful. Park in any of the designated areas. Need a toilet? The hotel is usually a good point to stop off at while exploring. Walking to town is a task that likely takes up 25 minutes of your time each way. The hotel has space for free parking. The hotel is like small to the point where you ask ""where are the other guests?"".The room we stayed in was the Grand Suite which has two rooms and a large bathroom. There was some noise over the bedroom when breakfast was served in the morning earlier than we wished to get up but we slept through most of this. While breakfast is served in your room if you choose we chose to have breakfast at the restaurant simply to get out of the room for a change. Even though the breakfast was exceptional we also chose to have breakfast at other venues on the island on a few mornings. The staff was worried that they hadn't done a good enough job with the breakfast which was included in our room rate and fussed over us to check and even called the room to let us know they were open until 11.30am to serve us breakfast. The front desk arranged reservations for restaurants and tours and took time to explain aspects of the island that made it easier to plan our days. The view from the hotel is fantastic. Many passers by stop at the hotel parking to take photos during the day and especially at sunset. Sunsets are a feature of staying at this hotel. You can enjoy them from the patio at the room. From the rooms you can also see the activity in the Harbour which is the caldera of the volcano that forms the island. You can count the cruise ships and plan a visit to downtown to coincide with the bustle of a crowded town or one with fewer visitors. The ferries to the other islands leave from the nearby port and are fascinating to watch as they rapidly enter and exit the port area. The airport is only a comfortable 15 to 20 minute drive and the roads are respectable even if some of the traffic is confused. Remember most of the drivers are there for the first time(too).Thanks to. Stathis, Fani, Sophia and Nefeli. Please visit us in your offseason.",0
"We stayed here for 7 nights in May . The hotel is surrounded by beautiful views; waking up to the sea and volcano view each morning and the lovely sun set each evening was incredible. The room was a good size, I did think it would be bigger than it was but it had plenty of room. The bathroom was equipped really well with products and handy things such as vanity kit , sewing kits, shower caps etc. The bath tub for us was not a problem but it was on the high side so getting in and out needed care. The drainage for the bath tub was in the centre of the whole bathroom which meant the second person coming in are coming into a wet bathroom floor. Not a huge problem but if there was drainage in the tub itself it would be better.The bed was comfortable and room had robes towels and slippers provided.The room did not have a kettle and tea/coffee available , it was needed but pointing out the difference between there and most hotels I've visited. Breakfast was complimentary and very tasty. they were very flexible with extra requests or changes. They offer a pastry basket with traditional and continental pastry and breads. There is also all bran cereals, cheese, breadsticks, eggs, toasts, toasters, omelettes- plenty to start off the day. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Dinner again the Restraunt was flexible and made us a special requested meal as we are vegetarian. The sauce used for pasta was fabulous the best we had had on the island. Again the staff are brilliant very attentive. The reception area and general staff are all fabulous extremely friendly , helpful and readily available for any assistance The hotel grounds are beautiful and a lot of effort is put into keeping it immaculate and bug free. There is a free shuttle service to Fira town centre which was handy The hotel can also arrange buggy and car hire which was very convenient as well as excursions. We had a pleasant stay and would visit again and recommend it to others.",0
"We have never ever stayed in such a lovely hotel. The views are breathtaking. Both my wife and I were so touched by the beauty of the place and the caring friendliness of the staff that we often caught ourselves with tears in our eyes. Yes, it costs a bit more and one has a right to expect a bit more but it's still worth it and we both felt that the staffs interest and care was genuine. The restaurant is out of this world and the lounge area on a sunny evening is beautifully designed. The only slight downfall was our room. It wasn't bad. It just didn't have the star quality the rest of the hotel had. But the lovely breakfast served on our balcony each morning weighed up for this. A massive thank you to all the staff and esp to the young guest manager who had star qualities. Where ever we choose to go next will have a very difficult act to follow. Mar",2
"Could not fault this place at all, great staff, fabulous suites, lovely restaurant and some of e best views in the world (I kid you not!). Nefeli, the guest manager is a superstar and could not do enough for us. A fantastic time - WE WILL BE BACK   Room Tip: Some suites had private pools which were lovely but the main pool never seemed to get busy See more room tips",0
"PROS: The hotel has an undeniably amazing view. Unlike the hotels in Oia, no one is overlooking you and you are not overlooking anyone else, so it feels very private and relaxing. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Every person we spoke to enquired whether we'd had a nice lunch/trip/dinner and have plenty of information about the island.Breakfasts are pretty good - plenty of choice and you can have it in your room (at no extra cost) or in the restaurant.Room was a good size, clean and comfortable.CONS:Hotel is a bit out on a limb - a 30 min walk South of Fira. Definitely not 20 mins as they tell you in the hotel - perhaps that's so they can claim it's closer to Fira than it really is. There are shuttle buses into Fira but they're not very frequent and do not run past 9:45pm. Other little niggles which prevent it from getting 5 stars: as others have mentioned the jacuzzi bath when operated smells of sewage. Yuk! The faucet is calibrated the wrong way round (hot gives cold water and cold gives hot water). There are no pillows on the bed on arrival. Hairdryer is a teeny travel one which took approximately 30 mins to half-dry my hair. When the fridge was on, the constant dribbling and dripping sounded like a water feature so we turned it off at the wall. Cocktails are poor, but expensive.No deal breakers but all things which, with a little bit of effort, would upgrade the experience a bit.",1
"This hotel has an amazing view of the volcano and is beautiful. However, you either have to rent a car or take a taxi. Too far to walk anywhere. Also, it is very univiting. The lounge is pretty much non existent. The pool is only open from 1130 am to 730 pm. The pool bar same. It is not the place to go if you want to feel comfortable. Disappointed. Far better to stay in Oia.",2
"We stayed here in April with our four month old baby. It was our first trip away with her, so we were looking forward to a nice time but didn't really know what to expect.Firstly, the hotel is stunning. Incredible views from all over the place, and I would say that every room would have had a stunning view. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a larger suite which made our stay even more comfortable and gave us even more space from which to enjoy the view.Breakfasts were amazing and I loved the fact that you could have it bought to your room. This was a really lovely touch and was great for us with a baby, but make perfect sense for anyone as it meant you could enjoy the view and your lovely breakfast and feel like you had it all to yourself.The food in the restaurant was very nice indeed and I enjoyed eating there, but the selection was slightly limited if you are staying for a long time and I would say quite expensive if you planned on eating there a lot. There is lots of choice if you take the free shuttle bus into Fira though.Finally, what made it amazing were the employees there. The service was always impeccable and delivered in a friendly, helpful and genuine way. Throughout our time, we were always looked after and they really helped us out with our room upgrade as well as when we needed a late checkout due to a late flight. Genuine thanks to them all for this.All in all, an excellent hotel and would not hesitate to recommend.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Petit Palace for just three nights and I wish it was more! The team is just incredible. They checked us in five hours early and the amazing staff were so attentive the entire time we were there. The suites are fantastic, the breakfasts the best we had on our trip and the free shuttle in and out of Fira is great and gave us plenty to do for our three days in Santorini. The sunsets from the hotel pool and the restaurant are spectacular and the facilities are five star. It really is a hidden gem and every guest I spoke to was overwhelmed with how beautiful the hotel is and how luxurious its facilities are. I would recommend staying here as its close enough to Fira town, but also a relaxing escape for those looking for romantic getaway. We will definitely be back!   Room Tip: Higher floors have a better view, however there are fantastic views from the restaurant and pool See more room tips",0
"A cliff top suite hotel. Stunning views from all balconies. Although it can be a little windy.Facilities in the rooms are good, functional and clean. The hotel lacks atmosphere in the small restaurant. Ensure you complete your breakfast choices early to secure your desired breakfast time of eating in the restaurant. Alternatively take advantage of breakfast on your terrace. The hotel has a pool with decking area suitable for those sun worshippers.The hotel offers spa treatments but again lacks a spa. Treatments are delivered In your room and therefore lacks the traditional spa atmosphere. However treatments are good. Delightful staff, nothing to much trouble. A 30 minute ish walk into Fira, the islands main town, alternatively you can take advantage of the complimentary hotel shuttle. Not much else, entertainment going on at the hotel. There is not really a bar for evening drinks, although drinks available in the open aired deck.",0
"This is our second visit to the Petit Palace. The hotel and staff are wonderful. Could not fault anything. Returning to this hotel is to meet up with old friends as that is the way it feels. The management and staff are brilliant and try and help with any request.Breakfast is wonderful whether served in your room or at the restaurant. Evening meals in the restaurant are wonderfully prepared and presented, and a special mention must be made of some of the restaurant staff, Konstantina & Chris (serving), Vaggelis (chef) and Marios (Sous chef).We will be back next year. Thank you to everyone  Room Tip: Room 122 - wonderful, quiet and secluded with the best view in the hotel See more room tips",0
"Views that will take your breath away! Lovely staff, food, pool & rooms. We celebrated our anniversary here and were not disappointed. Shuttle bus takes you into Fira were you can have dinner, view the sunset or shop!",0
We have just returned from this hotel and cannot find fault with anything ! The hotel is overlooking the sea and the volcano. It has just 20 rooms all of which are spotless. The staff are totally efficient and cannot do enough for you. Food is excellent. The hotel is situated just outside Fira and taxi ride to town is 8 euros. There is a courtesy bus but we preferred taxis. We travelled as two couples but there were lots of honeymoon couples here. Thankyou to all of the staff for making our holiday so special.   Room Tip: There are several standards of room some with own pools. See more room tips,0
"My daughter and I stayed at the Petit Palace for 9 days. It is the most beautiful hotel with fabulous views. The hotel is located on its own property, about a 20 minute walk from the town of Fira. We stayed in a room (Maison Mansion) with private pool with extraordinary sunset views each night. Nafelli and Sophia went beyond the call assuring all our needs were meant and confirmed activities, taxis and restaurant reservations. I highly recommend this hotel and will return.",0
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights mid April. What a gorgeous hotel. Our room was beyond fabulous. It was two stories with a huge, comfy bed and an amazing bathroom. We even had our own private pool. I stuck my feet in it. It was too cold for me but I saw others using theirs. The view is out of this world. The pictures just don't do it justice. You've got to see it to believe it. The included breakfast was fantastic. They give you four types of breakfast for you to choose from. I ordered the Greek, and husband had the honeymooners. You could add on different styles of eggs, bacon, etc. So good! Service was top notch. From Nefeli at check in, to the young man who was always outside reception waiting to assist you, housekeeping, breakfast bringer--all extremely well trained. A memorable stay.",1
"I recently stayed at this lovely hotel overlooking the Caldera outside of Fira. The service was extremely attentive and accommodating. The room was very large and clean, with a lovely patio where breakfast could be delivered in the morning. For Americans, the shower is a little challenging. There is a hook above the tub where you can put the detached shower head; however, ours angled toward the wall and was very short, making it impossible to use in that position. It didn't really bother us because we were there for a short time, but I could see how it would be challenging for very tall people or if we were there for a week. Also, our bathroom sink had issues draining which was a little frustrating.The only other issue, which we knew when we booked, was that the hotel is a decent walk to Fira. I guess I thought the walk would be prettier than it was, but it was along the busy road on a sidewalk with a lot of trash. It would be nice if the shuttle from the hotel to Fira ran a little more frequently. All in all, though, it was a romantic, lovely hotel with great service and I would recommend it to couple who wanted a quiet getaway.",0
"We are just back from our trip to Santorini where we spent 3 nights at the Petit Palace. We can’t say enough about this hotel – the rooms, location, staff were outstanding. It was an incredibly memorable trip and we are already planning a visit back.- Location is outstanding and very close to Fira. The hotel provides a free shuttle.- The view of the caldera is nothing short of amazing. We never got tired of it, absolutely gorgeous!- Hotel amenities which include the spaciousness of the rooms, delicious breakfast, pool and reception areas all terrific.- Staff is over the top helpful, especially Nefeli who went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She had restaurant reservations for us each night, arranged for a cab pickup, recommended a catamaran cruise (which is a must!!). She even arranged for a late check-out after finding out about our late departure. Incredibly thoughtful and kind.If you are planning a visit to the beautiful island of Santorini, don’t hesitate to stay at this hotel",0
"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon a few weeks ago and absolutely fell in love with this hotel. The facilities, rooms, staff and not to mention the views are amazing and really made our 5 night stay in Santorini one to remember.We were picked up at the airport by the hotel and the check-in process was quick and efficient. Nefeli was excellent during the check-in process and provided us with information on the hotel facilities and the island. We had booked the Petit Suite which included a separate lounge area and Jacuzzi bath. Breakfast was also fantastic and you have the option of being served in the hotel restaurant or your room/balcony. Free Wifi is also available in your room and in most common areas of the hotel.The hotel mini bus provides transfers to Thira and once in Thira you have access to shops, restaurants and amazing views. The bus station is also located in Thira which is considered the best way to travel across the island and not to mention cheap. Be sure to ask for the bus timetable in reception.The staff at the hotel are a credit to the hotel, they really made our stay comfortable and memorable as they would always go out of their way to assist guests in any way they could. Sofia in reception was fantastic as she would always go out of her way to assist with any queries and provide advice on the island. Stathis was also very helpful and not to forget the gentleman who bought us our breakfast every morning (sorry forgot his name). Nefeli was also amazing and would always ask us if we needed anything every time she bumped into us. The staff at Petit Suites are a credit to the hotel and the rest of the Caldera Group.Overall I could not recommend this hotel enough. The hotel is in a fantastic location with the best views Santorini can offer. If you are planning a visit to the beautiful island of Santorini, do not hesitate to book this hotel as you will have a wonderful and memorable visit.   Room Tip: Petit Suites provide a separate lounge area See more room tips",0
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights it was absolutely perfect. Everything about it from start to end was 100% brilliant. We got upgraded to honeymoon suite on arrival which has its own pool which was such a lovely touch and the room itself was perfect. The hotel has the most amazing views and is a corner of paradise. I cannot say enough how amazing it is. The staff are so lovely and very accommodating too. They cannot do enough to make your stay perfect. We hired a catamaran on our second which they organised for us which we strongly advise to do. We will definitely be visiting again,0
"We visited Santorini just as the season started, so the sun was shining, but a little chilly.We stayed at Petit Palace, and the moment we stepped through the quaint little doorway (we drove past the hotel entrance twice before spotting it!) we were impressed, and that never stopped. We felt welcome, felt at home, and felt like we were in a tranquil paradise.The hotel has amazing views, is quiet, is immaculate, has amazingly helpful and calm and friendly staff. The room we had was lovely, and were fortunate to also stay in one of the maisonettes too. Simply fantastic, and feels a little indulgent too!I can't rate this hotel highly enough. My partner is an air hostess, so we've been to a more than a few places! Thank you to all at the Petit Palace for such an experience and memorable trip.   Room Tip: Maisonettes are amazing. A lift is available to some areas. Lots of steps (side of the volcano of co... See more room tips",0
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days and it was nothing short of amazing. It really was just something else! The staff here are just so unbelievably friendly and knowledgeable and I felt so pampered the entire time I was here.And the view. Omg. Every room had an amazing view of the sunset as they're all facing the water and each room had a little terrace/patio in the front with a little patio furniture where you can sit and enjoy their complimentary breakfast each morning.. Which is also out of this world!! There are 4 or 5 different breakfasts to choose from and it's delivered to your room, or you can have it in their restaurant, anytime between 8am and 1130am. The rooms were clean, the bathrooms each had a big jetted tub, and you pretty much got whatever you asked for - towels, pillows, you name it. There were also individual AC units in each room. But because they're built into the mountains and are essentially little caves, it did get a bit stuffy but with the AC and the door open, I barely noticed it.And keep your eye out for this place because all there is to identify this place is their signature fence/door as everything (reception, suites) are below ground level. But it is along the main road maybe about 10 minutes outside of central Fira along with a whole bunch of other resorts/suites.And I would also recommend renting some kind of vehicle (atv, scooter, small car.. Easy to do at the airport for a car, and in Fira there are multiple little shops for all 3) because all the touristy things (Red Beach, Oia, Fira etc) are all on opposite ends of the island and I don't think I saw one bus there, and it gets expensive taxiing everywhere (flat rate of at least 10 euro each way). That being said, we went in the second week of April right before high season started, so I don't know how it's like when summer hits.All in all, this place is just a little gem and I would definitely return and I 100% would recommend this place to all my friends and family. It was truly an experience staying at Petit Palace.",0
"Took my partner here for her 30th Bday & we both thoroughly loved it! The Hotel has magnificent views of the caldera! Unrivalled for me! Hotel staff were amazing, couldn't have asked for better service. I ordered a bday cake & flowers with concierge & it was in the room on arrival, just as I requested. Attention to detail was second to none. Breakfast, which could be ordered to your room was great. Vast selection of breakfasts on offer. The pool area is stunning & the perfect way to relax & unwind. The hotel is situated about 10 mins shuttle bus journey into Fira town. Hotel give you a timetable on arrival & we used this service quite a lot. Handy as there is not much to do in the evening. All in all a magnificent hotel & highly recommend. I will be coming back that's for sure. 5***",0
"This is a wonderful hotel and the people employed here were amazing. Before I arrived I emailed them several times to ask questions and they always replied with a warm greeting and answered all my enquiries. We were collected from the airport (extra cost) and once we arrived we felt like we had landed in heaven. The hotel was beautiful and we had a wonderful view of the Caldera (volcano). Our room was lovely but we were upgraded to a superior suite which was out of this world. There is a free shuttle service which leaves several times a day into the main town and returns you. This was a really useful service. The breakfast set us up for the delay and was beautifully presented and served by Nechtarios (hope I spelt that right) a very polite and friendly young man. There is 24 hour room service and although there are no tea/coffee making facilities, you can order hot water to your room at any time. The concierge, Stathis, was very helpful in advising us of activities and arranging them. He too was polite and always greeted us with a smile. We were even brought a card, hand delivered by Stathis, every day telling us what the weather would be the next day. It's small touches like this which make you feel special. The two young ladies at reception, Sophia and Nefeli, were also very accommodating and friendly and every request we made to them was handled with a great level of professionalism as well as friendliness. We also need to mention the manager, Gregory, who helped make our stay a memorable one. I have stayed at many hotels around the world but this is by far the best, for facilities, service and location. I am so pleased to have stayed here and will be returning to Petit Palace very soon. Thank you everyone there and sorry I don't know the name of the girl who made us the cocktails and the man who brought us hot water. You are all a credit to your employers and your country!

"We were planning a couple of days in Santorini between tours of Greece and then Turkey. When looking for hotels, Petit Palace got our attention and we booked it for four very memorable nights.Its about 10 minutes from the airport, about 20 minutes walk from the classic ""downtown"" area on the side of a cliff looking out at the Caldera (the volcanic islands). Each room and the entire property has wonderful views of the ocean and surrounding areas. The staff is remarkable, particularly Nefeli at the reception desk.An outstanding breakfast is included in the rate and their are several choices, each of which can be delivered to your room or you can eat in the restaurant. The staff are great with recommendations on area restaurants and go out of their way to ask how the dining experience was when you return. The rooms are enchanting, all built into the side of the cliff. We travel a lot and have never felt so pampered.",0
"This hotel is amazing and their service is excellent all the way from the pick-up at the airport to check-out. During check-in, they will even recommend u some of the major attraction of Santorini and the must try food and restaurant. The room is spacious. The view from the room and the pool is awesome. I saw one of the most beautiful sunset during my stay.",0
"New restaurant open Falafel house in Fira I enjoyed and for Indian food there is Jaipur palace, and many More who give Parcels to your Hotel, my Breakfast was included I enjoyed it was yummy one should visit this place   Room Tip: I will be eagarly wating to visit Santorini Patit Palace again excellent Property See more room tips",1
Kind staffs and epic view from our room! The breakfast is so tasty and the Honeymoon one with omelette is my favourite. The hotel gave us free shuttle service! Convenient location and the best sunset view point!   Room Tip: All of them are excellent! See more room tips,0
"This hotel is a fantastic place for a couples getaway. It is a little expensive but as an treat is definitely worth a visit .Food good. breakfast excellent ,service staff attentive and professional..",0
"Absolutely breathtaking views from every room. Beautiful pool. Free, delicious breakfast delivered right to your door if you so choose. The service is incredible-- the receptionists will help out in any way possible. Would highly recommend.   Room Tip: All rooms are amazing! See more room tips",2
"First off, this hotel is absolutely breathtaking. The main entrance is through a little white wooden door and as soon as you step down on those long steps, you see the most breath-taking view. The best description is... you feel like you're above the clouds in heaven. My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon here and stayed in one of the villas. We loved every second of it. VILLA: 2 level villa with private pool, a indoor sitting area upstairs, as well as an outside balcony on the second level. the room has a king size bed and 2 baths. The room was beautiful, room service and maid service was excellent. And the view was absolutely amazing. We spent a lot of time at the private pool enjoying cocktails and the view. HOTEL: The service is amazing. Similar to most other hotels on this island, this is a small hotel and the service staff really tailor to your needs. LOCATION: The location of the hotel is far from Oia and 2km from the main town. The food options are limited to hotel area and we ended up eating at the hotel alot (whihc is pricey!) The location might be a negative for some, but my husband and I loved how quiet this location was, so we didn't mind paying for hotel meals (which were good). It was just so relaxing and serene. We walked to the main town one evening and it took us just less than 30 mins. The walk was beautiful! It was right along the wonder and the view!Overall, this is one of my favourite hotels from all my travels. I can't wait to go back!",0
"Certainly a spectacular hotel and of course with prices to match. Basic room (Petit suite) start at half a grand USD a day that is if you book ahead of time. We had booked the next category up which is Petit Grand Suite (few hundred bucks more) but didn't think that the room was really worth it. We were put at the lowest level of the rooms that fall right under the main booking area. Looks like those rooms are the first two categories and the next two categories are the ones towards the right with private pools etc. Those were really fabulous looking, literally something out of a travel magazine. So my recommendation is that if you are going to stay here better book one of the honeymoon rooms (top two categories) anything less than that you are just paying to stay in a luxury albeit a regular room at a hotel with breathtaking views. Also it is not in the main Fira city so if you prefer the hustle and bustle and being in the center of it all then this is not your place. But if you want a quiet, private and exclusive hotel where you want to relax and unwind then this is it. Breakfast was very good and is customized to your personal preferences but you need to fill up a form everyday to specify what you want the next day. The WiFi is extremely spotty and didn't get better even after complaining multiple times.There is a convenient store about 10 mins walk down the road if you need some snacks, water etc. Up the road is a mexican restaurant called Zorba which was surprisingly good. The shuttle service to Fira is a nice service that the hotel provides but make sure you don't miss the last one back because the taxi service sux big time. There are numbers posted everywhere to call a taxi but either you cannot get through or if you do the taxi still doesn't show up. The line at the taxi stand was at least 50-60 people all complaining, some waiting for more than an hour and half. We got sick of waiting and just hitched a ride in some van by requesting some locals who were kind enough to drop us back. Ok I apologize for going all over the place, but to summarize, like my title states, this is perfect for well-heeled honeymooners that can afford to book the top two category rooms.   Room Tip: Book the top two category rooms (honeymoon suites), any other category frankly is not worth it at th... See more room tips",1
"From the service to the wonderful view, I could not have imagined a more beautiful place to spend my honeymoon. My wife and I felt like celebrities the entire time. Breakfast brought to our Villa each morning was amazing and the best part was being able to walk out on our private terrace, along side our private pool, and look at the Caldera view. I can truly say that I have not seen anything more gorgeous in my life with the exception of my wife on our wedding day. I would recommend going to Santorini and staying at Petit Palace at least once in your life time. It is a life-changing, bucket list-worthy experience.   Room Tip: Make sure to get the Villa with the private pool See more room tips",1
"Petit palace took our breath away from the get go. We had our wedding here September 2015 and it was truly unforgettable from the view, the hotel room, the hotel team, the food everything was perfect! I would 100% recommend Petit palace! The hotel team are so friendly and helpful there's absolutely nothing that I could fault. Thank you so much for making our stay and special day truly unforgettable. We will definately be back :)",0
"There are only good things to say about Stelio’s Place. Free transport is provided to and from the airport at the beginning and end of your holiday. Stelios, and his family, Eva, Katrina and Voula are hospitality personified – nothing is too much trouble and they are lovely, friendly, happy people. On arrival we received a welcome basket of Wine, fruit and cake. Whilst we were there, the bedding and towels were changed every day and, in addition, we were loaned towels for the beach at no charge and these could be changed when necessary.The room was spotlessly clean and the equipped with air-conditioning (quiet and effective), small safe and fridge, all at no extra cost. There is a flat-screen TV too – but we didn’t watch it. The bathroom was also cleaned every day and was very much better than any experienced in hotels elsewhere in Greece.The hotel’s pool, like the rest of the hotel, was spotlessly clean and there is a small bar/snack bar alongside at which you can get a good assortment of drinks and snacks, including breakfast, soft drinks, beer, wine and cocktails.Being a bit sad, I paced out the distance from the hotel to the beach – 170 paces. The beach itself is large and sandy – the sand is the famous Santorini black sand. It’s course sand – almost grit – and be warned – it gets very VERY hot under foot! On the beach there are plenty of sunbeds and shades. The sunbeds are clearly “zoned”. Most zones belong to the various tavernas long the front and most allow you to use the sunbeds – and the tavernas’ wi-fi - for free if you buy drinks and/or food from them during the day. They’ll serve you on the beach. Do check, though: there are one or two zones that are not owned by tavernas. If you use those, you will be approached for a fee in the order of €10 per day per pair of sunbeds. Most people only make that mistake once!If (when) we go back to Santorini, We will definitely try to get into Stelio’s Place again. Unbelievable value for first class accommodation.",0
"The hotel is clean and the owners are friendly. It is a bit far from Santorini Island. In order to get there, you have to change the bus 2 times. If you are a budget traveller, it is a good choice for Santorini visit.",1
"We were looking for an authentic, good value, small family-friendly hotel as a base on Santorini. We were not disappointed - Stelios Place exceeded our expectations if anything. From Stelios himself meeting us/returning us to the airport to final farewells with the whole family and their smiles throughout our 10 day, we felt thoroughly cared for, welcomed and our custom appreciated - 5* boutique hotels with sky high prices could learn some serious lessons here.The hotel is brilliantly situated, just a minute from the black sands, clear sea and bustlig restaurants and shops of Perissa. Yet set back enough to provide an enclave of peace and privacy amidst bourgainvillea. All of the rooms - whilst quite basic - are spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds, balconies, fresh towels and even beach towels, fridge, hairdryers etc. Hotel life revolves around the equally spotless pool and small reception and terrace area, where breakfast, lunch, cocktails and snacks are served with the biggest smiles on Santorini. Bills can mount up as breakfast is not included, but the prices are favourably comparable with the rest of the Perissa competition, and some of the food delicious. Local car hire, excursions etc are all brilliantly easy to arrange, and there is no shortage of things to do, using this as a base.Perissa is perhaps not the most beautiful/romantic part of the island, compared to the steep cliffs and caldera views of Oia and Firastefani - but nonetheless a great choice for beach and water sports lovers, and certainly for families. We would have no hesitation in recommending Stelios Place to everyone. Stelios, Ava, Katerina and Voula (and cute dog Milo!) were a sheer delight and perfect ambassadors for their island. Utterly charming and kind beyond belief, especially with our son who they treated to crepes and fruit juices! It was difficult to say goodbye to such a special group of people who truly understand the meaning of hospitality. This place is a gem and deserves every success. Epharisto!",3
"If you go to Perissa, this is the hotel you have to stay at! If you don't go to Perissa, rent a scooter, drive around the island as much as you like, BUT this is the hotel you have to stay at! <U+2661> This family is lovely, they'll do everything possible to accomodate you and your requests. Food is delicious and smiles are always on their faces! Grazie di cuore, Noemi & Dimitar",1
"I just returned from a 5 day stay at Stelio's Place and it was an amazing experience. I think previous reviews have said it all: amazing hospitality from Stelios and his family, comfortable and relaxing accommodations and great location. I can't emphasize enough the truly one of a kind service that we experienced. Stelios and his family made us feel so welcomed and like we were part of the family. It is steps from the beach and we were able to go to Fira for dinner easily. I would love to come back and cannot recommend it enough!",1
"just returned home from a 4-day stay at Stelios place. location was perfectly situated near the beach - great if you want to go and see the sunrise. easy access to bars and restaurants along the front. most importantly the hospitality is the best - such a warm and friendly (genuine) welcome that you just dont get from the big hotels, thanks to all the family who do as much as possible to make sure you have a great time....thanks",1
"Ditto the lady below, we have left now for a further week in iOS where the hotel was exceptional the one thing it lacked was the staff of Stellios Place if only you could merge the two you would have a winning formula. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking to book anytime in Santorini as this place has it all delivered each day with a smile by such nice sweet charming people, we will be back ! Just hope can find a slot",1
"You get much much more! Believe the reviews this place is a little gem, hospitality 2nd to none. The room was quiet, spotlessly clean, clean linen and towels everyday and no matter what time we showered always plenty of hot water. The pool is quiet, clean and never had an issue finding sun beds.But the real asset is the family Stelios, Eva, Katerina and Voula can not do enough for you, from our lift from the airport and welcome basket we knew we had chosen well, all are cheerful and helpful. We chose Perissa as a way to see santorini on a budget, but in hindsight it was the best decision as it is quieter and preferred visiting Fira and Oia as day trips, in my opinion Megalochori and Pirgos are equally as pretty but with a lot less tourists. Also food and drinks are much better priced in Perissa.We booked one excursion through the hotel to the volcano, hot springs and Tharassia 25e which was very interesting the guide who went up the volcano with us was very knowledgeable and told the story in an animated manner which would have been suitable for young and old alike, it is a bit of a trek though and I was glad I heeded Katerina's advice to wear trainers. The rest of the time we explored the island by the local busses after getting lots of information from the family, all buses go to Fira and then you change for your destination, or if you want to go to the red beach or Akritiri you change at the crossroads, just don't expect them to follow the timetable!! But they run about every half hour and the conductors are really good at making sure you get off at your stop.We also walked from the hotel up to the ancient ruins of Thira it is quite a steep climb but worth it, as is steeped in history again wear trainers! There are some donkeys that you can take up but be warned they only go as far as the car park and is still a way to go afterwards also it closes at 2pm so must be done on a morning.We had breakfast each morning at the hotel they offer English, continental, yoghurt and fruit and honey, omelettes and cereal all at very reasonable prices, we also enjoyed cocktails every evening at the hotel (5/6e) after trying Dorian's on the 1st night and not being hugely impressed. We ate out each evening and can recommend Gods Garden, Sirocco, Cyclades tavern particularly, we also liked the food at Ancient Thira restaurant but found the service somewhat lacking. All in all, a perfect holiday, would I return to Stelios place? In a heartbeat!",4
"Excellent accomodation.very clean and comfortable. We had an assortment of Breakfasts whilst there.also lunch snacks. They were very good, and well presented. The swimming pool was very clean. The staff were lovely, and went to a lot of trouble to make the Brides Birthday and Wedding day very special. The hotel was decorated with bows and flowers. Exceptional hospitality by a truly lovely family, thank you Stellios, Ava, Katrina and Voula.",0
Stelios Place is one of the best hotels in the Perissa beach area. It is two minutes away from the Perissa beach. The hotel is run as a family business but it's hospitality is no less than a big brand hotel. My stay was very comfortable. One can take the breakfast at the hotel or can walk on the beach road to find many tavernas offering healthy and pocket friendly meals. One can relax on the beach facing seats and can devour his/her meals. People in the locality are also very friendly. I strongly recommend the travellers to stay at Stelios place owing to the best in class hospitality and a Greek living experience.,1
"Just returned from a week in santorini,my husband and I have experienced true Greek hospitality. Lovely quiet family run b&b. Stellios Eva, Katerina & milo the dog all gave a true Greek welcome. Close to everything this b&b provides good clean accommodation . Nothing is a bother when they help you from bus timetables to booking trips. Fabulous hidden gem !!! Thank you for a great week and meeting some lovely people ",0
"Have just spent 10 nights at this lovely place. Stelios and his family made us feel so welcome from the minute we were picked up at the airport. Very peaceful place, 2 minutes from everything, lovely rooms, lovely food, especially the fruit, yoghurt and honey. (I thought I'd mention the healthy stuff other than the lovely egg and bacon on toast I also had for breakfast!)Nothing is too much trouble for this family, they go so out of the way to assist you with anything they can.4 star it isn't, but you wont get service like you get here in a 4 star, nor do I believe it would be cleaned as often. Fresh towels every day and room and beds cleaned and tidied. They even provide beach towels!I hope they have the success,that their hard work deserves.   Room Tip: They all look nice, but we had a sea view from the balcony in room 4 See more room tips",1
"The hotel is 5 minute walk away from Perissa bus station, surrounded by some very good restaurants. The deluxe double room we stayed in was clean and equipped with fridge, hair dryer and TV, and sitting in the balcony at sunset is cozy. What's more lovely than this place is the Stelio family. They are very helpful and attentive. We met two tourists who stay at this place every June for consecutive 15 years!",1
"This is our 3rd visit to Stelios place and each time is as good as the first. Stelios and the whole family make you feel really welcome, nothing is too much trouble. Stelios will meet you for stays of 3 nights or more, so saving the additional cost it a transfer to/from airport/port. The rooms are a good size and exceptionally clean, beds are comfy. Bathrooms are small but adequate, water is always hot. The families hospitality is second to none. We will be back!",1
"We spent eight nights here recently and even with a diverted flight to Athens and back to Thira, Stelios was there to meet us at the airport. That level of service makes anybody want to go back and enjoy their family hospitality. You are close to the beach but we had no evidence of noise at all, but yes, it was May and places were opening up for the season all the time.Katerina is extremely knowledgeable about things to do and see and will help you book trips. The bus service is very good but all roads lead to Fira from where buses to other places leave to other parts of the island Euros 2.30 one way.One place that is well worth visiting is Megalochori - the bus will drop you very close by. A lovely little village that is very close to Stelios's heart - ask him! I would thoroughly recommend a stay there for anybody who likes small personal hotels without crowds everywhere",1
Stayed here for a week and it was just so easy. The location is the biggest plus. Just off the main sea front away from traffic noise but so close to the beach. The room was very clean and comfortable. The family are lovely and really helpful. It is just a brilliant place to stay!,1
We recently returned from Santorini & stayed twice at Stelios's! We were so please see had chose this hotel. The family are lovely & very sweet. Getting picked up & dropped off at the airport by Stelios is fantastic & certainly took the stress out of arriving & departing for us. Rooms are always immaculate & cleaned everyday. We loved the pool area & always managed to get sunbeds. Location of this hotel couldn't be better for us - it was 1 and half minutes walk to the beach & the same the other direction to the Main Street with bus stop. Bakery's are amazing don't miss these! Booked our boat trip through the hotel & went to the Volcano & hot springs. Fab trip.We even used the hotels communal kitchen to make the kids some pasta on a few occasions (never saw anyone else using it) - another great asset to this hotel.Would definitely stay here again. Thankyou Stelios & family & Mylo for a great holiday - we love your hotel & will be recommending it to all our friends.,1
"This is a beautiful family run guest house hidden in a quiet spot in Perissa, yet only 1 min from the famous black beach and from the main road with bars/restaurants. The pool area is a lovely place to eat delicious Greek yoghurt for breakfast or relax for a while. A real oasis.We stayed in the quad family room which was fine for the 4 of us and has a lovely terrace. The rooms are immaculately clean and towels changed every day.Stelios and his family are very friendly and helpful, from picking you up at the airport to a welcome drink on arrival. Charming, individual and a perfect spot for relaxing and exploring Perissa.",0
"From the time we arrived to the time we left, nothing was too much trouble here.Stelios, Ava and Katarina were so friendly and welcoming. The rooms are spotless with maid service and fresh towels every day.Can't praise it enough and will certainly be back.Another big plus is the location. A two minute walk from the beach and lots of great restaurants and bars. Loved every minute of our stay.",0
"My wife and I stayed for 5 nights in the middle of May 2016. Having read the reviews for the Stelios Place before booking, we are please to say we weren't disappointed in the slightest! Katerina and her family were well looked after and nothing was too much trouble! The room was small but had everything we needed including a nice balcony with gorgeous views of the mountains. Perissa beach is a 30 second walk and the bus stop to Fira is less than a minute away. We had a wonderful stay and will be looking to return again in the future. Thank-you Katerina!",0
"We had very good time at Stelio's Place. HE picked us up at the port when we arrived in Santorini and gave good tips about the city. The room was very clean, air conditioning working perfectly and had a good swimming pool just in front. Lot's of bars and cafes in a few minutes walking and also very close to quadbike rantal.",0
"My friends and I just checked out today we spent spent 4 days and 3 nights there. I can honestly say the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and the hotel is in a great location . We did one of the excursions the hotel recommends which was a lot of fun . The hotel is steps away from the black sand beach and lots of places to eat . I recommend renting a scooter or four wheeler ,in the low seasons they are about 15 euro for the day but in the high seasons they are a little more but totally worth it because you can drive the whole island within one hour and a half .",1
"I was pleasantly surprised that the owner came at 1am to pick us up from the airport. The owner does it on his own accord. After learning that cab rides range from 40-45euros minimum around the island, the owner's gesture was greatly appreciated. The place was beautiful, and the location was absolutely ideal! 30second walk to the bus stop or the car rental store. 1 minute walk to the beach where you can take your pick on the range of excellent restaurants available.Need to arrange a tour? Just drop by the reception and the owners will arrange one for you. You'll even get a better deal!Could not recommend this place any higher. 10/10. Will DEFINITELY return.Louis and Shirley",1
"My sister and I just spent a week at Stelios place in Santorini and had the best week of our lives. Santorini was definitely a hike to get to, but as soon as we arrived here, we knew our long, exhausting trip would definitely be worth it. First off, the staff here is so friendly, welcoming and accommodating. Stelios is run by the sweetest family who are more than willing to help you book activities in Santorini, give you recommendations, and treat you as if you are family. They helped us coordinate a day of exploring the island on ATVS, showed us the best bakeries in the area, and were always there to help with a huge smile and friendly greeting. One day, I had a bad stomach ache, and the mother even offered to cook me some rice to soothe my stomach! Katerina is great at communication, and responds to your emails quickly, and helped us coordinate a ride to and from the port. (they provide free transportation to and from the airport/port!) SO convenient!The location of Stelios Place is to die for. 1 minute walk from the Black Sand Beach, and a 30 second walk to the local bus stop which can bring you to the 2 main towns of the island- Fira and Oia. We loved sitting on the lounge chairs on the beach in the morning which had restaurant service from Yazz- a cute restaurant on the beach front. Amazing menu with delicious smoothies, yogurt parfaits, cheese boards, salads etc. It is also a quick walk to delicious bakeries, a market where you can get a few groceries, and some cute restaurants. The best of both worlds- super close to beach relaxation, and easy access to town if you want to explore/ go out to eat. The lovely staff cleans your room, makes your bed, and provides fresh towels every day (also provide beach towels!) The property is extremely clean, quiet, and serene. There are fresh flowers and trees everywhere, a large, gorgeous pool, and plenty of lounge chairs to soak up the sun at the pool. We cannot say enough amazing things about Stelios place- my sister and I highly recommend to everyone- especially younger people traveling on a budget! Thank you for the best week! :)Carrie and Mia",2
"Just returned from a beautifully relaxing weekend at Stelios Place. What a little gem. Stelios and his family are so kind and welcoming and it was a pleasure to stay there from start to finish. Perfectly placed, just a stones throw from the Black Beach in Perissa, Stelios place makes an ideal base from which you can explore this beautiful island. If you just want a quiet day by the pool that is possible too. It is my pleasure to recommend Stelios place without reserve.",0
"Spent three nights here with some friends during spring break. The whole staff is fantastic and friendly, and Mr. Stelios picked our whole group up from the airport at 1AM from our flight free of charge. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable, and the price is great for the location- literally 100 yards from the beach! I would definitely return and would highly recommend Stelios!",0
"Just returned from a week stay here and loved the peaceful setting just a couple of minutes from the beach. Rooms were clean, modern, and had daily maid service. The owners, Katerina and family, were all very friendly and helpful during our stay. The bar was not open during our stay, but there was good choice of bars and restaurants along the beachfront. Mini-market and bakery also few minutes away. Easy to get to Fira from Perissa by bus, stop just outside hotel. Free airport transfers was a real bonus. Great value for money rooms, hope to stay again sometime soon!",1
"Great hospitality, friendly and accommodating. Picked up to and fro the airport, makes it convenient. Strategic location, near the beach, bus stop(easy to go around the island) , restaurants and bars. Place is clean and quiet too.",0
"Just stayed here and had a fantastic stay. Staff were great and very accommodating to any requests. Facilities were great and the central pool was amazing. We had beach and pool views from our balcony.Perissa was a beautiful place and the beach is only about 10 metres from the accommodation. Perissa and most of Santorini is very seasonal - we were lucky restaurants had just started to open a few days before we arrived (9th April). I wouldn't stay much earlier than this as there would be very little options to eat and go out. We visited Kamari one day and barely anything was open, we later found out most things don't open there until May.April is a nice time to visit though because the weather is good (we had 21 - 27 degrees and sun) and you don't have the crowds! Also note this place is the complete opposite side to Oia so depending on what you want from your stay this could effect some people. We loved Perissa and enjoyed visiting Oia for just the evening. Red beach was also a good visit and the village Pyrgos should not be missed!We also stayed with our 2 year old and staff were great with our daughter, she still talks about Milo the dog! Thanks for everything!",0
"Stelios Place is an absolutely amazing place for all people to stay. They picked us up from the port and dropped us off at the airport. The family was extremely caring, and made sure that we were a priority. Such a sweet and kind family. Definitely stay here! The location is right on the beach.",0
"We always promised ourselves to return to Santorini took us 13 yrs but was worth the wait when you find this little gem of a place to stay.We got picked up from the airport had a mini tour as we had to stop at port to pick another couple up.You are made to feel welcome from that moment you first engage the whole family such caring people nothing was too much.Rooms cleaned every day, fridge in your room as well , bathroom small & snug but who spends their day in there.We had a fantastic time here, beach, restaurants and scenery too die for",0
"Stelios place is absolutely perfect for families, couples and anyone else!! The whole family are so kind and welcoming. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning which was lovely. Our room was cleaned every day. The location was perfect, so close to the beach And all the lovely restaurants. Can't wait to return.",2
"We stayed here as a group of 6 girls travelling together. We had a fantastic stay. Stelios and his family were wonderful to deal with from when we first booked the hotel, responding very quickly to any requests and emailing us informing us of day trips they could arrange for us during our stay. Stelios picked us up from the port and was very friendly. The hotel is in a very good location, in a quiet spot off the main street and close to the bus stop. I would definitely recommend staying here - very good value for money!",0
"Great rooms, with balconies. You can hear quite well your neighbours, but that's the only inconvenient.The staff is super friendly and helpful! They have a free shuttle from and to the airport.The breakfast is not free, but really good. Like really good.Theres a pool and it's located 5 minutes from the beach by feet.They also organise excursions.Best hotel ever!!",2
"My wife and I spent the week of June 2-7, 2015 in Santorini at Stelios Place located just a couple of blocks from Black Beach in Perissa. We were impressed the moment we saw the place, and when we met owners Stelios, Eva and Katerina we knew we picked the right place to spend the week. They made us feel like we were guests in their home. Our room was comfortable, clean and spacious with a nice balcony with a table and chairs where we enjoyed our nightly night cap overlooking the pool. They did a nice breakfast and were always ready to help with a recommendation or direction and the complimentary pickup and drop off at the port were appreciated. Lots of restaurants in the area, as well as the beach, local shops, roads into the countryside for walking and the BIG grocery store is a 20 minute walk. We look forward to visiting again soon.   Room Tip: There isn't a bad one that we saw See more room tips",2
"The best thing about Stelios Place is its location in Perissa, relatively easy to get to each end of Santorini as Perissa is right smack in the middle of the island. We were surprised at how beautiful and well maintained Stelios Place is, despite it being a family business - a fun and friendly family, with a cute puppy. Very glad that Stelios was able to provide transfer services, which saved us a lot of hassle. Reasonably priced, simple, straightforward, no fuss room. It was only the air conditioner which became warm in the middle of one night which we had no idea what caused it to happen. We also had fun at the black beach which is only a 3 minutes walking distance and enjoyed the scenery of the huge volcano rock splitting Perissa Beach and Kamari Beach. Plenty of restaurants, bakeries and motor rents around the area. It was a shoulder season during our stay, and so we really loved the peace and tranquillity of the area.",0
"A great start to our vacation, I must say. Great location-very close to Perissa Beach, Bus Stop, ATV Stores, eating joints. Great Hospitality by the family. Small but clean rooms (had been better had a bottle of water and better toiletries been provided upon arrival though). Free pick-up and drop facility. Great value for money.Would also mention that this family is very caring as my friend had a sun burn. Not only did they help us with suggestions to soothe her skin but handed over the whole after-sun lotion bottle when we were checking out so that she did not have a problem during rest of our holiday. Thank you and much-appreciated!!!Would definitely recommend and visit again!!!",0
"I don't see how it would be possible to beat this. The family welcomes you warmly when you arrive. Room was spotless, lots of outlets which was definitely a plus. Round trip transport to the port or airport free of charge. 2 minutes from the beach and tons of restaurants and bars. Also two minutes from quad or car rental-the location really is perfect. Will definitely come back!!!",1
"This is a very welcoming family run business. We were picked up from the ferry port and brought to the notel/ guesthouse at no additional charge. You are gifted with a very appreciated fruit bowl and a bottle of local santorini wine on arrival at Stelios place, it 's a very thoughtful and welcoming gesture. The location is great, within minutes of Perissa beach, and the outdoor pool at Stelios, is very nice for a quick dip at days end. It's a very pretty setting.We had a very basic room at the back of the bigger buildings next to the kitchen. It was clean and comfortable and completely quiet. For the price we can't complain.I would not hesitate to recommend a stay here.",0
"This was a great place to stay in Santorini, as it doesnn't carry the same sky high prices as can be found elsewhere on the island, but everywhere on the island is easily accessible by bus. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms were excellent.",1
"This was our second visit to Stelios Place and we were so glad that not much had changed. We were collected again from the airport and welcomed by this warm friendly family as if we were friends.The hotel itself is spotless and kept in immaculate condition. Our room contained a welcome pack of fruit and wine and we had a lovely view over to the sea.Board is room only but breakfast is available every day. we preferred the yogurt and fruits, which kept us going until lunchtime each day. The family are so hospitable. On one day, Stelios brought us some fresh figs which were delicious - his father in law had dropped them off from his orchard and he shared them among the guests. Another day, we had cake offered to us. The pool is clean and great for a dip after a day out but the beach is only about 50m away on the main front which is where all the bars and restaurants are too. The wifi is free and good enough to FaceTime home.We were sorry to leave and no doubt will return before long!",0
"Great location in perish beach. Only 5mins walk to black beach and lots of restaurants/cafes. Quad and bike hire very close also. We were collected and dropped off at the port which was much appreciated. Stelio and his family were very helpful and welcoming. We were able to book day trips to the volcano with them, and they were happy to provide advise and information. The rooms were spacious with a balcony. Breakfast around the pool was lovely. We will definitely be back.",0
"I travelled to Stelios Place for one night at the end of September 2015. The hotel was in a good location, very close to the beach (about 2 mins walk away) and near bars and restaurants. I arranged a transfer from the airport directly with the hotel which was easy and efficient. The hotel owners made me feel very welcome. There is free wifi available. The strip of bars/restaurants along the beach are good and the beach has the typical black sand you would expect on Santorini. Stelios, his wife and daughter are all very welcoming and friendly. The breakfast was good too which I paid for on top of my room rate. I would love to stay again, but next time for longer. The room was basic, but very clean and comfortable. The hotel was quiet too and the outside pool was a good temperature. Thanks Stelios and the family!",0
"This is our second time at this wonderful family run hotel (first time for our daughters wedding). spotlessly clean. very close to all ammenities with the beach only 30 yards away! Very peaceful and relaxing with a lovely pool, where my wife finally learnt to swim. Many thanks to Stelios, Eva, Katerina and Voula. They are so friendly and helpful and will ensure that you have a fabulous time.",0
"Stelios Place is a perfect option in Perissa Beach... Very well located, perfect size rooms, extremely clean and a wonderful staff. Really recommend the place, probably the most warm and helpful staff you will meet!!! Definitely the best value for money!!!",1
"Thank you for a great stay yet again , loved the room and loved seeing all your family again !! It's a great hotel very close to the beach . There are many great places to eat , your never go hungry !! The bus stop it's yards away and very cheap to hire a car !! Such a fab place x",1
"Well another 2 week stay with Stelios, Eva, Katerina & Voula (& Mylo) and yet again its been a splendid stay. We love Stelios Place - everything could want from a small family hotel. Clean rooms, No critters, No hassle, Great service and Personal attention. Close to the Perissa beach front, transfers, wifi, a/c and room safe all in the price. Thank you again for a lovely stay and missing friends so much. xx Keep eating the cucumber xx",2
"Lovely, welcoming family running Stelios Place. Perfect hosts. Clean and tidy accommodation. Great pool and sun beds and only about 50m walk to the beach and neighbouring restaurants. Would recommend to anyone.",1
"Many thanks to Stelios and his family for a fantastic visit to Santorini. We were met by Stelios at the airport for the short transfer to Perissa. He is a really genuine friendly guy, greeting and chatting to us on the transfer from the minute we got there it was like being part of the family. On arrival, we were shown to our room which was very comfortable and clean and we were given a lovely gift of a bottle of wine and basket of fruit which we thought was lovely gesture. The family were always around for any help should we have needed it, we did ask for a kettle which was no problem at all, the family couldn't have been more helpful, we even got a plate of figs to eat from Stelios's own garden which were so sweet and delicious, a much appreciated snack whilst sitting around the pool enjoying the sunshine. I cannot think of anything negative to say as its that good so if you are looking for a fairly priced hotel in Perissa this is the place to go. We even got a transfer by Stelios to the port at 8 am on the day we left and I cant thank Stelios and his family enough for the kindness they showed and cant wait to return here on our next trip to Santorini.   Room Tip: Mountain view rooms See more room tips",1
"2nd time at Stelio's. Great family owned hotel 100 feet from the beach. Frapes are awesome to wake up to poolside. What's great about Stelio's besides the great rooms and service is the location. 100 feet to the left is the beach, 100 feet to the right is everything you would need from the shops. Travel agencies for your boat bookings, restaurants galore, smokes, moped/car rental, bakeries, laundry, beach gear, all of it right there. Perissa is quiet and truly a vacation spot. You can always scooter into Thira or Oia, but for true convenience and peace and quiet, Stelio's in Perissa Beach is the spot",0
"I stayed here for my birthday for 5 nights from the 3rd Sept to 9th Sept. After reading positive reviews about this hotel prior to booking, I decided to choose this one from what I had read on tripadvisor. when I had arrived, I got a free airport transfer there and back from Stelios, as long as you inform them in advance for stays of more than 2 days. the pictures on the website was as described in real life. rooms was nice and spacious, and everything was working, e.g the air con and tv and I also had a balcony in my room. When I arrived at the hotel, I did initially have some difficulty with shower as I didn't know how to operate it properly, but the lovely Katerina showed me how. I also had some difficulty setting up the hotel safe, so I went to reception and stelios showed me how to do it. Apart from that and just me being silly now knowing how to operate it lol, everything was fine and I had a fantastic stay. I would highly recommend here if you want nice, cheap accommodation that's very close to the beach and many places to eat. Since I stayed here during my birthday, I informed them in advance that this was one of the reasons why I came to Greece. I was out on a tour for the whole day, when I came back, it was so nice to find that Katerina and Stelios had placed a fruit bowl, along with a bottle of greek wine and slice of cake on the bed waiting on the bed for me. :) If you are reading this, may I say a big thank you to Katerina and stelios for their kind hospitality, service and kindness for making my 30th birthday and stay in santorini a special one and for welcoming me to the hotel. I will most definitely be coming back given the chance of revisiting santorini in the future. :) x",1
"What a lovely place to stay in Perissa. The whole family are so very lovely, caring and helpful and extremely welcoming. The accommodation is perfectly placed to access all that Perissa has to offer. The standard of cleanliness us exceptionally high. The beds are sooooo very comfortable with effective air con to make your room very comfortable. We had a lovely balcony that was private and a good size. The pool is small but great to cool off in. We were very appreciative of the transfers from Stelios both from the port when we arrived by seajet and the again to the airport when we were leaving. Nothing is too much trouble for this lovely family!",0
"My friend and I arrived at 6am and the owner was patiently waiting for us. Even though our room wasn't ready he allowed us to nap by the pool and locked up our bags. They gave us a welcome basket with fresh fruit and wine and were extremely helpful with suggestions of things to do and tips on how to use transit. The owner is more than happy to pick you up or drop you off at the airport or ferry. Considering this is a 3 star hotel they definitely receive 5 stars since it's clean and welcoming and close to the beach. Plus the pool is amazing and hospitality is top notch. My only thing that could be improved upon is the beds aren't super comfortable but not enough to effect a good nights sleep. I will definitely recommend this place to friends for the hospitality, location and good price.",0
"We spent two weeks in Stelios to enjoy Santorini in all its places to visit.The location is confortable clean and near the Perissa black beach.The people are very nice and friendly.very useful and funny the pick-up service from and to Santorini airport.We think to come back in the next years and our hotel will be Stelios!!!   Room Tip: choose the rooms behind the pool, you will have more quiet See more room tips",0
"Absolutely love this place perfect location, perfect staff and impeccable service. They should be the standard of what all other hotels try to achieve. It is only 1 min walk to the beach. My only regret is not staying longer!!",0
A family run hotel where the friendly touch is part of the holiday experienceNicely positioned in the heart of Perissa that allows you easy access to the beach and the local facilitesBut positioned allowing you the privacy from the cosmopolitan masses Just pricelss   Room Tip: air con availabe See more room tips,0
We stayed here in August and it was a great place to stay. From the moment Stelios collected us from the airport he was nothing but hospitable. The rooms are average on size but have all the necessary requirements including shower toilet tv beds fridge air con. The pool was very peaceful until we got there! Our children found it perfect size and depth and it was clean without being full of chemicals.The water was quite cold in the morning but the water warmed in the afternoon and as the pool area is a sun trap it is a nice dip in the water! The beach is a stones throw away and short walking distance to the restaurants and shops.Overall an excellent stay in nice family owned accommodation. I cannot thank Stelios and family enough for making us so welcome.Highly recommended!,0
"This is the perfect choice if you decide to stay at Perissa Beach. Stelios Place covers all bases; close to the beach, very reasonably priced, and run by a very friendly family who provide a lot of fantastic extras. Free transfers to and from the port or airport, a welcome basket with lovely wine, and towels for the pool or beach. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Most have a balcony with table and chairs. Breakfast is extra but very reasonably priced. It's a short walk to the beach and restaurants. We made a great choice staying here!",0
I just back from one week stay in this amazing family hotel.All about this hotel was amazing Amazing family - kiss for fantastic Eva Amazing location - 60 sec walk to beach Amazing room - room number 12 view for beach :) Amazing housekeepers - our room was perfectly cleaned every day fresh bed linen and fresh towels just superb !!! . Amazing atmosphere- very helpful family always happy to help. One again thank you to you guys for making my holiday even more special xDefinitely I will book this hotel on my next stay in Santorini,0
"we have just spent an amazing week at stelios place for our daughters wedding.the family are brilliant, so thoughtful and kind. the studios are spacious,clean and well kept.also is great that stelois picks you up from the airport. the beach is only 2mins away where there are numerous bars and restaurants of affordable prices",0
"Me and my boyfriend stayed for 2 nights at Stelios Place and it really felt like home. Mr Stelios picked us up at the airport, showed us the great views on the way to the hotel and suggested us places to visit and also to eat. Everyone was really friendy and adorable. They even gave me tea when they heard that I was a little bit sick! So nice! I wish we had more time to spend there! So if you plan to stay in Perissa, go to Stelios Place!",0
"We had a wonderful 3 night stay at Stelios Place and would stay again next time we come to Santorini. The hotel is in an excellent location about 100m away from the beach, which is very convenient for days at the beach, and very quiet at night. The area is very safe and has everything you need within walking distance (restaurants, bakery, laundry mat, bars, stores, car/moped rentals, bus stop, etc.). The service at Stelios Place was exceptional. Stelios, Eva, Katerina, and Voula were all friendly and helpful and really added to wonderful experience. We were picked up at the airport (included if you stay a minimum of 2 nights I believe). We were given all of the information to help us during our stay ie. bus schedules, restaurant recommendations in town, location of a bakery, etc. We also booked a boat cruise for 25 Euros a person through the hotel that was a wonderful experience and excellent value.The rooms were a nice size and very clean. One criticism would be that the bed way a bit noisy and wifi was a little slow at times. That being said, those were minor concerns that would not discourage us to recommend this place.",0
This hotel is in a perfect location just steps away from the beach as well as restaurants and the bus stop is near so you can go downtown to thira which was amazing. The owner offers free pick up and drop off which is so nice and helpful HE is such a nice man. Such a great family hotel I highly recommend staying at Stelios place IT was perfect and perissa beach was amazing.,1
"The hotel had a great location and was very clean. Unfortunately our room overlooked concrete wasteland, shower was very small and had no toiletries. Owners were very helpful, but did not allow card payment, which would have been good to know in advance.",0
"I was traveling with a friend and we spent 5 awesome days at Stelios Place. The owner organised a free transportation from and to the airport, which was really helpful. The location of Stelios Place is good for relaxation: lovely shops and restaurants and the beach is just around the corner. Also a bus stop was located nearby, so we could easily visit the bigger cities Thira and Oia for more action. The family running the place was really friendly and helpful - I felt that they would have done anything to take care of me. Our room was really clean and had a balcony with a fantastic view. Airconditioning worked like a dream, no problems with that. Breakfast and wifi were decent. The shower didn't have any pressure, but I still got my hair washed. :) Also the pool was really clean and nice, I actually preferred the pool to the beach.All in all I highly recommend staying at Stelios Place!",1
"Best hotel I've been in years! The owners are excepcionally willing to help you, the room are spotless and refurnished, and in spite of being in the middle of Perissa Beach you've got the impression of being in the middle of nowhere, as the windows are excellent too. There's air conditioning in the rooms and the pool is great. So is the breakfast. I'll be back for sure!",0
"We only stayed here for two nights after visiting three other places but it was the highlight of our trip. Katarina was very efficient during the booking process and emailed lots of useful information. We were picked up at the port by Stelios and taken to the hotel which on arrival surpassed our expectations, most small Greek hotels are quite basic but having been refurbed in 2010 this has modern fittings and is very comfortable. It's in a great location between the Main Street and the beach giving very easy access yet is quiet and peaceful. Most of all though it is just the friendly welcome you receive here, I suspect that if you stayed more than a few days you would become part of the family! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend",1
"Stelios family does everything to make your holiday in Santorini unforgetable! All stuff is very helpfull and always smiling. We felt part of their family, not just costumers! The rooms are so clean, and it's nice to see someone cleaning the pool area each morning and you can have your breakfast right next ti the pool. Try the yoghurt with fresh fruit, honey and musli! They also serve nice cocktails and fresh fruit juices during all day! Stelios place is the best place to be un santorini and we'll be back soon!!",0
"We were a group of 4 family members - 2 Adults and 2 children (15 and 9)First the place: This is the most convenient and cleanest and comfortable budget place we have ever been to. Proximity to the Beach, the Swimming pool were all bonuses. Stelio (owner) came to pick us up at the airport at wee hours of the morning and he had a smile on his face(note airport pickup is only if you stay at least 2 nights). That brings me to the next part i.e. People running the place. Eva, Katerina, Voula and Stelio go far and beyond to make you comfortable. Eva is the best of the lot ! she offered us cheese the first day (for the paid breakfast) and then next 2 days she remembered that I liked it so made it available without asking !! Same was with the cake she had baked and believe me it was amazing!!.. Katerina is the quiet one but the efficient one as well :) she had mailed me in advance about sightseeing tours and I had booked one of them thru her and when we arrived it was she was ready with all details and everything was well organised... Three cheers to the Stelios Family!... keep up the good work and we will spread the good word around!   Room Tip: All rooms are excellent. try to get a pool facing one. See more room tips",0
"Stelios Place is just amazing! Stelio, Eva, Katerina Voula are such lovely warm welcoming people. They make you feel like one of the family the minute you arrive and treat you as such until you leave. The place is completely spotless. The room was spacious and clean and it was lovely to crisp white towels that were changed on a daily basis. An added extra was beach towels in the room! How thoughtful.Katerina also gave us a welcome gift of fruit and wine, which was a lovely touch. Stelio is constantly on the go, back and forth to the airport, another personal touch. We had a hire car, but if you didn't you had no worries about transfers to the airport.The apartments are located literally a 2 minute walk from a very nice beach. The sand is dark, but nonetheless, beautiful. The resort of Perissa has everything you could want, including bars, restaurants and shops. The whole area is very clean.Katerina helped us book an excursion on a catamaran which was an amazing experience and would definitely recommend it. It sailed around the island's coast, stopping for swimming and snorkelling if you wanted to, then later a meal on board with champagne and sail back to watch the sunset. FABULOUS.Wifi is free and fast, even faster than at home!! The rooms have free air conditioning which is very effective.I would definitely stay here again if we were ever in Santorini again. Stelios Place is a hidden gem. Thank you so much for a fantastic stay and hope you have many more years of happiness there...... you deserve it. Anne, Alex & Beth xxx   Room Tip: We had room 2 which had two windows, lovely aspect See more room tips",0
"Stelios Place was by far the nicest place we stayed in Europe. The place was always clean, showers were cleaned daily and sheets were changed as well as towels. They even gave beach towels to use!! Beach is only a 2 minute walk, and the pool at the hotel is so beautiful we only went to the beach once! Staff was always friendly. Stelios picked us up at the Santorini airport even though we emailed last minute. His daughters were beyond helpful in giving us the best restaurants and activities to see in Santorini. They even planned a day trip for us to the volcano and hot springs. Can't say enough good things about this family and this place!! You can't beat it for it's price!!",0
"I stayed 3 nights in Perissa Beach at Stelios place. From the moment I arrived I was treated like a family member.I was shown to my room (2 hours before check in) which was very clean and had great air conditioning. A beach towel was also supplied which was useful given that the accommodation is just 50 metres from the black sand beach.I went for a walk and when I returned a small note accompanying some fruit, bread and a bottle of wine was waiting g for me. Such a kind gesture. The family also gave me plenty of advise on what to do in Santorini and where to hie quad bikes etc.When it came to leaving they asked me where I was going. They offer free transfer to port and to airport. I was off to vlichada though to meet a yacht tour and without hesitation they insisted on taking me so I didn't need to worry about taxi or buses. I was so grateful for this. Even when I tried to tip for the ride it was turned down.What a wonderful time I had at Stelios Place. The reviews on here are a true testament to the wonderful place.One day I will return. Thank you.",0
"A really great place to stay. Stelios and his family were very friendly and helpful from the word 'Go' and throughout our holiday. We stayed for two weeks, and as the days passed we felt more and more like a member of the family. Breakfasts were great, from full English to continental or just Tea and Toast, it was no trouble and there was always a smile. Our room (Room 6) was excellent, very clean and we were well looked after by the cleaning staff who also spent time with us. On the negative side, we did have a problem making room for a shower, but we got over that by using the bathroom as a 'Wet Room'. Perissa is also a wonderful place to be, plenty of bars and tavernas on the Beach Front. All of them exceptional quality. We enjoyed the Atlantis Bar the most in the day, we went there for our lunch and spent the days on the beach using their sunbeds. Very well kept, raked every day, and when we spent 20 Euro's in the restaurant we had the price of our sunbed refunded. (7 Euro a Day). The only negative side of the beach front was the cars, bikes and utility vehicles throughout the day. No noise but inconvenient when walking. The area is pedestrianized of an evening, nice place to stroll. Really pleasant place to stay, lively enough without being too busy. We returned from our holiday 'Chilled and Refreshed'. Thank You Stelios, Thank You Stelios's Family, Thank You Perissa, and Thank You Santorini, we shall definitely return. Mike and Joy",0
"This place in an unfound gem!!!We found Stellios Place on Trip advisor and from our first enquiry we were not disappointed. Katerina responded to our enquiry in a very prompt and informative manner when it was out of season, she even sent us a presentation on all of the trips that we could do whilst staying in Santorini.When we arrived Stellios picked us up from the airport and brought us promptly to the hotel showing us where the key places were in town if we should need them. We had a fantastic greeting from the rest of the family and we straight away felt at home.The rooms are extremely clean, with free WiFi, hair dryer and a TV in the rooms... they even supply you with beach towels which is a bonus if you fly with Easy Jet like we do! The breakfasts were great, just what you needed in the heat. Although we did go and do all the tourists bits we spent most of our time round the pool which is extremely clean and the sun beds are REALLY comfortable!You are 5 minutes from the beach and all the main restaurants and bars but it's far enough back that you don't hear any entertainment at night from your balcony.Highly recommend this place and we can't wait to go back and visit again soon.",2
Great hotel. Very friendly staff. We have been all over Greece in the last two weeks and this is the best place we have stayed. My bf is 6'4 and especially appreciates a shower that fits him. It's steps from the beach in one direction and in the other our favourite restaurant 'cyclades',0
"We were treated with fruit and wine. The hotel was very clean and you can tell Stelios, Anna, Katerina and Voula take pride in it. The wifi was excellent and the accommodations were exactly what one needs. We did not swim in the pool but hung out there. It is cool and deep. The hotel is off the main road but within walking distance to the beach, restaurants and the bus stop that will take you to Oia or Fira.The car service to and from hotel to catch air or boat was nice too. If you want to be away from the touristy areas, Stelios Place is for you.",0
Unfortunately i have one negative. That we weren't able to stay longer. .. We could only stay a night which was a shame. Not only because Santorini is amazing but the hotel is lovely. The staff here are unbeatable. They are warm and friendly and the place feels like a home away from home. The rooms are comfortable and have everything you need. There is a lovely pool and the locarion is very close to the beach and all shops and restaurants. The view from the rooms over the looming mountain is impessive even at night. If you want peaceful and relaxing i highly recommend this establishment. Would i come back here? YES,0
"Stelios Place was a little gem and as a Travel Agent I feel I have experienced many lovely places throughout the world. The accommodation was spotlessly clean, very well located and had everything you would need within a room. The family that own this hotel are lovely and cannot do enough for you. Breakfast is optional at the property which is paid for locally, we had it every day and was perfect for our needs. The pool area is small but lovely to end your day after maybe having been to the beach or travelling around all day and again beautifully kept. I have nothing negative to report about this property and would not hesitate to return.   Room Tip: pool view rooms See more room tips",2
"My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful week staying at Stelios Place. The free airport transfer was great, as our flight arrived in late on arrival and we were knackered - Stelios was very accommodating and waited for us until we arrived. Our room was gorgeous - the bed was comfortable, and we have a lovely balcony too. I'm surprised that some people have made comments about the shower - they must really have been looking for negatives as we found it worked fine. I'm also surprised that people have made negative comments about the pool in comparison to the pictures - if anything I think it looks better in reality than in the pictures!The location was spot on - Perissa is very nice and perfect if you don't want to stay slap bang in the middle of the heavily touristy areas such as Fira or Oia. The whole family were so lovely to us for the duration of our stay - we couldn't have asked for more in terms of service. And for the price - just amazing! Honestly, I couldn't recommend this place enough, we didn't see another hotel that we would have preferred to stay in for the whole week.",0
Sure enough we disembarked from out ferry at Thira port and Stelios was there waiting for us to drive us to his lovely villa at Perissa. The welcome from Katarina was wonderful along with the basket of fruit and wine. The room was sparkling clean and clean every day for our three night stay. The location whilst well away from the mad crowds at Ioa is probably a good thing. We hired a car for the day from a rental place a minutes walk from Stelios. There is also a laundry place close by run efficiently by a rather stern elderly Greek couple. Santorini is a magical place despite the boat loads of tourists and we made a good decision to stay at Perissa beach.,0
This was my second time visiting Rocabella but the first time as a family of three! We had an amazing time because we adults could relax and enjoy amazing cocktails by the pool and the kids were free to play around in the swimming pool! The rooms were stylish and the staff was very attending especially Alan!! Till next summer :),0
"This is an amazing property with a great location in Mykonos. Just 5-10 mins drive away from the hustle bustle of town overlooking the sea, Rocabella is one of the most romantic hotels on the island.I have been to so many countries but I have seen such a hospitality.Just pack your bags and come to this hotel,what to do,what to eat,where to go-Allan is there for everything.He is an amazing personality!! He is a manager cum guide cum friend!! Other staff including spa manager,restaurant manager and housekeeping manager everyone is so helpful and concerned that their guests don't face any kind of problem.Rooms are spacious with wonderful interiors and a beautiful view of the sea.Every evening there will a different fragrance of your choice in your room.You can choose your bed pillows too from a pillow menu. Everyday they put some yummy desserts in our fridge which were complimentary and it really came to us as surprise!! .They take care of such small things which matter a lot to the guests.Their pool is wonderful and so is the restaurant with a variety of dishes and a very tasty food.Dinner in their restaurant with such a romantic ambiance and stunning view of Mykonos in night is something that I can never forget!!If you are looking for everything, then this is the hotel to be in!! Perfect 10/10!!   Room Tip: Amazing Views,Great Host,Tasty Food,,Romantic See more room tips",0
"From the moment we were collected from the airport in the hotels private mini bus, we knew we were in for a long weekend of 5* treatment. Once at the hotel we were given a glass of cold champagne each and then Alan showed us a map of the island, helped us with restaurant reservations, we picked our room fragrances for nightly turn down services (amazing!) and then we were shown around the hotel before being taken to our rooms. We were travelling with 2 other couples who stayed in the panoramic suites. However we stayed in room 117 which we actually preferred to the suites. We still had a Jacuzzi on the decking but we felt we were much more secluded being right at the top of the hotel and we had a gorgeous view of the pool and sea below. The rooms are basic but modern, clean and beautifully decorated and we had a bottle of bubbly waiting for us on arrival too. Every night we would also be left some sort of food treat or drink which was a lovely touch. We spent most of our time around the hotel pool which is lovely and relaxing and all the staff are super friendly and helpful. The bar lady soon remembered our drinks orders and I became obsessed with Red Gimlets!! We also used the hotel restaurant for both lunch and dinner which we thoroughly enjoyed all our food was fresh and delicious. We also used the hotel spa a couple of times for massages which were dream like! Alan always helped organised our day trips (one day we went out on a boat for the day and sunset and another time we went to Solymar Beach) or reservations and transfers, nothing was too much trouble. It really felt like we were in paradise and it was a sad day when we had to leave. I could not fault this hotel or it's staff and luckily we have just booked to go back again next year so the countdown begins!!   Room Tip: 117 is right at the top, gorgeous view, very secluded with private Jacuzzi on balcony, amazing! See more room tips",0
"I usually don't write reviews online, but I had to make an exception!! This is an exquisite hotel with the warmest and friendliest staff, and breathtaking views. From the moment we arrived till the time we checked out, their service was excellent. It was my son's 8th birthday and upon arrival Alan and his staff arranged a surprised birthday cake for him, and a complimentary room upgrade, and I quote my son said, ""It was the best birthday ever"". In addition to that, the complimentary champagne and dessert upon arrival was top notch. They offered a one of a kind delicious breakfast buffet. Rocabella provided the perfect balance between a family friendly vacation and a peaceful atmosphere (that most parents dream of). I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have the best experience in Mykonos.   Room Tip: ""Family suite was spacious and comfortable"" See more room tips",0
"A warm welcome from all the staff at the Rocabella especially the wonderful, very stylish Allan! Allan gave us helpful information in regards to places to visit, car hire and restaurant recommendations. Every single member of the team were attentive, friendly and made us feel special and valued guests. We had a very comfortable room with a heavenly bed and luxury pillows! Lots of extras such as a scented candles at night and treats in the mini bar. The pool area was very relaxing had huge fluffy towels and again lots of staff visible for bar service requests. Breakfast was fantastic! So much choice and beautifully presented. Try the home made jams and my fav the banoffie pie yes for breakfast!! We were glad of the hourly free shuttle into town and transfers to other destinations could be arranged. The local beach is very pretty with clean fine sand and clear water. Reasonable and comfortable loungers were available. I was sad to leave this beautiful hotel and magical Mykonos. Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made our stay unforgettable.",0
"From the moment we arrived, we were promptly greeted by Alan and his staff. We were quickly checked in and the manager of the hotel gave us the grand tour of the hotel and its facilities and even walked us to our room. We were also given an outline of what to do in Mykonos and where to go. They made reservations for us and went the extra mile to ensure we were enjoying our stay. Customer service was EXCELLENT. The hotel itself was very clean and has a modern look and feel to it. We enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend Roca Bella! You won't regret it.   Room Tip: Balcony room is a must!!! See more room tips",0
"We spent only one night at Rocabella, but we had the chance to appreciate the hotel, the staff and the services provided. You really feel taken care of, since you first enter the place. As it was available that night, we were even upgraded to the top level room, including an open sea view and a terrace with jacuzzi. The place is very quiet, the staff attentive, the breakfast delicious with a huge selection. Even the restaurant is very good. I guess you couldn't ask more. Good work, Rocabella!",0
"We stayed here for nearly a week and it was a more perfect place to stay. The views were breathtaking, the service is amazing. Our room was small, clean and welle decorated. The facilities such as swimming pool, boutique shop, gym are always open. We will come soon for sure. Thank you.",0
"My husband and i had a great time in this hotel ! The service is perfect and personalised, the staff is nice and dedicated, standing is like in a 5 star hotels ( fresh water when are at the pool, fresh orange juice in the morning, good coffee expresso, surprise every night in the mini bar, they book everything for you, they drive you for free when and where you want in the city, and .... they is a pillow menu !!!!!). Very good value for money compare to what we have seen around and modern deco ! Do not hesitate.Special thanks to Alan, the great manager of the hotel !",0
"Easily in the top 5 luxury and romantic boutique hotels in the world - we have stayed in many places all around the world and Rocabella Mykonos deserves its no 1 hotel in area and overall 5 star rating on tripadvisor and exceptional rating on booking.com. We only wish it was possible to give 6 star on tripadvisor.Welcomed by overflowing champagne and given a detailed description of must do's on the island was a great way to start. We were then ushered into our panoramic suite with plunge pool complete with a bottle of complimentary sparkling wine, special sweet surprise, orange aromatherapy wafting in the room and choice of natural pillows designed to ensure a wonderful sleep. However what really makes the experience is the the staff - we arrived as guests and left as friends. Allan, Margarita, Ronnie, Anna, Mina, Giannis and the entire staff were all focused around helping all guests with a fabulous vacation, including providing a surprise birthday cake as one of us was celebrating our birthday while on vacation. We stayed 10 days and booked our room directly with hotel in February so got a great deal and advance discount. Recommend this to all the guests who can plan in advanceBreakfast/Brunch has to be one of the best on the island - something for every taste and preference, finishing at 11am and with choice of any coffee, fresh juice and champagne mimosas if desired. The free shuttle to Mykonos town was a great value extra as location is just out of Mykonos town and easily accessible by shuttle - we choose this as best of both worlds since we wanted the serenity while also being close to the action. We also used the shuttle at least half the time to explore the other beaches (e.g. Lia, Kalo Livadi, Fokos, Agios Sostis Jackie O at Super Paradise) and restaurants recommended by the team. The shuttle was very convenient and cost effective way to get around the island. Thanks again to Allan and all the team again for an amazing vacation - we are already planning our next visit.   Room Tip: Panoramic Suite with privacy plunge pool is well worth the additional cost and book early direct wit... See more room tips",0
"Offered one of the best hospitality and staff service I have experienced abroad. A very nice , private hotel - with great views and a lovely pool. The staff will cater to you throughout the day. Slightly on the pricey end to stay in which is why haven't given all stars but the island accommodation is generally expensive!Definitely worth booking - especially as a couple or a quiet weekend away with friends.",0
I just love the hotel's laid back atmosphere. Being a returning guest I had a surprise waiting in my room!just lovely!This time I travelled with a friend and her baby and we had the best holidays ever!The hotel is spotless clean and the rooms are spacious with great amenities.We loved the connecting room with the outdoor jacuzzi.Alan and his team are doing great job keeping the guests happy!We will be back!,0
"We had an amazing experience at Rocabella. The staff was really fantastic - Anna, Margarita and Alan all took great care of us during our trip. They helped me set up a really beautiful proposal as well.Hotel is a boutique with great views. It's a bit far from the nightlife in the area but perfect for relaxing end of day. It's also quite close to town with a free shuttle back and forth.The breakfast was amazing as well. Best one we had on our trip to Greece.There's only 31 cabs on the island so you'll need to arrange transport ahead of time, but the staff will help make any arrangements and reservations you need.",0
"We first visited here last year as a group of friends. We are not usually in the habit of making return visits to hotels, but made an exception in this instance as perfection can not be bettered!Once again, Alan and his team ensured excellent service that made us feel like returning friends, rather then guests.Everything about Rockabella feels like a luxurious, holiday indulgence- exactly what holidays are all about.The hotel is a perfect location, with convenient shuttles into town and only walking distance from a pleasant beach. With a beautiful and quiet pool area with plenty of loungers and cabanas, you are spoilt for sunbathing spots. We indulged a bit further this year in having a suite with private terrace and jacuzzi- ultimate luxury.The breakfast options are wonderful, ensuring you have enough variety to try something different each day. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the service is exemplary.This hotel is ideal for couples and smaller groups. The spa treatments were also a joy.I am already thinking of my next trip back. Don't look any further. Book while you can!Thanks again, Alan. Hope to see you soonJo",0
"I forgot to review back in June... My wife and I loved this hotel, the best service in the world, Alan and the team are amazing, nothing is too much and they are always there to help or just catch up and advise you where to go etc... The hotel and room were lovely, restaurant amazing (as well as breakfast). We were sad to leave and will definitely look to stop there again whilst Greek island hopping.",0
"We have been to different hotels in Mykonos during our visit. Rocabella has most, nice big pool with lots of space, nice rooms, nice restaurant and then they have Alan. When you arrive you get bubbles, nice treatment and Alan. We had fantastic stay with best sauna massage and Alan. He gives you all the ins and out of Mykonos and Alan. Here they do not screw you up on transportation, talk to Alan   Room Tip: Give Alan a call in advance See more room tips",0
"This wonderful hotel has to be experienced to be believed- tastefully furnished, comfortable rooms, great food, superb views but what sets it out is the AMAZING staff- not just helpful but super friendly and welcoming- really outstanding- we loved it here.",0
"Ok, so I don't do this very often, but in this case I just had to take the time out to write a glowing review on Rocabella Mykonos. I travel extensively and very few places ever live up to their hype. I can tell you this is the exception. Everything you will read on their website or on TripAdvisor is absolutely spot on. I arrived expecting things to be a little different but was astounded by the hotel and staff. Alan and his team are most welcoming, willing to go the extra mile and happy to do so. The island is amazing, the hotel is one of the most picturesque we have ever stayed in, the food is great (especially the variety available for breakfast), combined with a great vibe and staff made this an unforgettable experience. Thanks Alan and staff. We will be back!Andy & Ann",1
"My boyfriend and I didn't want to leave this place ! The whole trip was amazing from start to finish! On arrival Marguerita sat down with us and told us the best place to visit on the Island and showed us around the beautiful hotel. She's a fantastic member of staff and always has time for her guests. All of the staff can't do enough for you and it feels like they are genuinely happy to work there, Ilias very kindly even emailed us after we left and said he was disappointed he was unable to say goodbye when we left. On arrival we had a free bottle of champagne, another free bottle of champagne for our anniversary (aswell as creating a beautiful set up in our room with rose petals and a free homemade cake!) aswell as numerous free nightcap's before we headed back up to the room on a night (courtesy of Ilias). In the hotel room they leave you little treats in your fridge and lite scent burners so your room smells amazing when you return from the town. The shuttle bus is also a great feature of the hotel as it's difficult to find taxi's on the island. The driver Ronnie is also lovely (and on time!). Overall the hotel is such a success because of the hard work and dedication all of the staff put into making your holiday a memorable one, from organising a quad bike and making dinner reservations this was all done for us without hesitation. Thank You to everyone at rocabella for an unforgettable stay! Jordan & Ben.",1
"Stayed here for a week in mid May and I can not think of a more perfect place to stay.Every single thing from the service to the decor was magnificent. Excellent views, perfect location with regular shuttle service. Breakfast choice was amazing. Would certainly tell anyone visiting Mykonos that Rocabella is the ONLY place to stay. Well done to Alan and his staff.. Long may they keep the standard up.   Room Tip: All rooms are excellent with very comfortable beds and good sea views See more room tips",1
"I'm normally far too lazy to write reviews of places I stay but the exceptional quality of the service at Rocabella demands recognition, if only so that others might have as effortless and enjoyable stay as we had. We arrived after a week's sailing in heavy winds and given the reviews and my slightly spoilt nature I decided to test the service. The response was truly over and above my (high) expectations. We were collected from our boat no problem, truly exceptional welcome, whole stay in Mykonos sorted our for us (reservations, guest lists, vehicle hire etc), every request met with charm and efficency. It's such a cliche but at every stage everyone went the extra mile - we would keep on finding little extras designed to make us feel just that little bit special and that demonstrated that those running the hotel really wanted us (and I assume every guest) to love our time there. Special mention has to go to the operations manager Alan who appears to be everywhere all of the time and perfectly combines the roles of manager, maitre'd, concierge, fixer and friend. He is an asset to the hotel but his attitude of doing everything he can to maximise comfort and minimise effort is reflected throughout. The fact that he chose to upgrade us to the best room as (a) we'd had a heavy week and, I suspect, (b) the room was free obviously helped somewhat... It's just that sort of thinking that makes a place special.So, a 5 star boutique experience from end to end. If you prefer more nuanced, thoughtful, bespoke boutique with ultimate focus on personalised service to grandiose larger scale glamour, I could not recommend Rocabella highly enough.",1
"This was our second visit to Rocabella and if it was possible the stay, the staff and the hotel were even better than before. The staff friendliness, attention to details & helpfulness is beyond that we have experienced in far more expensive and vaunted hotels around the world. This hotel is a team effort run effortlessly by Alan and Kostas being expertly assisted by Margarita, Anna and Vicky. They also have the #1 driver in Mykonos in Roni ( according to Elsa ) !!Its not a case of would we go back ?? but rather how can we get enough money to stay longer. Both kids are currently on E Bay please bid generously !!",0
"This place is nothing short of exceptional - exceptionally run with exceptional staff who make your stay a real pleasure with their charm, friendliness and knowledge of the island. Special mention should go to the operations manager, Alan, who is a real asset to this hotel. The facilities are top notch; the list of things that were above my expectations would be too long and a list of disappointments/improvements would be marked by its emptiness. Atypical of hotel restaurants, even the food here was super tasty. I won't be needing tripadvisor for finding my hotel stay next time in Mykonos as I will be staying here again.",0
"No wonder why this hotel is no 1 on trip advisor for mykonos : the place is beautiful, the rooms are small but clean and well decorated and above all there are many small details which make the difference : 1st the staff who takes the time to explain all what you can do in the island and recommends you where to go depending on your profile, and always with a smile. Second the little attentions like small complimentary snacks or drinks, the room fragrance which changes every night, the possibility to choose various pillows etc... Last but not least we enjoyed the hotel facilities like the gym which is just amazing. Big congrats guys, of course it's expensive but it's mykonos and when it's well done and can afford it then you really enjoy it !",0
"From the check in process you will realize how Rocabella is an amazing hotel. (Thanks to Alan)The staff friendliness, attention to details & helpfulness is beyond imagination.The nice cozy mykonian design of the hotel.The amazing facilities gym, swimming pool, boutique shop which is open 24 hrs ( YES 24 HOURS) and the great view of Aegean Sea.The amazing spa treatment (Thanks to Alici)The small touches like choosing your below preference, room scents and beach bag.Providing shuttle service to Mykonos town and mountain bike for usage both free of charge.For all these reasons Rocabella hotel is by far the best boutique hotel in Mykonos.",0
"I was unsure what to expect when i booked this hotel - will it live up to the hype & the amount paid?In a nutshell - yes it does.I had booked my ferry tickets to Mykonos very last minute & forgot to book a pick up from the port with the hotel.Long story short i had 30 minutes til i arrived & only just managed to gain wifi signal on the ferry. So i quickly messaged the hotel in a bit of a panicked state via their facebook page & thankfully they responded within 5 minutes & organised the driver who was waiting for me at the Port when i arrived.This is just one example of the exceptional 5 star service they provide.Alan is a real asset at Rocabella. He is trendy, friendly, professional & knowledgable. He is in my opinion a fantastic representative of the hotel brand. Alan welcomed me when i first arrived at the hotel & provided me a great overview of mykonos & the hotel.The reccommendations he provided for restaurants and bars were fab....thank you Alan!The hotel shuttle service is very reliable & comfortable. It also proves invaluable once you see how difficult it is for other tourists in Mykonos town trying to wait for one of the only 30 taxis on the island at 11pm at night. There is a beautiful beach, Agios Stefanos, only 2 minutes walk from the hotel which you must visit during your stay - you can rent a sun lounge under the tiki umbrellas for 5 euros for the day. Lastly, i highly reccommend the hotel spa services. I had a massage and it was fabulous. So book in for a facial or massage if you get the chance.To the team at Rocabella- Thank you for making my first trip to Mykonos a memorable stay",0
"We had amazing time in hotel. Perfect service, hospitality and beautiful place. Best breakfast what we ever had. We had lunch and dinner in Reeza restaurant several times and it was very delicious modern greek cuisine. Our 1 year old daughter felt very happy and everybody was very kind to her. We will come back soon for sure. Thank you Rocabella Mykonos <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>",0
"The hotel is amazing with an amazing view and the staff is the most kindest that I met. We are waiting for the next year to return :)Gorgeously decorated in whites, the hotel is a designers dream.Congratulations!!!",0
This has to have been one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. We started off by showing up hours after the lobby was closed and even though we arrived really late they stayed open and were still there waiting making sure we got settled and everything. This was quickly followed by an upgrade to a suite along with a very positive upbeat attitude by the hotel staff. I can not say enough about how helpful and out of their they went to make arrangements for everything including a tattoo in the off-season. I could go on for pages about how amazing the staff was. Thank you guys so much for making it a life changing experience and the best vacation I've ever had and look forward to going back!,0
This place just gets better all the time. We loved every second of our stay. We came back to Rocabella for our 5th visit and we dont want to go back to our real home :). The staff are very friendly and service-mlnded. The breakfast was AS allways the best you can get and the lunch/dinner restaurant Reeza is VERY good (see separate review).We met Kostas and Alan for the first time and they are awesome. If there is anything you need to know or need advice they fix everthing ! You guys lift the hotel to a higher level. We had friends visiting frim Tinos this time and the loved it too. The stayed at Rocabella for only one night but they didnt want to leave... Especially the kids thought they were in heaven...The spa is also great. If you say you need a STRONG massage you must mean it ! Aliki looks petit but she is strong. I also had a pedicure at the beginning of our stay - she made my feet very happy and pretty :)Thanks for everything. We will be back....,0
"The food,service,location,rooms and overall experience is the best! Great hotel I fully recommend it! Everyone that works there is super nice and kind. You won't regret coming here! The hotel is a short 5 minutes to town. Their driving service is great and will drop you off anywhere that you pre-arrange with them. The food is super good and fresh. The pool is nice and clean and the rooms are absolutely amazing.",0
"Myself and my husband stayed here for the first two nights of our Greek island hopping adventure. We were given a lovely warm welcome as very informative chat about the island and the best places to visit. Our room was beautiful with a stunning view and very sweet welcome gift. Alan was fantastic and is a great asset to the hotel, he chatted to us a few times during our stay and made it clear that he was at hand to help with anything we needed. We loved our stay and just wish it could have been for longer!!! Hopefully we'll be back sometime :)",0
"Quite possibly the best hotel of my life. I chose this hotel off the MR & Mrs Smith website, as they never disappoint. What a great decision! I have nothing negative to say, the hotel exceeded every single expectation.Super friendly staff, great spa, delicious breakfasts, amazing view and superb location - this hotel has it all.Located close to Agios Stefanos beach, each room has a beautiful view of Mykonos and the sea. The hotel arranged an airport pickup for me as well as a drop off after the holiday. They also provide a daily shuttle to Mykonos from the hotel and back, which was a great service. Roni (the driver) knows everything there is to know about Mykonos, make sure to get his tips!Gorgeously decorated in whites, the hotel is a designers dream. I tool almost 1,000 photos.Rooms are quiet, air conditioning is available in all. Lovely soft bathrobes and plenty of toiletries are provided. A special treat is left for guests every night in the mini bar. Rocabella - you were amazing! I will definitely be back.",0
"From the facilities, the staff, the room (108), view and food, this hotel was absolute perfection. Alan, the operational manager is one of the best assets of the hotel who made our stay even more enjoyable by suggesting activities and places of interest. He and his team were so helpful and friendly, everyone from the receptionist to the masseuse! The hotel enjoys breathe taking views which can be enjoyed from the wonderful and spacious pool area, or from the incredible room views. The hotel is definitely a place for couples of families looking to chill out and enjoy some rest. A must go to – I could not recommend this place more.   Room Tip: rooms with the private small pool allow for some more privacy for couples wishing to enjoy some alon... See more room tips",0
"Boutique hotel is perfect. The location is excellent and very central, the rooms and especially the beds are really up to standard and comfortable. The food was very good too. besides breakfast being absolutely delicious the setting of the restaurant is perfect with wonderful sea views. The staff are very helpful and quaint in their own way and add character to the hotel. The Spa is excellent too and very affordable. But the crowning assist of this property is Alan Kodzasov, Operation Manager and within minutes a personal friend. He takes such a genuine interest in your holiday and really recommends the right places.",0
"Family with two teenagers, we stayed two days in the hotel.Absolutely loved it.Alan and his staff put all the efforts to make our stay there as agreeable as possible.Great facility, rooms, swimming-pool...Absolutely loved it and would like to come back.Thank youSimona&family",0
"The hotel was amazing with extremely friendly staff. The staff helped us plan each day by recommending places to visit, booking restaurants, beaches and even providing transfers from the hotel to each location we visited. The amenities at the hotel were great and we took advantage of all of them. The spa treatments were very relaxing and the food was delicious.",0
Right from the airport transfer we were treated amazingly and all staff were very professional and welcoming. The hotel was immaculate and the pool area is perfect with amazing views. Our room was a generous size and was very luxurious. The breakfast had everything you could want and all the food was of a very high standard.The free shuttle bus into the town every hour was great and very reliable and the hotel was also able to arrange additional transport should you need it. The manager Alan was fantastic and very knowledgable about the area and restaurants. We felt more like friends than just customers. This is a hotel like no where we have stayed before and the staff aim to provide a great personal experience which they are succeeding to do.We look forward to staying again :-),0
"All staff members made the experience at Mykonos 5*, they helped me and my friend to feel at home and were exceedingly helpful in recommendations of places to go, especially Hlias and Ronnie. The waiters were also kind and prompt and complimented the luxury style of the hotel, especially Giannis.   Room Tip: amazing view, friendly and young staff See more room tips",0
"We visited in Mykonos Island for a few days and had the chance to stay at the Rocabella. Everything was perfect since our arrival to our departure: - The room was spacious and peaceful - The view on the sea from our balcony was unbelievable- The breakfast was delicious. We had a large choice between the sweet and the savoury, with fresh orange juice.- Alan’s team was also extremely helpful all along. They gave us advice on what to see, where to eat, and most important, where are the best beaches on the island to hang out.If you want to be sure to have the best stay ever, we highly recommend you the Rocabella ! It is simply heaven on earth!",0
"We have been to Mykonos 8 times and can say this was probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in so far. Location, service, attentiveness, simple chic design, attention to detail made a difference. Hotel Manager Alan made us feel we are special and greated us with a great warm smile whenever we met him. Definetely recommended.",0
"We stayed one week in the hotel and had a great vacation. For sure there are some small things that are not excellent but that is normal. What really made the hotel distinct from the many luxury hotels we have been to is the hotel manager!! He made our vacation with recommending the best restaurants and places to visit, with organising tables and providing great advice. The hotel is small with only 21 rooms but those rooms are very nice (maybe the hifi has to be upgraded). The pool area is nice and spacious, the breakfast also good. As most parts of Mykonos you will have wind, which we enjoyed and which made the hot weather less hot :-)The hotel has parking and is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, so a great place for relaxing. On the other hand Mykonos town is close by and the hotel offers a regular shuttle. We will definitely come back!",0
"Everything at that hotel was amazing! The staff, the food, the service, the spa, the pool, the free transfer to the town - you guys there made us feel special and we couldn't have had a better vacation! If i should give this hotel a rate from 1 to 5 stars, i would give 6!   Room Tip: Stay in a room with privat jacuzzi on the balkony and with a sea-view - worth it! See more room tips",0
"My boyfriend and I spent a week at this stunning boutique hotel. We cannot fault the attentive staff, idyllic views and gorgeous accommodation. It was an amazing location and quintessentially Greek in it's presentation but with a contemporary edge. Highly recommended!",0
"Having stayed at the Rocabella 2 years ago, my husband and I had no reservations in returning to this beautiful boutique hotel for our honeymoon.We were picked up by the lovely driver and taken to the hotel. Advised of some changes in the hotel we were hoping that it was still the gorgeous place we fell in love with 2 years before and luckily it was- if anything it was better!The staff at the Rocabella are really what make the experience unique and warm. The hotel itself is beautiful- the interior styling and rooms are luxe beach style- very Mykonos chic, cool and modern without being too clinical and the attention to the finer detail makes it so unique. The pool and bar area are amazing- we spent a few days just floating on large cushions in the water! I normally don't love hanging at the hotel on holidays but you almost don't want to leave the RocabellaThe breakfast is incredible (we couldn't resist the spanikopita, hence a few gym sessions!) and the food at the hotel for lunch and dinner is definitely worth trying- lunch by the pool is a must!The spa is great- my partner had what he called the best massage of his life.All of these things are the makings of a truly excellent stay, but the staff have made this place what it is today. Alan, the hotel manager makes a point of not only knowing the guests names, but is genuinely invested in your trip and goes above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible time in Mykonos. All of the recommendations for beaches, bars and restaurants that came from Alan and the staff during our stay were some of our favorites!The girls at reception are always so lovely, friendly and helpful- particularly Anna and Margarita who helped us with a great restaurant for our last night!We are already planning our next trip back to the Rocabella- we have both travelled and never quite found somewhere that combines a cool, modern, luxe vibe with super friendly and lovely staff who are both professional and fun. Each person here really cares about your trip and experience, something I have never really encountered to this level.Well done to all the positive changes at the Rocabella- we will be back!",1
"We just recently came back from our honeymoon in Greece and just could not wait to write a review for Rocabella Mykonos! After flying for about 30 hours, my wife and I were exhausted and were just ready to relax and catch up on some rest. We were picked up swiftly by the hotel shuttle and upon our arrival, were greeted by Alan and his staff. This was the first stop of our honeymoon and we were just blown away by the service at Rocabella. From the choices in pillows (yes they give you 4 options!), to the choice of what essential oils we would like burnt in our room each night for turn-down service and to the little desserts we got in our room each night, all the little touches were just perfect. To top things off, Alan was super helpful in helping us plan our daily activities. We were so busy with planning the wedding that we didn't have much time to research what to do in Mykonos prior to arriving. Alan sat down with us and provided us with extensive recommendations and we were able to book things on the spot with the front desk (ie. rental car, massages, restaurant reservations). We were greeted with a smile everyday and Alan made sure to come say hi whenever he saw us. In addition to the amazing service, the hotel itself is located in a beautiful location away from the hustle and bustle of town. We were able to thoroughly relax! The hotel conveniently provides a shuttle to Mykonos town every hour and it was great that we got to meet other guests on our shared rides together. We were most impressed by the service at Rocabella and would not hesitate to return again. Thanks again for such a great stay!!",0
"What else can we add to comments already made. Just returned from a wonderful relaxing week - the location, rooms, breakfast and service were perfect for us. Lovely place made by the natural warmth of all the staff who work with smiles on their faces - Alan does a wonderful job - his staff are a credit to him..Had a couple of trips into Mykonos Town using the shuttle - which is lovely and quaint and easy to get lost on the narrow alleyways. Took a boat trip over to Delos - well worth it for the boat trip alone cruising past other islands.",1
"If you have decided to visit Mykonos, it is a great decision. It has something for everyone. If you choose to stay at Rocabella you will have made the best decision of your life! Rocabella's simplicity creates a tasteful, beautiful surrounding and atmosphere. Cleanliness cannot be faulted. As well as bed made and room cleaned each morning, every evening your room has a ""turn down"" and with it comes a delightful little treat. We chose a Superior Room with Seaview which whilst slightly smaller than we are used was absolutely perfect with everything you could need. The bathroom is very spacious with great large shower. Our bed was more than comfortable and you get a choice of 5 different pillows to sleep on! Food is amazing and our compliments to the chef for his menu at the hotel's new restaurant - Reeza. Try the steak - delicious! There is a beach nearby with 3 or 4 tavernas although we only went a couple of times as we preferred the pool (where occasionally more little treats were given!). There is a regular free shuttle to and from the town. I could go on forever BUT what I want to say more importantly is that the staff are wonderful. Alan and his fantastic team made us feel so welcome from the start. They will tell you all about the island when you arrive and give great recommendations for restaurants and beaches and throughout your stay they take the time to stop and chat, especially Alan, Mina and Amerisa - lovely people. As I write, Alan has just bought floating beds for the pool - they are amazing and when you try them ... because you will after all the reviews .. remember I was there first!! I will keep Rocabella in my heart until one day I return!",1
"I can only describe this place as magical. There are a thousand good things I can say about my stay in Rocabella. To begin I have never experience such an amazing service and attention in all of my life. The people who serve you at breakfast are the nicest persons I have encounter in any hotel experience and I have been to a lot of places and not even the most expensive hotels in New York or Madrid come as close as this beautiful Oasis staff. Let me tell you one thing, If you have the chance to Visit Mykonos believe me coming here is completely worth it. The management is also one of the best, the hotel is in a great location only 5 minutes away from town and rides can be schedule to any beach at your convenience for great prices. I believe Mykonos is a magical place on its own, but so it's Rocabella.   Room Tip: My room was a two bedroom with a private Jacuzzi, I would personally recommend it! See more room tips",0
I have stayed at many hotels all over the world but I must say that I have never felt such a warm and sincere welcome as that offered by Alan and his wonderful team. Everything was absolutely perfect from the amazing view that we woke up to every morning to the sumptuous breakfast. The hotel is beautiful and the Island of Mykonos is stunning however one of my enduring memories will the amazing staff at the Rocabella! We can't wait to see you all again next year.Carol & Terry.,0
Once we knew we were coming to Mykonos for our honeymoon we contacted Rocabella right away - we didn't even think of looking anywhere else. This was our second time coming to Rocabella (it definitely won't be the last) and our second visit was just as amazing as the first. Rocabella feels like home. The staff is amazing and is always there to help. The pool is beautiful and extremely relaxing. The breakfast is by far the best I've ever had while at a hotel and look forward to it every morning. The rooms are so clean and chic and I love the bath products which smell amazing. The service you get here is incredible. I can only say good things about Rocabella and can't wait for my next trip back!,0
A very attentive and dedicated staff! The view is absolutely breathtaking and the rooms couldn't be more beautiful. And we don't need to talk about the food which was delicious! The receptionists were very helpful and made our holiday unforgettable. Definitely a place to recommend.,0
"This was our 2nd visit to the beautiful island of Mykonos. This time we returned with a small group of friends.When we arrived at the airport our transfer was waiting for us. On arrival at the hotel Alan and his team were there to welcome us with chilled glass of champagne. They gave us a full introduction to the island and a tour of their fabulous hotel.Every single member of staff we had the pleasure of meeting was attentive, helpful & extremely polite. Nothing was too much trouble. They took the time to get to know us. It's very true that you arrive as guests and leave as friends! Our rooms were light, airy well equipped and spotlessly clean with spectacular views.Breakfast was divine.We are already planning our return next year!Thank you for a wonderful holiday!",0
"Amazing place. Not at all pretentious. Friendly, great aesthetics, the best hospitality, you feel like home from the first moment. The best breakfast, great great restaurant! You don't want to leave!! Leave me here forever!",0
"The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is clean, modern and very picturesque. The location is perfect - just out of the Town which is easily accessible as the Hotel provides a frequent free shuttle service. A memorable holiday thanks to Rocabella Mykonos.",1
"Nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff at this hotel. It is located outside of Mykonos Chora which is a positive as it can get really busy in town when the large cruise ships arrive. There is a free service into town which is a few minutes drive if you want nightlife, shopping etc. But we chose to relax completely on site and this was just lovely. There is a great breakfast - fabulous mix of local foods, and separate lunch and dinner menus. Cocktails were perfect, served by knowledgable and very friendly Greek staff. We also tried the spa which was very private and using Greek beauty brands that I hadn't tried before but was also of a very high standard.",1
"We had 6 nights a Rocabella and loved every minute of it. The staff (especially Alan) are so helpful and give great recommendations on places to see and dine.The rooms are really nice and the view was perfect. We loved the turn down service and the servicing of the room was always done while we where at breakfast, regardless of what time we had breakfast. We loved this place.",0
"Rocabella Mykonos is the gold standard for Greek hospitality. My wife spent 3 wonderful nights in Mykonos at the start of a 2 week long Greek island hopping trip. We were pampered from moment we arrived -- Alan sat us down, poured us several glasses of Rhodesian sparking wine, and gave us a wonderful overview of the island, the best restaurants and bars, and all that the hotel had to offer. The ""extras"" that Rocabella offers -- the personalized introduction to Mykonos, the Coco-mat bedding, pillow menu, the spa/massage treatments, aromatherapy and evening ""surprises"" as well as the hourly shuttle into town -- set this hotel apart from all others. Although we didn't enjoy the pool (it was a bit cold for that in April), we did enjoy the amazing views from it and from our personal balcony. It's no wonder this place is consistently voted one of the top romantic hotels in the world. We had very low expectations for Mykonos before our arrival. Frankly, we only went because we wanted to go to Delos for the day. But, thanks to Alan and the Rocabella's hospitality and guidance, we ate amazing food, saw amazing sites, and enjoyed ourselves immensely -- even off season!Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. We'll be back.",0
"Roccabella is the crown on an already fantastic island!It is that place you are looking for that is just a little bit more special than the others. Mindblowing by its location, service and most importantly the warm and generous team of genuine people making you feel at home away from home.I suggest you book over their homepage and who knows you might be in for a surprise. Excellent performance, thank you Alan & team!",0
"Me and my husband visited Rocabella resort from 10th June to 13th June for three nights. We stayed at deluxe sea room for one night and two nights at deluxe sea room with outdoor private spa which the hotel manager Alan upgraded our room to panoramic suite with outdoor plunge pool for our honey moon. This is a very clean and high customer service resorts I have been stayed so far, most of reception staffs are very very helpful, especially the manager Alan, he gave us very helpful and useful information about the island when we first arrived, all restaurants and beach he recommend to us are very good. We will strongly recommend our friends and everyone to stay in Rocabella Mykonos!!",1
We love Rocabella and had a very great time in Mykonos! Amazing staffs and facilities! And thank you Alan! Prob the best hotel in the please! Must go! :) Professional hospitality! Definitely would be back!   Room Tip: professional hospitality See more room tips,1
"From the time you arrive till you leave you will get the best hospitality ever...Alan, Marguerite and the whole team are very friendly & helpful...Great FoodGreat ServiceThank you to all Rocabella team",0
"My last year visit to Greece and Turkey for my Honeymoon, Mykonos turned out to be the best part of the honeymoon since Rocabella staff was well amazing. 1. They prepared special jain (vegetarian + no egg + no onion no garlic no potatoes) breakfast for me. 2. Alan the hotel manager, is very friendly and helps us in every way possible. 3. Our room overlooked the Aegan sea. It's a delight to see the blue sea day and night from the room. 4. They made special arrangements for our welcome with a wine bottle on 1st and last day of our stay. I guess only tough part to reach the hotel is you have pay for the pick up and drop. And cabs are scarce in Mykonos. I'm glad I stayed three nights in rocabella and will stay again when I visit Greece again. I would strongly recommend everyone to stay in Rocabella Mykonos.",0
"We had the pleasure of staying at the Rocabella Mykonos Art Hotel & Spa for our honeymoon and already have plans to go back. The grounds, the rooms, the views are all spectacular, and the staff is just first rate. They were always a pleasure to be around and offered us the best suggestions for things to see and places to eat on the island. Thank you to Alan, Margerita, and the rest of the staff for making our stay so very special!",0
"When I'm first step in Rocabella,I felt like home,it's cozy & beautiful,welcoming by Alan & Kosta.Alan is kindest,pleasant,professional & always positive.Kosta is a joker & endlessly polite.The staff extremely friendly & breakfasts is delicious.Amerisa is very fun lady,she treat me a tequila short when I was breakfast,she want me drunk in the morning If you are looking a romantic place,Rocabella is the best,decor is great all white with sea view,it feel like Greece<U+2764><U+FE0F>I'm going back my home in Mykonos on September as I promised.",0
"Wonderful location, facilities and people. Breathtaking views of the island. Excellent massage services and one of the most delicious breakfast in the island. Highly suggested, for people who want to relax and enjoy life. -------------",0
"Thank you to Alan, Margherita and the team for another wonderful stay! Cant fault anything! The room upgrade was a special touch and I cant wait to come back again! They helped us with anything we needed such as transfers and all sorts of restaurants/bars recommendations.Thank you for making our stay so wonderful",0
"Me & my partner stayed at rocabella for 3 nights as a surprise for his 30th, I emailed the hotel beforehand and arranged transfers and a nice surprise in the room. Roni (the hotel driver) was waiting at the airport to greet us even though our flight had been delayed. We was greeted at reception by the lovely Alan and Margarita with a glass of champagne waiting! We then checked in and Margarita sat down with us and recommended places to visit, the best bars and best restaurants before showing us to our room. We had a high floor room with a hot tub on the balcony, it was perfect location, with amazing views of Mykonos. We hired a quad on our first day which was so simple as we literally made our request at reception and the hire firm delivered the quad to reception within the hour. Breakfast was lovely! So much to choose from! Also the hotel shuttle to and from Mykonos town, was very useful, arriving every hour, and on time! We've had the most perfect 3 days and we will definitely be visiting again in the future! Can't recommend this hotel enough!",0
"Big Kudos to the Rocabella amazing Team!My May holidays were perfect beacuse of the magic place and amazing people combination. You can search for other places on the island, however when arrive here - You will have to come back.From outstanding service, mind-blowing food to the marvelous surroundings. This is a complete holiday experience that will stay in Your memory much longer than suntan on Your skin.Thanks Alan for Your company and best hidden Gems recommendation ;-)   Room Tip: Jacuzzi in the room...brilliant. See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for 4 nights on the 1st June and had the best time! We booked a standard room which was small but perfect for what we needed. The hotel is just stunning!! I couldn't stop taking photos and wishing it was my house. The pool area is lovely but was a little too chilled out for our liking! Totally understand that is what a lot of people want though so we did visit a few beaches which had beach bars/clubs! The breakfast was amazing with so much choice. The lunch was also brilliant! The staff were the best we have encountered almost anywhere! Roni, the mini bus driver was lovely, have us lots of advice and was always lovely to travel with and chat too. Alan the reception manager was amazing! He helped make our trip great. He recommended beaches, bars, restaurants and also arranged transfers and reservations with no problem at all. The night shift guy Ilias, was so much fun, really friendly and so interesting to talk to! I could go on and on but it would take forever. All in all we had a brilliant stay! Great value for money and we will be back next year!",0
"Stayed for a 4-nighter. First time in Mykonos. Best holiday we've had so far. Hotel staff very friendly, harmonious and helpful. Lovely touches to make our short stay the best, such as turn-down service with aromatherapy, complimentary massage, shuttle bus, bottled water...Breakfast buffet was the best with a huge selection. Freshly cooked omelettes to your choice and freshly squeezed orange juice etc. Superb lunch - recommend the mussels. Mostly couples here. Very chilled out. Would definitely recommend and would come again to Rocabella",0
"We spent 4 nights at Rocabella Mykonos and we really enjoyed the time spent there. The staff are very friendly and supportive; food and drinks are tasty and cheaper than local restaurants; free transportation to/from the town every hour; excellent view is much better than any places in the town; reasonable size of pool and comfortable sofa bed giving you a relaxing day. We have spent most time in the hotel during our stay apart from dinners out and definitely it has been the most relaxing hotel ever and the hotel has provided everything we need. Mykonos is just an island in Greece and it may be not much different from other islands, however, we will definitely visit Mykonos soon because of Rocabella which has given us a memorable holiday.   Room Tip: all rooms with views but some with outdoor Jacuzzi. See more room tips",0
"I visited the hotel two times, very professional stuff. Great hotel with one the best views in mykonos! The kitchen team are very high of expectations an really good! Tha pool bar and the cocktail bar very good! The service staff areFriendly and flexible !",0
"My wife and I had room 103 which was a Jr Suite with an outdoor hot tub. The outside patio was very long with 4 lounge chairs at the end and a hot tub right outside the room along with a table and chairs. The view from the patio was amazing! View overlooked the sea, only detractors are the power lines that run across in front of the property. Turn down service is uniquely fun. Margarita and Allen provided amazing service. Margarita went above and beyond finding us a sailing excursion to nearby islands. We ate at the hotel for breakfast everyday and dinner several times. The eating area for both are around the pool overlooking the beautiful view. Breakfast buffet was great with plenty of options including several fun Greek plates. Dinner menu didn't have a ton of options but we loved everything we tried.Pool is stunning with a great view of the sea. Plenty of lounge chairs and couches with bar service available. Shuttle to Mykonos Town is very helpful, we didn't end up renting a car.   Room Tip: Get room with outside hot tub. Staff is helpful, be sure to ask for suggestions. See more room tips",0
"My first review ever , so please bear with me and apologies if I waffle on . All the previous praise of this wonderful hotel is correct , so I may not repeat all comments made before . Alan , who comes ""from Russia with love "" ( though you would never know it , he reminded me of Apollo ! ) , has the hotel running seamlessly . He greats and looks after EVERY guest like they were his closet family . He was generous , kind , and very good at chess . We had no music with us , I called Alan , next time we entered our wonderful room there was great music playing , which he wouldn't except back . We changed room , another generous act , to the most incredible room with huge outside space , and I couldn't work the CD player . Within less than 2 minutes their wonderful fixer , Anestis , had shown me what I was doing wrong . I must also mention Ilias , who worked nights and greeted us every night with shots and water . Anna who's smile was huge , Amerisa who kept us VERY entertained whilst mixing great cocktails , Leuteris who is very sweet and bought cappuccino to my sun bed every morning , no extra charge , included in the great breakfast ! Lastly Ronni who drove us many times and was always on time . Location brilliant , hotel and pool spotless , beach is not 5 min away its 3 , if you take the short cut down the White stairs by the small chapel , beach is very nice with 3 tavernas , the one up a few steps over looks the beach . Water free and everywhere in hotel , very unusual . Air conditioning units where quiet and brand new , beds and pillows fantastic . Gym great , massage INCREDIBLE . Mykonos town was beautiful , stunning . I would eat inside the maze of alleys rather than the slightly touristy front and you must try Jackie o at super paradise , it's a lot of fun ! We are fortunate that we have travelled to many Greek islands and many 4/5 star boutique hotels . However , service , attitude and staff can often be hit and miss . At Rocabella you will want for nothing . Oh and the clientele wasn't bad either , especially the Swiss :)  Many thanks to everyone at Rocabella who made our trip X",1
"Cool, elegant, arty, friendly, special, memorable ... but one can't have everything I guess. I loved the fact that it was a little way out of busy Mykonos Town (but still handy for nipping in to enjoy the buzz ... making use of the well managed courtesy car). Also visited the sister hotel on Santorini ... but for me this place takes first prize. George and his brilliant team deserve a lot of credit.   Room Tip: All great ... Well designed See more room tips",0
"Cannot say anything bad about this hotel, only positive things. All was amazing!!! Food, pool, rooms and personal are the best!!! I stayed there only 3 days, but these days were perfect!!!Segey Stepanenko, Moscow, Russia!!!",0
"Firstly I would like to say that my husband and I NEVER visit the same place twice, too many places in the world to see and explore. However for Rocabella we made an exception, and we would definitely visit again!From the warm greeting at the airport from Ronni, (the Rocabella driver) to the exceptional check inn by Alan and the absolutely lovely reception team led by Margarita.... My champagne glass was never empty. Alan will go through the map of the island with you and suggest many restaurants, if you follow Alan's suggestions for places to eat you cannot go wrong. The food on the island is just wonderful and I believe suits all budgets, from a tasty souvlaki lunch to a seafood dinner, the food is wonderfully fresh and delicious. (I miss it already).Our bags were brought to our beautiful seafront suite, and I believe we had the best views of the island from our private Jacuzzi. We made great use of the Jacuzzi and used it 2-3 times a day. There was a lovely bottle of champagne awaiting us when we arrived in our room, which we drank..... you guessed it, in the Jacuzzi. It was my birthday the day after we arrived and the chef made me a cake, that the staff brought to our table whilst singing happy birthday and on our arrival back to our room that evening a lovely birthday card and bottle of champagne was left for us. What a really nice thing to do, but that's the kind of personalized service you get from Rocabella. We hired an ATV for a few days and we did that through Rocabella. They took the stress out of this process for us. They arranged everything and the ATV was delivered and collected from the hotel. We used it to explore the island, to check out a few beaches and a few taverns that we highly recommend, Fokos beach and tavern is lovely and Kiki's is a 'must do' for food and the scenery is out of this world.We ate in the hotel restaurant 3 or 4 times, one time having the food delivered to our room, we ate on our terrace in the sunshine. The food is outstanding! :)The reason I said that our 2nd visit was even better than our first, is simply because this time we knew the Island, and we were so totally relaxed, after a few days we totally forgot what day is was! What a blissfully relaxing holiday!Overall the hotel is beautiful, with stunning views. But it is the staff of the hotel and the amazing service that makes this particular hotel outstanding! I imagine at some point in the future we will return again, as Rocabella now has a little piece of my heart! :)Once again Alan, thank you and all of the wonderful staff at Rocabella for looking after us! We had the best time! We will come back again!   Room Tip: All rooms are stunning. I would pay a little extra and get a room with a jacuzzi. See more room tips",0
"A big Thank You to everyone at the Rocabella hotel, especially to Alan. You made us feel very welcome and looked after us to the maximum! The breakfast and food over all was amazing. The views from our rooms were unforgettable. Highly recommend rooms with a private jacuzzi. It made our stay even more special. Have many happy memories from this place and would definitely love to come back! Looking forward to my next visit at this fantastic place!!",0
"Fantastic hotel with great service from all of the staff. Breakfast is amazing, who doesn't want a banoffee pot for breakfast?! Delicious! The staff couldn't have been more helpful, from booking us car hire to the free shuttle bus to getting us dressing gowns etc.The only reasons I've given 4 star rating and not 5 are:- ROOM - our room had no full length mirror which makes it hard to get dressed for a night out to see if your shoes go with the outfit! Might not be important to most people but I would have liked this and there was plenty of room to put one. Also, lack of towel rails in the bathroom. Only 2 hooks for the dressing gowns and lack of storage for the towels. A rail would have fit on the wall or a shelf under the sink. There was a note in the room to be environmental and reuse your towels so only if you wanted them changing to put them on the floor. We were happy to reuse towels and never put them on the floor but they were changed for new ones twice a day! This seems excessive and not at all environmental! Also, lack of consistency replacing free items. A few times the water was not replaced, twice we had no coffee and the green tea bags were never replaced so had to get them from breakfast area.RESTAURANT - The worst thing for us was that they allowed smoking in the restaurant area. There were no ashtrays on the tables in that area but people just used the floor or went to get the ashtrays from the pool area. One morning at breakfast there were three other tables of people all smoking. This ruined our normally enjoyable breakfast experience and we couldn't wait to leave the area.BAR - No drinks menu with prices. You can ask for any cocktail or coffee etc to see if they can make it but you don't know how much it is or what the alternatives are. Would be nice to see a menu.These are mostly minimal things and the overall stay was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are lovely with great balconies and the views are lovely. We never struggled to get a sun lounger around the pool and the four poster beds are very comfy. Everyone was helpful and the free water, wi-fi, gym and free shuttle bus (hourly) are welcome services. The fact that they take your room number when you are having breakfast and then clean your room during this time so it is all done for you when you return to your room is exceptional.",1
"Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel for two nights as part of our honeymoon and was so disappointed when we were leaving!This hotel offers the best customer service and the owner really makes your stay special with recommendations on restaurants, places to see etc.He knew it was our honeymoon and gave us a beautiful room and a complimtary bottle of wine which was such a nice touch!! It is worth every cent to receive such a high standard of service. Room was lovely, very clean and had its own small terrace. Could not recommend this hotel more highly! We will definitely return!",0
"Well done MarioThis is one of the best hotel stays we have had as a family! Personalised service, attention to every detail and the perfect host for a truly memorable Mykonos experience.If you want an authentic and luxurious Mykonos experience Lithos by Spiros & Flora truly is ""As good as it gets""!",0
"An amazing hotel.Absolutely perfect in every possible way. Immaculate service,great rooms,4 minute walk to the beach. Mario(owner)is absolutely a great host. Always ready to help if you have any questions. He and his staff go out of their way to help.Modern and impeccable rooms with amazing views.   Room Tip: All rooms are great. Mine was a junior suite with a great view of the water and 2 private balconies. See more room tips",0
"We first saw this hotel 2 years ago, whilst staying in the Amos Hotel in Ornos, which was awful. The hotel is small but beautifully formed with everything you need and the most amazing owner, Marios. The location is perfect, with the beach a short walk away, via steep hill, watch the sunbed prices(!!), and the bus stop right outside for Mykonos town. Unlike so many Hotels in Mykonos, it is evident that Marios cares about both the Hotel and his clients, for this we were grateful and enjoyed our stay immensely. I would recommend this hotel highly and recommend a room overlooking the pool and the sea view.   Room Tip: choose a room overlooking the pool. See more room tips",0
"Lovely boutique hotel with spacious clean apartment-style rooms and lovely quiet pool area with bar. Best service of any hotel I have ever stayed in! Manager greeted us and spent 20mins or so informing us of thing to do, restaurants, transport options, etc. Staff took pride in helping us/showing us room and facilities. They even gave us a lift to our next place of residence free of charge (as we were planning on walking the relatively short distance). Only stayed one night between accommodations and regret not staying longer. Good location with town bus access, and close to the beach. Overall, fantastic value for money!",0
"Comfortable, elegant, accommodating, very good ambiance. The manager (Marius)is very pleasant, communicative and efficient. This hotel have an amazing view, with pool and bus stop in front of and you take 15 min to downtown. This hotel is impressive and have very good prices. I recommend.",0
Great place to be. Extremely cordial reception and hospitality. Very conveniently yet peacefully located. The management and staff are very helpful in giving tips and recommending places to visit around. Very pleased with our stay and would love to return back.,0
"We were not sure if Mykonos was for us – from what we heard we thought - daughter too young, we too old but we all LOVED Mykonos and Lithos made our stay extra special. On the next island we stayed at a super exclusive boutique hotel and we all still missed Marios, Petko and Lithos which says it all!!Great location in Agios Ionnisis – quiet and away from the bustle of Mykonos town but a 10 minute bus ride away with the bus at your door step.Rooms – Large and well-furnished and comfortable. We had a lovely terrace with view of the pool and sea…blissful and a great place to watch the stars at night!Pool – Large enough and well maintained. More than enough chairs and a lovely pool bar…which gets even better when the very charming owner, Marios makes you his special Mojitos!Breakfast – A Greek cold breakfast of more than you can eat served by the pool …Service – Have left this to the end as this is what makes this hotel special. From Marios is Welcome presentation of what to do in Mykonos (we pretty much followed this and through our plans out the window!) to the great mojitos and even our last chat when he felt bad that I mentioned I was not a great fan of cold breakfast….all made the experience so personal and special. All the staff at the hotel mirror his hospitality – nothing was too much for Petco and the lovely lady at the pool bar.   Room Tip: The pool facing rooms with the terrace are worth the extra!! See more room tips",2
"This hotel truly sets the highest standard, and you can see this pursuit of excellence through the competence and warmth of Marios and the staff here.It's rare for me to use words like ""flawless"" - but I have to give full credit where it's due: the rooms, the common areas and the staff were all a notch above. We tried (accidently!) to find ways to trip them up by losing our keys twice but all they were interested in was helping us enjoy our holiday and sorting out the key issues themselves. The rooms were clean and spacious and an absolute delight to stay in. The pool area was similarly well presented with a mini bar - special mention to the glass of ice water that was brought out to me whilst sun bathing without even asking: that is the sign of a 5 star mentality.We absolutely will return to the Cyclades one day... and absolutely will stay at Lithos by Spyros & Flora without a doubt.",2
"We landed in Mykonos with the news that our luggage was lost in transit. Upset, we reached the hotel (picked up by the hotel) and they gave us the best service. We reached quite late in the night, so we were really hungry. Marios, the owner and his wife contacted his friend who runs a restaurant there and asked him to pick us up to his restaurant, as it was too late to get any transport facility. The next morning, since one of our luggage was lost, we didn't even have toothpaste. He got one from his home and gave it to us. He helped us with everything he could. The rooms were so comfortable, clean and perfect. The view from there was beautiful. The best stay despite the fact that we lost our luggage. Highly recommended.",3
"My friend and i stayed here last August and have booked again for this year. The owners are delightful and couldnt be more helpful. We were picked up efficiently from the airport and its only a 15 minute (max) drive. The hotel overlooks the sea from the pool and has a small bar. The rooms were big and airy, very clean and comfortable. We had a twin room and it was perfect. I had a delicious halloumi salad from the bar which was perfect. The hotel is a short walk from the beach, and the bus to Mykonos town goes from right outside the hotel and takes only 10 minutes or so. Its a perfect and affordable gem of a hotel on this beautiful island. highly recommend.",0
"Can't praise this gem of a hotel enough. Lovely property, exquisitely designed and maintained with an incredible staff - Marios, Petko and the always-smiling girl serving us breakfast (whose name, to my shame, I just can't remember). Breakfast with a jaw-dropping view over the Aegean at the pool area that also has a bar. But the best part is the service- Marios' personal touch oversees everything. He told us about his signature Mojito and then made them for my wife and me- on the house.The bus stop to town is literally outside the hotel with frequent bus connections.Would recommend this without reservation- go stay here!",2
"Very nice place to stay, nice rooms, view, pool, short walk to the beach. Hosts were very helpful and ready to organise everything when and if needed. Not far from the city of Mykonos and the bus stop is just in front of the house. we wouldnt mind coming back soon :)",1
Very nice & personal attention for your best experience & guidance by owner himself good location & view Big rooms & comfortable stay <U+270C><U+FE0F>reasonable & moderate charges worth Mykonos trip picturesque pool view & pleasant bar with minimal food available at poolside,0
"The hotel is beautiful and with a great view, nearby theres a beach and a few restaurants, the rooms are really comfy and the air conditioner works great. But the best is the service given by the staff, they treat you as family. I totally recommed these hotel.",1
"I really liked the hotel, the accommodation is great. the hotel is small and offers a beautiful view, it is very clean and cute. the breakfast is good and it is a short bus trip from the town. good price and very well recommended.",1
"the room was very clean... the owner: Marius-- very helpful, extra miler.. thanks for making our stay a very memorable one. The is no elevator, one of our friends had difficulty in walking up & down (going to the room), Marius offered his personal car to ferry our friend to/from the room",1
"We had a last minute change of plans when travelling through the Greek islands and stumbled upon this little gem of a hotel. The owner, Marios, is extremely friendly and helpful. He goes out of his way to accommodate his guests. The property itself is well laid-out, flawlessly clean and has spacious suites with beautiful views from the balcony. The breakfast is the best we had in Greece and includes a variety of food items. The hotel is directly across the street from a nice beach that offers sun umbrellas and beach loungers. I wish that we had had more than just one night at this beautiful property and I would definitely plan a return visit.",2
"Lithos may surprise you with amazing views, location and comfort. The hotel is a new and very beautiful, our superior room was perfect and very clean. Good balance of money = quality. Mario will help you with advices how to spend a good time at Mykonos! 5 of 5",2
This hotel is not only beautiful and located near great beaches but had modern and spacious rooms. The owner was extremely helpful and friendly. We only wish that we had planned to stay for more days (we were there two days).,1
"H and I booked Lithos as a very last-minute honeymoon and we could not have been happier with our choice. As soon as we made our reservation, there was an e-mail from owner Marios to arrange our transfer to the hotel, giving us all the options. In the end, we went with a private transfer that picked us up at Mykonos Airport.On arrival at the hotel, Marios sat down with us and gave us a very detailed guide to the area around the hotel and Mykonos in general as it was our first time visiting the island. Our room was very spacious and had every amenity you could want with a fantastic view of the sea.The pool area was lovely with plenty of sun loungers and a nice bar area. This was also where breakfast was served. At 9 euros per person, the breakfast plate was an absolute bargain with an amazing selection of items served along with orange juice and coffee/tea. Agios Ioannis beach is a short walk away and is very quiet which was perfect for what we wanted. There are three restaurants in the area, but if you want to take a trip to Mykonos town or nearby Ornos there is a bus stop right outside the hotel.All in all I cannot praise Lithos enough. Marios and his staff took such excellent care of us treating us like family members and I can see why the hotel has so many repeat visitors. We can't wait to come back!",2
"Situated in a quiet locality, Lithos is a beautiful Property with Ocean View. It is away from all the noise yet easily reachable to all the key places including City Centre and Beaches. The best part is that the Bus Stop is right outside the Hotel. There is also a local Beach nearby. So is a Grocery Shop. This review won't be complete without the mention of the owner, Mr. Marios. He is an extremely helpful and patient man who looks after his guests with love. The detailed "" Things to Do in Mykonos"" briefing at the time of Arrival is very helpful and touches your heart with it's sincerity. He even sent his own car to drop us to help us save time to reach the Beach as we had missed the Bus. Overall, it was a fantastic stay in fantastic Mykonos.",2
"Our first visit in Mykonos at hotel Lithos was as if we were embraced by a loving family. Any thoughtful thing possible was done by Marios. My sister had difficulty walking up the driveway...no problem she was driven up to the room. We wanted to stay at the beach across the street...no problem they drove her from the beach across the street. We had some thoughts for dinner, Marios recommended his favorites or his wife's favorites and they all were wonderful. The hotel was spotless, the view form the second floor was amazing and again the service was outstanding. The bus stop is right outside the door.",0
"Me and my friends stayed for two nights in Lithos and everything about it was amazing, starting with Marios who was a great host and provided us with a warm welcome and lots of tips and information about the town, beaches, transportation and restaurants. We stayed in suites with a beach view and it was unbeatable. The beach is just 5 minutes away walking and is very easy to move around mykonos with the bus services, the bus stop is just outside the hotel and we had no problem using them.",2
The room was great beautiful views and the staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Also very close to bus stop. They sat down with us and told us about the island with recommendations of activities and restaurants. We would recommend staying here to anyone.,3
"We were surprised by how modern and spacious the room was. The hotel is newly renovated. It is stylishly furnished, very clean and comfortable. The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. The bus stop is just outside of hotel. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the Mykonos old town. Bus is once every hour.",1
"On Mykonos for 3 nights. Found great deal on Trip Advisor for a Jr Suite. Quite happily surprised with well appointed kitchenette, living room, bedroom, 2 bathrooms and 2 balconies. Beautiful pool area with bar and amazing ocean view was a slice of heaven! The staff is fabulous and cater to your every need. Bonus...just a couple of bus stops from a mani/pedi!!!",0
"I didn't expect this hotel to be so clean and comfortable. We arrived at 8am at the hotel, after a 30min flight from Athens, and when we arrived, Mario, the manager (I guess) helped us a lot with the main tourist attractions and also with the car rental. He was fantastic, as well as all the other workers there. Our suite was very very big, comfortable beds and huge space. The view was just incredible. We had a delicious breakfast while looking at the amazing view that the hotel offers you. The hotel itself it located about a less than 10 min drive to the city center, and just a short walk from a nice beach. I wish I could stay longer!   Room Tip: best views, location, family trip See more room tips",1
"This establishment was the best hospitality anyone can offer. I was very impressed by the staff and the owners. Upon early arrival they allowed us to store our bags. They gave excellent recommendations to the town. The room: Free wifi, comfortable, very clean rooms, huge kitchen, trendy decor, patio. The cost: We did go off season, but the price was very reasonable.Amenities: The pool is gorgeous with an ocean view. The bar produced delicious drinks. Its in walking distance to a nearby beach, and the sunset is not bad either. Hosts: The hosts are what blew us away. We spent some time with the owner and his wife getting to know Greece and its appealing charm. We also played with his kids. They are a lovely family and were very accommodating to our every need. Overall: I would highly recommend staying here with friends/family/romantic getaways to really experience Greece and all of its beauty.",1
"A really quiet spot on an otherwise too busy island. Close to the beach and with fabulous views across the bay. We stayed in a suite overlooking the pool that was stunning and immaculate. The pool area was clean and quiet, except when our son was in the pool. There was an annoying cabin crew chap, full of his own self-importance who liked to hold court at the pool, but you can't hold him against the owners. The only downside was that breakfast and the initial check in were a bit OCD by Flora which made us feel a little uncomfortable. A buffet breakfast would have been much better and my son was unimpressed by the muesli, but then he's eight so likes sugary stuff.",3
"First, the hotel is very nice and has a pretty decent view. Obstructed by power lines and such, which you can see in the pictures so that's not a surprise. But, for the price you can't beat it. Plus, it's a 5 minute walk to Agios Ionnis beach. I would argue this beach has the best sunset view in all of Mykonos. Watch the movie Shirley Valentine...it looks JUST like that. The bus system also makes it pretty easy to get to other parts of the island. In the off season the buses run every hour instead of half hour so it's a little harder to get around, but still do-able. The rooms are modern, clean and have everything you need.Now for the reasons why this hotel stands above all of the rest! It's the incredibly helpful and friendly staff!! Let's start with when I first arrived. I was given a very detailed ""Mykonos 101"" tutorial by the nice lady at the front desk. She told me how to get around on the buses and ferries and where all of the key attractions are located (including the ferries to Delos). They also gave me a 1BR suite instead of a studio! I'm sure the upgrade was because it was the end of the season, but still nice of them. They didn't have to do that. Finally, how the staff saved my vacation. On the last day there, the rain and wind started to pick up and my ferry to Santorini was cancelled. I, of course, didn't know that because the website for superjets (do not use them!!) provided no information or help with cancellations. One of the staff called the port and helped me find out when my ferry had been rescheduled (from the morning to much later in the afternoon). Since my ferry had been delayed they let me stay in the room and still allowed me to order room service even though it was literally the last day the hotel was open for the season. No joke, they were folding up pool chairs as I was leaving :-) I could have spent that day in the rain or sitting at the port with all of my luggage for the entire day had the staff not called the port to find out when my ferry had been rescheduled and allowed me to stay in my room. They also rescheduled my transfer from the hotel to the port (btw...that's also a good service and well worth the money). I can't say enough wonderful things about this staff and hotel. As far as places to go during the day I'd go to platis gialos, but then head back to agios ionnis for the sunset. But, as far as hotels go...stay here!!",3
"What a lovely spot. After traveling around Greece for 2 weeks, this had to be by far the largest room we stayed in. What I loved perhaps the most was relaxing in the chairs by the pool, overlooking the gorgeous scenery, reading a book. Mykonos in general can be a party island, but this was truly a serene getaway from it all.The hospitality of the staff is wonderful. We ended up renting a 4 wheeler in town for a day and they let us go ahead and store it in the garage overnight. They are quick to offer suggestions on how to get around, where to go, and a glass of wine while lounging at the pool of course.The ONLY reason I am giving this less than the perfect 5 stars is because it's a bit too far from town to walk...and if you happen to be backpacking, good luck climbing up the steep drive :) The bus is literally at the entrance to the hotel so that's exceptionally convenient to get around.",4
"Fantastic service, including complimentary transfers from the airport and to Mykonos port at the end of our stay, friendly hosts, a superb bedroom suite, great breakfasts, amazing views, lovely pool and a quiet beach a few mins walk away. Our only gripe was that the sofa bed wasn't terribly comfortable, but so glad we stayed here and not at one of Mykonos's busier beach resorts. Highly recommended!",2
"Quite a new hotel with very comfortable facilities, lovely location and great service. On the map it might look far from everything but in reality is easily reached by car, bus (the stop is literally in front of the hotel with services every 30min) or renting a ATV which is handy and fun to see the island. There are few choices to eat/drink around so you'll be limited compared to town but again, is easy to get nearby walking (15mins to Ornos beach) or by bus (30 mins to town). Also, Konstantins restaurants offers free transport for patrons - will make a separate entry about this great restaurant!The owners give your lots of information and advice upon arrival and are always around to answer questions.The rooms also have a compact but well supplied kitchen if you fancied cooking yourself. Might be handy if you are staying long and fancy some homemade food. The hotel offers breakfast in the terrace and has bar by the pool.Our room was very spacious - with a big sofa, a table for 4, a mini kitchen - and so comfortable! It had a nice balcony with a beautiful view over the pool and the sea. During the day is a bit noisy and lacks of privacy as it is quite a small hotel but once you close the windows (double glazing) and blinds you don't hear a thing and have the most perfect night sleep.The sunbathing area is perfect for relaxing and sipping a couple of cocktails.The only downside we can find is the music at the bar....dull 'easy listening'. The closest beach (3mins downhill) is tiny and not that pretty but a 15mins walk takes you to Ornos where on the north side a big windy bay offers great kitesurfing and on the south side a protected bay is great for swimming and relaxing. We had a great time and were very sad to leave.....   Room Tip: Sea view rooms have balconies overlooking the pool and sea - otherwise the rooms have a small 'p... See more room tips",5
"We were looking for a bit of peace, excellent service, not too far from the maddening crowd but with easy access to good food...we go just that. A short walk to the [Shirley Valentine - hello rock] beach, and great restaurants, or a short bus ride to Mykonos town (very easy). Fantastic sea views and terrace (not all rooms)., pool etc.",1
"My husband and I stayed for several days and nights at Lithos. It has the bed and breakfast feel with the amenities of a hotel. Very clean, beautiful pool, outstanding sunset and sunrise views, and a great location to do day trips to town or other areas of the island.",0
"Our room was very spacious, with a kitchenette area. Spotlessly clean. Comfortable bed. Efficient AC.We did not use our terrace because a large electric transformer blocked the view, but stayed by the pool, one floor above, to enjoy the view to the Aegean Sea.Marios, the landlord, was absolutely great: he picked us up from the airport, and drove us several times to places we wanted to get to to avoid us taking the bus (although the bus stop is right in front of the hotel, but not so frequent during the day) or walking uphill in the heat in our nice clothes (wedding at St John's hotel).We were given as many bottles of water as we needed. Pool towels were provided.Great value for money, and the feeling of being so welcome.   Room Tip: Ask for a room above the swimming pool See more room tips",1
"Was recommended by 2 friends to stay here, they were exactly right in their recommendations... We had an awesome time here, the attention to small detail was great. The ambiance of the room & balcony resulted in a very relaxing time for us. We also enjoyed the bar - BEST Martini Expresso by the way, if it's not on the list just ask. We enjoyed the location and the small beach further down the road. Marios gives great food recommendations and the bus stop is right out front. I hope I get to go back for longer next time. Thanks Lithos for an awesome time :)",1
"Right from the time the owner Marios welcomes you at the door, you know he loves what he does - and it makes a difference! He earnestly and passionately gives you a comprehensive orientation of Mykonos - what to see, where to eat and shop, using public transport, etc - complete with hand-annotated maps. We expressed interest in local preserved fruit and he sent us away with a jar of fruit in syrup made by his parents! The hotel has a soothing modern aesthetic with spotless rooms / bathroom, the breakfast was huge and filling and they provide complementary beach towels if you go to the beach (approx 200 m across the street). We were concerned about the location at the time of booking but it's very convenient to move around by public bus from the hotel, especially to go to town (Hora) but we were glad we rented an ATV on the day we went beach hopping because it saved a lot of time. Booking hotel - airport / port transfers through Marios is highly recommended as taxis can be hard to get.",0
"We booked this hotel to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary and I have to say that every single second of our stay felt so special. It was wonderful to wake up each morning to see a beautiful blue sea and such breath taking scenery. We were given a map to explore the area, but we were so blissfully happy, we decided to stay local, walk to the beach and sit by the lovely clean pool. Marios and his team were so attentive during our stay. The Junior Suite was stunning with 2 shower rooms, spacious bedroom & sitting area, plus a lovely balcony. If I could give a rating of 10000000 for this hotel I would!!   Room Tip: Choose the Junior Suite, well worth it. See more room tips",2
"There is no doubt in my mind that I would love to return to Mykonos, and no doubt either that I will choose to stay here. We met other tourists (not staying at Lithos) out and about during our week on the island who were seasoned Mykonos-returnees, some of whom were still on the quest to find their perfect place to stay. I feel very fortunate that as a first time visitors to this wonderful island we chose to stay at the place that Marios and Marina have clearly lovingly created. We were warmly welcomed, and instantly felt very relaxed. Marios and Marina, and all of their excellent team, actively want to make sure that you enjoy your stay. The level of service and charming personal attention we received was truly excellent. Breakfast is great, served on the terrace with a view that I will remember for a long time. During the daytime if you choose to relax ‘at home’ rather than seeking out a spot on a beach, the pool deck is a wonderfully relaxing place with a good selection of tasty food and drinks available, comfortable loungers and perfectly judged mood music played at just the right level at points during the afternoon. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very comfortably, stylishly furnished. We went into Mykonos Town almost every evening, a very easy inexpensive 10 minute bus ride away from right outside the hotel and sampled some great restaurants. We also went to a restaurant in nearby Ornos on two evenings, and were picked up and dropped back by the restaurant team. Marios picked us up from, and delivered us back to, the airport, and took us to the airport on another occasion to collect our rental car. It really felt during our whole stay that we were being very well looked after. There are some places you travel to that you really don’t want to leave; Lithos is one of those. We left with wonderful memories of an exceptional stay and fantastically kind people. The many 5* reviews on this site for Lithos are well deserved. Until the next time. Thank you!",3
Our first time in Greece but we are impressed by the standard of accommodation and food. The people are trying hard to please and encourage tourists to come.This is a lovely spacious modern and renovated hotel. The owners are helpful and everyone is a high standard. The breakfast is very reasonable lyrics priced and would satisfy anyon,1
"We had the privilege of staying at Lithos by Spyros & Flora during our 3 day visit to Mykonos and had no regrets whatsoever.Arriving at Mykonos Airport via Athens in the morning, we were greeted at the airport by the owner Marios and driven to the hotel free of charge. As we arrived at 7AM in the morning, our room was not available yet so we decided to explore Old Mykonos Town, at which point Marios provided us free transportation into the town center (10 minutes drive). Furthermore, Marios drove us to the ferry port when we checked out free of charge, another plus.The hotel itself is extremely modern with an amazing view of the sea from the pool area. The room is massive, complete with a modern clean shower, high ceilings, clean floors/walls, and a mini kitchen. The wifi is not very strong in the room, but it definitely was not an issue as we came to see Mykonos. The only regret we had was not having time to experience the amazing looking pool.The area that the hotel is located is roughly 20 minutes by bus from the town center of Mykonos Town. However, getting to the town is extremely convenient with the bus stop literally outside the hotel often, at a cost of 1.80 euros per person per ride which goes directly to the town center (from which you can get to all of the major attractions in Mykonos). Furthermore, we were thankful staying in a peaceful area overlooking the sea, away from the busy Mykonos town, a good escape each night. Do keep in mind that the hotel rooms are up a hill, so those with mobility issues and are not driving should consider this factor.The main highlight of the boutique hotel would be the amazing and caring service provided by the hotel owners. They will take the time to cater to your requests, provide you with maps and honest recommendations, help you plan your days, and go out of their way to make your visit that much more convenient. We definitely would stay here again when we visit Mykonos.   Room Tip: Make sure to ask for a room with a pool view overlooking the sea. It is incredible. See more room tips",3
"Lithos is definitely in a class of its own. The level of attention to guests' needs, the quality of interaction with them, the beautiful views from the hotel, the friendliness and the nuanced interactions with different types of guests denote a very sensitive approach to hosting as well as something which one cannot learn: some people are born to host, and Marios and Marina clearly fall in this category. The warmth with which we were welcomed and throughout our stay will remain, I believe, unrivalled. The rooms are huge with a great view to the sea, the swimming pool area is quiet and lovely. The cleanliness is faultless. The bus stop is just outside the hotel and you are within a 10 minute ride to Mykonos Town city centre, so really well located. The hotel is also very close to the airport. Marios was extremely kind and both picked us up from the airport on arrival and drove us to the airport to catch our plane. I'd perhaps just change one thing: I would stay longer than a week. This may all sound perhaps too superlative, but if it does it is because at Lithos you will feel as important and individual as perhaps no where else you'll ever stay, independently of how much you pay for your accommodation. Thank you Marios, Marina, and Petkos for a wonderful stay and see you again very soon!",1
"Our last hotel stay on our two week island trip and Lithos exceeded our expectations. After being met by the owner at the port and taken to the hotel we had a lovely room with sea view. As others have stated the rooms are huge and very well finished and very clean. I have to say the friendliness of the owners and staff was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble.Breakfast was like the rooms - huge with a wide array to please everyone. Pool was a welcome relief from the heat and the sun balcony had fine views.Bus stop right outside the hotel and only ten minutes into the main town. We enjoyed it locally, good beach below with a few restaurants.As to price I thought it was very fair.",3
"This is our second time in the Lithos hotel. The first time was so wonderful that we chose to come back and enjoy the beautiful island of Mykonos some more. Marios and Marina are wonderful hosts and will make sure everything is taken care of. I can't stress this enough - don't miss out of Marios' amazing drinks at the pool bar! The rooms are lovely and spacious, very clean with amazing views of the sea. This time we also chose to rent a quad bike which was helpful for getting around the island's beautiful beaches. However, getting around using the bus is also pretty easy and quick, especially going to town at night, if you'd prefer not renting a car or quad. All in all - an amazing experience once again at Lithos. Can't wait to come back.   Room Tip: Go for the ocean view room or suite, it's well worth it! See more room tips",1
"Stayed here after a one week sailing boat holiday, and it was a real treat to come and stay in there HUGE modern rooms, with extremely comfortable beds. The pool was relaxing and the bar service really nice. We had a great stay and would recommend it, but we did find it a bit pricey, at €180 a night in mid august. If you can get a better deal, its definitely worth it.",0
"We shopped all around and stayed in several different places on Mykonos and this hotel is far and away the greatest value you will find -- but that is not to say that it is a bare bones ""value hotel."" We stayed in the ""Junior Sweet"" and it was huge and luxurious. Everything was very modern and immaculately clean. Our sea view was amazing, and our balcony was so spacious. The beds were very comfortable. The rooftop pool and bar were so nice--like that of a high end luxury hotel. The entire staff was extremely kind and accommodating. Marios and Marina--the owners, were unbelievably kind and personally available and helpful. They were there to answer any questions and helped us with getting around Mykonos. Oh, and the public busses literally pick up right in front the hotel! This place was perfect and we will be back.",1
"Its around 5km from airport, on the main road easy to find it. Room was big probably size of most 1 bed room apartment in metropolitan cities, clean, tidy, daily cleaning services including change of linen & towels. Pool was again clean, well maintained, service faultless, even they dropped us to port while leaving. View from room & pool was good except the fact that electricity transformer right in front of the hotel partly obscuring the view on right side but this not hotels fault. We didn't use the breakfast so can't comment. Poolside service again brilliant. This place is run by a couple & its a decent size hotel so hats off to them for the service & maintenance.",1
"We stayed at Lithos in August, and it was a haven of peace compared to the bustle of the rest of the island.Comfortable rooms, nice pool, but what impressed us was especially the precision, the availability and kindness of Mario and his staff ... THANK YOU !!!",0
"We went here in august is a comfortable hotel very clean everything new and well done, the bedroom in large with a wonderful view, we were in a budget room that is nice as the other . A Very very very important detail is that there is next to the wc an handle that you can use as bidet for your personal cleaning. The owners and everyone who works in Lithos hotel is very kind and available to offer you an excellent service.In my opinion lithos hotel can be compared to a 4 stars hotel. The area where is the hoel is beautiful calm and well served with bus for the mykoson town , you can get the seaside in 4 minutes walking with ombrella and sunbeds that are the cheaper of mykonos from 12 to 35 euro a couple.Thanks to the Lithos staff I wish you great success !Arrivederci!",0
"We arrived at Mykonos port expecting to be met by a taxi but instead Marios was there to meet us. He explained that he was the hotel owner and that with so few taxis on the island it was easier for him to collect guests when he could. It was a great start to our stay in his beautiful hotel.On arrival he handed us over to his lovely wife Marina who checked us in and went through the map, explaining in detail where all the good beaches, restaurants etc were and the best way to get to them. We were early so had to wait a little while to be able to get into our room, so Marina directed to the pool and bar area where we relaxed with a drink, some lunch and a refreshing swim.As soon as the room was ready we moved in and couldn't believe how lovely it was.From check in to check out we were very happy with our stay at Lithos.Owners and staff - Marios and Marina were very attentive to all our needs and are justifiably very proud of their hotel. They work very hard to maintain everything to an extremely high standard. The gorgeous Petko can be found at the pool and bar area from early in the morning till very late at night. He makes a mean cocktail and is great to have a chat with. The cleaning staff quietly and efficiently go about their work. They keep the apartments spotless.Breakfast - Enormous! Enough for 2 people for €8.5, consisted of fresh bread, cheese, ham, turkey, fresh yoghurt with muesli and honey, sweet and savoury pastries, orange juice and bottomless tea or coffee.Position- not in Mykonos town but about 10-15 minutes drive away. In a quieter area across the road from three restaurants and a beach. There is a bus stop out the front door but to fully access the island's attractions a car would be advisable.The apartments- furnished and appointed to a very high standard. Comfortable bed. Lots of powerpoints. We had an apartment with a separate bedroom which was very comfortable and spacious. Spotless.Cons- the hotel is built on the side of a steep hill so the rooms may prove difficult to access for people with mobility issues.Overall we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend Lithos by Spiros and Flora.",0
"Away from the crowds yet the bus stop is on the doorstep to get around. Absolutely loved our stay. Reception was more than helpful with orientating us with the island on arrival going through recommended restaurants, bars and tourist attractions. The rooms were stunning with views over the pool and ocean. It was a welcome breK from the hustle & bustle of our Europe trip.",0
"Last year my family and I visited Lithos by Spyros & Flora for the first time. We had such an amazing time that we returned again this year. Arriving at Mykonos airport we were greeted with warm hugs by the ever smiling Marios - the proprietor of the hotel. Lithos is a family run hotel just outside the hustle and bustle of Mykonos town. There is a bus stop right outside the front door that runs half hourly during the peak season to nearby Ornos Beach or directly into the main town centre. The local beach of Agios Ioannis is just a short stroll away. Marios and Marina are the perfect hosts! Nothing is too much trouble for them. They are able to organise car hire directly to your door, restaurant bookings and transfers - anything to take the stress out of your holiday and allow you the time to relax and enjoy the beautiful pool area and take in the amazing views. We stayed in a Junior Suite - very spacious and spotlessly clean with 2 decks offering a beautiful panorama over the nearby beach.Lithos is a beautiful family run hotel and the excellent customer service has you returning again and again. Thank you Marios and Marina!   Room Tip: Junior Suites are spacious with amazing views. See more room tips",2
"We arrived to Mykonos by high speed ferry with no transportation arranged to get to our hotel. To my surprise, there's a gentleman holding a sign with my name on it in the parking lot. We greet him, he takes our luggage, we walk to his car. ""Did the travel agent arrange this?"" ""No. I'm the owner of the hotel. I wanted to come and get you.""Wouldn't even accept a tip.That is the level of service you recieve while staying at Lithos.Maurios (I hope I'm spelling his name right) and his wife and staff were absolutely amazing. Hands down the nicest guy I've ever met while traveling. The breakfast included in the room rate is really well rounded and delicious. Complimentary drinking water by the pool is such a nice touch, especially in the oppressvie heat. Hotel is modern in appearance in amenitites, very well maintained. Location is very close to town and beaches, and to be honest, no matter where you stay in Mykonos, you're going to need to rent a car if you want the full experience of everything the island has to offer. Free parking lot in the rear of the hotel. Pool and bar area is average, plenty of sun for tanning, nice view from the deck.The only negative is that the WiFi at the hotel sucks. Very weak inside the rooms. But you know, if you came to Mykonos to sit on your computer, I wouldn't want to travel with you anyway.....",0
"we were very happy staying here. Beautiful room, swimming pool to relax by and views to dream of later. The option of buying a nice salad by the pool or drinks was great. It's a little way out of town however the bus leaves from just outside. It was our first trip to Greece, we chose well.   Room Tip: We stayed in studio room which is a bit too close to bus stop. I'd pay more next time & get... See more room tips",1
We stayed at the Lithos with our two teenage sons for one night and wished we stayed longer. Such a lovely family run hotel opposite the beach. The owners really couldn't do enough to accommodate us and make us feel welcome. The room was immaculate and spotlessly clean. We really loved the pool area and their club sandwiches are to die for. We've stayed in many hotels and both my wife and I would recommend Lithos to anybody visiting Mykonos. We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we return to Mykonos.,2
"The property is very well maintained. we had opted for junior suite and it was excellent. It has sea facing view and close by beach on walking distance. The owners are extremely helpful. They helped us with the scooter booking, nearby restaurants, and also our return tickets from cruise to Athens. Perfect place for couples and family. It is not really near the city center but hey Mykonos is not that big either :P The breakfast served is good and healthy   Room Tip: The junior suite is excellent and economical See more room tips",1
"We just stayed at Lithos for two nights in July, and loved every minute of our stay. Marios and Marina are such welcoming hosts. From the second we walked in we were SO impressed as Marina sat us down and explained how to get around the island and recommended restaurants etc before showing us to our beautiful room. Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean and thoughtfully decorated and laid out. We had an amazing view from our private balcony, and Marios even dropped us a bottle of wine which was very much enjoyed! There is a stunning pool area, with bar, and took the opportunity to relax here as much as we could when not exploring Mykonos - enjoying yummy cocktails by the pool chatting and laughing with Marios who is someone who clearly loves this job. Breakfasts were delicious and plenty of food, and great coffee. There is a bus stop at the front of the hotel which makes it super easy to get into town, which is about 15 minutes away. We found Lithos to be in a much quieter area which we wanted and are so relieved we did not book somewhere right in Mykonos town. We looked forward to retreating back to our beautiful room or pool at the end of the day! We wish we had booked longer here, and so will be returning in 2016. I am hesistant to tell too many people how wonderful this hotel is as I hope we can get a booking when we next decide to visit! Thankyou so so much for making our stay in Mykonos amazing Marios and Marina. We look forward to seeing you next year hopefully!Carly and Emmanuel.   Room Tip: Definitely book a room with a balcony - you won't regret it. See more room tips",2
"As everyone else has stated this is a great place to stay. The owners could not be anymore hospitable and call it not a job but a 'way of life'!We had a studio apartment with a sea view and it was a glorious room with a great balcony. We asked for an umbrella to be brought up and this was done on the promise we wouldn't have it up when we were out - it can be quite windy! In hindsight sum sun loungers on the balcony would have made it even more perfect...The pool area was great with a 'limited' reasonable price food and drinks menu.The reason for not having 5 out of 5 are in some way not the owners fault. We enjoyed a previous week in the city and therefore had lots of tavernas etc to choose from. There were only 3 nearby and none of them were brilliant. There was a bus into town and although every 30 minutes, they were hardly ever on time and can get very busy in the evening. The town is only 15/20 minute journey (1.60 Euros each way) so it is accessible.But all in all a lovely place to stay and chill!",1
"Beautiful, although it was not in town, it was in a great location, on the quiet side of the island which i enjoyed, because you could actually relax! The hotel was run by lovely people that were always happy to help. One of my friends got sick while staying there, they called a doctor for us and after offered to drive us to the pharmacy at a late hour of the night to buy the perceptions! They were also very helpful with advice on where to go and what to do! The hotel was absolute luxury, it was amazing, especially after doing a tour around Europe in hostels, we really needed something of such high standards! Everything was amazing!",3
"I have stayed in some of the best luxury hotels in the world for leisure travel and I can honestly say that Lithos is my favourite hotel in the world.As this was our 3rd stay in the row here (for 6 days) and I have written previous reviews of which you can read, I will re-iterate on some of the major points on why this is a simply brilliant hotel.THE OWNERS: Marios and Marina are the kindest most generous people you will ever meet in the world of hotel hospitality. It is a family run business and this hotel was their dream of which after many years of hard work they made a reality. To one of the previous reviewers that made a rude comment about their son Spiros; that comment was truly uncalled for. To attack a 6 year old through an internet review is unprofessional and unkind. Spiros is a polite, spirited and happy young boy, who provides lots of laughs and makes you smile with his zest for life.PRE-ARRIVAL: Want to find out where to eat? Organise a hire car? Organise something special for your stay? Done. Just email Marios and Marina and the emails are replied to quickly and anything and everything can be organised for you.ARRIVAL: Our transfer was waiting for us at the port right on time (they have recently changed transfer companies as transfer companies and taxis can be an issue in Mykonos) and it was a short 10 min drive to the hotel.Refreshing drinks, happy faces and easy check in await us.ROOM: This year we had A superior studio sea view right in front of the pool. The rooms are huge by any countries standard and spotlessly clean (of which housekeeping take immense pride in this). A small kitchenette with utensils, gleaming bathroom, small dining table, comfortable sofa couch and balcony. The bed and linen are of a high standard and there are quite a few television stations (with good reception). The all important power outlets beside both sides of the bed and windows/doors that allow to be open slightly to let the fresh air in if you wish. Excellent air conditioning also.HOTEL FACILITIES: The pool/pool bar is the hub of the hotel with breakfast, drinks and snacks being served from early morning right through to past midnight (there is no closing time....just when the guests are happy!).The menu is simple but sufficient for your needs. Breakfast which is completely optional is savoury/sweet pastries, fresh meats and yoghurt, hard boiled eggs. It is fresh and delicious. Other items to eat which we enjoyed were the pita toasted sandwiches.Sit down by the pool or near the bar and immediatley be served a glass of cold water. Any type of drinks are available from freshly squeezed orange juice to the ever important delicious cocktails!The pool is spotlessly clean and fresh towels are right within reach. Plenty of comfortable sun lounges with little tables and umbrellas as well as bigger tables with comfy cushions. You will always have somewhere to sit.The hotel can also do your washing for you, which arrives back freshly folded and smells wonderful...at a very cheap price.GETTING AROUND: There is a bus stop right outside at the hotel which leaves/drops off on time, however we had Marios arrange a car for us which was 30 euro cheaper a day than what the hire companies were charging direct...great value and free parking at the back side of the hotel.NEARBY: There are 2 restaurants on the beach below as well as one 200 metres down the road. A small mini mart is handy should you want drinks for your fridge, snacks or suncreen etc.WIFI: The ever important free wifi is available at the hotel and guests should know the best and quickest place is near the pool bar. Mykonos as a whole (and even Santorini this year) had slower wifi than the previous year, however we are on an island and it cannot be helped. There is a sateillite dish and numerous routers around the hotel.To anyone that complains...this isn't Asia, so if downloading at highspeed is what you're interested in then don't go to the greek islands at all.RECOMMENDATIONS: Marios and Marina are honest in their recommendations on things to do and places to eat. They can arrange absolutely anything. This year we loved going to the open air cinema, Kostandidi restaurant (that do hotel pick up and drop off) in Ornos Beach and visiting Paradise and Super Paradise Beach. STAFF: Marios and Marina are joined by Petko (all round fantastic guy) and Dani and another lady. These are happy, hard working people who take pride in getting to know the guests, sharing stories, talking about life and having a laugh. They won't go to bed at night until the last guests have left the bar area and reception/phone is available 24 hours a day should you need anything.A dedicated family business who live and breathe hospitality. Don't even hesitate to stay here. (Book well in advance to ensure you get in).See you all next year!",9
We arrived at the Port in Mykonos and there was No driver to be seen.So that was a disappointment.We had to arrange own transport to get to the hotel.after the delays it was good to get to the hotel.Pool is very nice and you can get snacks around the pool.There is not much in the area of the hotel and you have to get a Bus 10 min ride to get into Mykonos Town.There is 3 resaraunts in the area and we only used Bellissimo as the food and service was great.Taxis to and from hotel are a pain as 2 times we asked to get a taxi and both times there was none available.On leaving we asked for a taxi to the port but there was none available and after waiting for a while i asked about a private transfer which came in 5-10 minutes.Not sure why that was not offered to us if they know that taxis are not reliable to the hotel.We did not eat Breakfast so can not comment on that.I got the impression they where not happy about us not having breakfast but the cost of 8.50 Euro x 3 for 4 mornings was not worth it.WIFI was ok but around Pool was very slow.,1
"This is a wonderful family owned hotel, run by a lovely couple Marios and Marina. Our stay was enjoyable, even though there were a few serious issues that the hotel will need to improve upon to maintain its #1 Mykonos Hotel status.The Good: Marios is an incredible host who speaks great English and can prepare all kinds of tasty food and drinks in his tiny pool bar; the room was huge and spacious and with all the amenities one could ever want on a Greek island; Breakfast and poll bar food was among the very best we've tasted in Greece which is a great achievement considering they only have a pool bar and not a proper restaurantThe bad: The transfer company the hotel uses is unreliable to say the least - we had scheduled a transfer, but no one showed up at the port to take us to the hotel, so after 20 minutes of waiting we had to take a couple of buses and arrived to hotel 3 hours later than planned; a few days later the return transfer was 10 minutes late and the driver drove extremely fast and dangerously; the owner's spoiled noisy son has occupied the entire pool for the whole afternoon on the day we decided to lounge on the pool terrace; Marios an his staff at the pool bar smoked continuously while on the job, with the cigarette smoke being blown among the guests around the pool - it's the first and only time anywhere in the world that I've seen hotel staff smoke while on duty; the shampoo in the bathroom has caused me a terrible dandruff problem that I needed several weeks to get rid off - I've never had dandruff problems before in my life and I always use hotel shampoo.Bottom line - this is indeed a wonderful hotel with great hosts and amazing food (I wish they had a proper restaurant), but for us to return they will have to polish up some aspects of their service as described above.   Room Tip: Had the downstairs room with a window to the bus station, so some noise could be heard from the stre... See more room tips",3
"Stayed at this hotel in July for 4 nights. Lovely Hotel But You need to be aware that it is quite remote from the Mykonos Town and Its about 20 minutes by taxi from the port. Had a little mix up with arrivals after organising a pick up from the hotel had to wait quite a while for a taxi that we had to organise ourselves as taxis are not readily available in Mykonos. Hotel is Nice, with modern facilities we didn't have the breakfast as we aren't breakfast people so can't comment on the that. The bus stop is directly outside the hotel but you need to be aware that there isn't many restaurants to visit around the area. There is 2 restaurants directly on the beach and one about 2 minutes walk down the road which was called Bellissimo we ate there most nights as sometimes the bus can be very crowded and hot . Pool facilities are nice you can order snacks around the pool if you feel like it. Keep in mind when you need to organise a transfer back to the port or Airport when leaving be prepared to wait as once again taxis aren't readily available. Wish we got offered tranfers at the start we were waiting a while.",0
"The Lithos Hotel in Mykonos has a lot to offer. The accommodation modern and clean and is extremely comfortable. The management and team are fantastic. They are extremely efficient and at the same time very laid back, making for a very relaxing stay. The facilities are fantastic and the resort is located on the quieter side of town so you can get away from the hustle and bustle of Mykonos and also escape the sometimes high prices of parts of Mykonos. This is the best value breakfast in town, overlooking extensive views of the ocean. Marina and Mario are wonderful hosts. So helpful with everything we wanted to see and do.   Room Tip: Great ocean views from clean modern rooms. It is also great to come home to air conditioning and ext... See more room tips",2
"A simply wonderful hotel in Mykonos. I wouldn't recommend any other place to stay in Mykonos. The hosts, Marios and Marina are simply amazing and did everything they can to make our trip the best trip ever. The hotel is brand new and spotless and the morning breakfast is delicious with wonderful sea views. The bus stop is right outside the hotel and provides easy access to the town. If you go to Mykonos, don't waste time researching other hotels and just book this one!",1
"The excellent service and friendliness of Marios, Marina and Pedko are the best we've ever experienced. The hotel is spotless and is in a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of some resorts. If you're looking for a relaxing holiday in a beautiful boutique hotel, then this is the place for you.",2
We stayed here for four nights and it was the best four nights of my life. The hotel is amazing and is in a great location but not just that the owners are the most beautiful and kind hearted people I've ever met! You honestly get the most beautiful view from the hotel and it has great bar snacks I will definitely be coming back to this hotel for sure.,2
We enjoyed our stay here. We stayed in a superior sea view room. This had a separate bedroom and 2 bathrooms and a fold out large bed that our 21yr old daughter slept on. Lovely view of the sea and pool area. Rooms spotlessly cleaned and had cooking facilities if you wished to cook. Beautiful beach down the hill Agios loannis which was where they filmed the Shirley valentine movie. We spend the day and we hired chairs at hippy fish and stayed on the beach most of the day and enjoyed food and drinks there. The water so clear and lovely to swim in. It's a bit of a walk back up the hill but we enjoyed the exercise. We also walked a couple of times in to Ornos which took about 15mins on the road. Lots of lovely beachside restaurants there and we caught the water taxi over to the other beaches from here. Definitely a lovely way to see the different beaches and admire some of the properties from the water. It cost about 10euro with stops at 2 different beaches and return back. Caught the bus in to town which was easy as it left right out the front of the hotel. We loved this area to stay in as it's quiet and quaint compared to some of the other busy beachside areas. The owners marios and Marina made us feel really welcome. Beautiful breakfast and good coffee served by the pool each morning. Spending nights chatting to Marios and his lovely workers was always a treat on returning to the hotel as we would always end the night with a drink by the pool. Marios knowing our order and always a glass of cold water given as well. . We felt like they were our friends. Definitely a gem of a hotel which is very reasonably priced for the quality of this place. Definitely would stay here again if we come back one day to Mykonos.   Room Tip: Sea view rooms would be better See more room tips,1
"We booked a superior sea view suite and it was very spacious, comfortable and spotless and great for a few days of poolside relaxation. The owners and staff were very friendly and we spent a very relaxing quiet week catching up on some reading and rest.Anyone with mobility issues should know that it is a very steep walk to and from the beach and although we relied on the local bus to get around (bus stop directly out the front) I would only stay here again if we hired a car as it was a bit too far from everything and the buses were invariably late & crowded and we spent quite a bit of time waiting around.Overall it was a nice, new, small hotel with good owners & staff that was quiet and reasonably priced.",0
"The hotel was beyond our expectations. The staff is amazing. Marina helped us with everything! The rooms are very nice and spacious, loved the decor and the atmosphere. The bus stop was located just outside the hotel and that is a BIG plus as you can take the bus nearly anywhere on the island. The hotel has a lovely pool and terrace.",0
"This was our first time to Mykonos. How lucky that we found Lithos by Spyros & Flora! (Thank you TripAdvisor!!!) The hotel is located in Agios Ioannis, a convenient and beautiful location. From the hotel, you can see Delos and Paros. It is very easy to get to town (we used the public buses), but it is also far enough away to have some calm when you want it.Even before we arrived, Marios and Marina made us feel welcome. They arranged for a transfer from the airport. They booked us in a terrific restaurant at Ornos Beach for our first night and they asked the restaurant to pick us up and take us back! They provided us with very helpful information about going to visit Delos.Because of their help via email, when we arrived at the hotel, I felt that we already knew each other. What a great--and personal--start to our stay in Greece!The hotel? It's gorgeous. Our room was very large, extremely clean, and well appointed. It had a small kitchen, and quite a nice bathroom. Breakfast is served on an attractive patio, between the pool and the incredible views of the Aegean. And the food was copious and tasty. We also spent the late afternoons poolside, enjoying the delicious and reasonably priced cocktails.We only stayed for two nights. I am quite sure, however, that we'll be back to Mykonos, if only to return to this hotel. As the French would say, the ""rapport qualite-prix"" is excellent.",1
"We stayed at the Lithos for four nights in June. We were amazed at the hospitality of our hosts Marios and Marina, and the loveliness of their hotel. It was perfect. Away from the hustle and bustle of Mykonos Town on a quiet road within a short walk to the beach. The room was always spotless. The pool area was amazing with a nice bar area and view of the sea and Delos in the distance. Breakfast was always delicious. I could go on and on. We felt like we were leaving family when we left...and that was after only four days. We will definitely be back...and we will most definitely recommend this hotel to all our friends",0
"My friend and I spent our first days on the Greek Islands at this wonderful boutique hotel, and what a great start it was. The whole place was spotless and it is obvious that the owners Marios and Marina take great pride in their hotel. From the minute we arrived until we left we felt totally comfortable, nothing was too much trouble. Wonderful experience, I can't recommend highly enough this beautiful, classy place. Thank you so much to all staff at Lithos by Spyros and Flora. I wish I had a few more evenings having a quiet wine by the pool listening to Marios' stories. P.S. A kiss for Bob.Catherine",1
"Room was spotless, large and beautiful - only 5 minute walk to beach and the bus to town stops right in front. Marina was a lovely hostess and offered key advice as to what to see upon our arrival. The rooftop pool and bar are lovely as well. Had a great time and wish all well.",0
"This was our second visit to Lithos and once again we were blown away by not only this wonderful hotel but the amazing hospitality of Marios and Marina. I have reviewed before and stand by everything I said then, and can only add that this is my first time back to the same hotel and if anything it was even better. From the moment you arrive you will feel the tension slip away and you can simply enjoy a relaxing stay by the pool or visit the rest of the island and come back to this oasis in the evening. You will be well looked after and you will want for nothing. Thank you Marios and Marina for everything and we can't wait to come back to see you and the family and enjoy your amazing hotel soon.   Room Tip: All the rooms are decorated to a very high standard and have excellent facilities but the sea view i... See more room tips",1
"We absolutely loved our time in Mykonos at Lithos by Spyros & Flora. From the get go, both Marios & Flora were extremely helpful & informative about the area & things to do. The rooms were HUGE, with large beds, full kitchen & large bathroom. The pool was great with a large area to sunbake, which overlooked the beautiful water below. In terms of location, it is slightly out of Mykonos town (this wasn't a bad thing), but only a 5 minute bus ride away. If we go back to Mykonos, I wouldn't book anywhere else.",0
"Mario and Marina, are the hard working hosts of this lovely family hotel. Spending 5 days there and we felt like a part of this family. the hotel is meticulously clean, the room comfy, the location appropriately quiet after rushing around the beautiful hectic island of Mykonos. Lovely breakfast where you get to meet and talk to all the guests by the pool. Lithos is a hotel we would highly recommend.",0
"Rooms are really nicely decorated and feel cool in the heat. Plenty of kitchen utensils etc. if you wanted to make breakfast/lunch for yourself. Great value to get a room a balcony and views of the sea if you can. Also appreciated the cute pool and poolside bar, plus shaded areas to eat/sit if you want to keep cool during the day. Nice breezes coming off the sea. Location is good (bus stop outside hotel) and two minutes walk down to the bay and Hippy Fish restaurant (great fish if a little pricey).Only annoyance was the transportation company they use and collections from airport (1st time) and port (2nd). First time we were forgotten at the airport and were the last people to leave. Not a great start as it was dark! Second time, was from the port - we were supposed to be met by the driver carrying a sign, but we couldn't find him. Only after calling Marina did he come to find us. Goodness knows how else we could have found him as he was parked quite far away. Would recommend the hotel, however.

"This hotel was exactly what we were looking for.... human size, beautiful view on Mykonos town, typical Cyclade architecture, lovely and professional staff ( helpful, dedicated to their client, they bring you into town or wherever at anytime.... they did their best to make our stay so confortable and so sweet....once again thanks to the team....Sotiris, Irene, George by 3 !, Panagiotis ...

"The hotel is perfect ! modern clean design , comfortable beds . The pool area is amazing , staff is warm and friendly and makes you feel like family all along ! There is a small gym to work out . The views are simply beautiful . It's very quiet and relaxing . However you will probably need a car to get around , but rental cars are cheap and it's very uncomplicated - reception organized everything for us . Thanks for an amazing week , we truly had a great time . Steven & Chet",0
"The service and the professionalism of the Princess staff is indeed exceptional. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Princess, thank you for taking good care of us; you made our trip extra special. We would definitely recommend the Princess Hotel to our friends.The Abukishk family.   Room Tip: Upstaris rooms have wonderful panoramic view. See more room tips",1
"Staying at the Mykonos Princess was truly relaxing from beginning to end. The facility itself is clean and beautiful. The view of the ocean and mountains is spectacular. We stayed in 3 rooms because we were traveling with our family, and each room had a picture perfect view. The staff was amazing! They were warm, welcoming, and extremely helpful. The gym was a big plus. A poolside bar was a nice feature for a beverage at any time. The service and food at breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed ordering from a menu and being served. They had gluten free options, and such a delicious variety of items presented in an appetizing manner. The hotel transportation system made visiting the special places on the island easy. We felt very pampered here. If you are traveling to Mykonos book this hotel right away.   Room Tip: The balcony rooms are preferable if you like privacy. See more room tips",0
"I reserved this hotel many months before we were due to travel and studied reviews, instagram, Facebook and anything else i could find before finally committing about a month before we actually went. So my expectations were high but I did not actually think it would be this close to perfection. We stayed for 2 weeks at the end of July/ beginning of August in a deluxe suite with a sea view. The trip from the airport was in a smart Mercedes with a friendly professional driver and took just 10 minutes, hassle free. Our reception was warm and relaxed and set the tone for our stay. A cool drink and soothing cool towel and a personal tour of the facilities which was quick and informative. Then we were shown to our room. Two large rooms and a bathroom, chic, smart and peaceful. decor white and grey. Spotlessly clean. Nice quality furnishings. Fantastic huge mirror a large sofa bed and table and chairs in the living area with a patio area outside with comfortable chairs and a table too. The bed was very large and very comfortable, a choice of pillows and a dressing table/desk area and chair, chest of drawers and 2 bedside tables. A walk in cupboard as a wardrobe with a safe. (not too much hanging space and we take a lot of clothes so kept most in our cases). The bathroom was modern with a walk in shower (there was room for a bath so that would be a great addition). All toiletries provided and towels changes twice daily if required although the hotel has a green policy so encourages you to reuse if possible.(no pressure though) We had a complimentary sparkling rose waiting in an ice bucket and some water and sweet treats. Such lovely personal touches that continue throughout your stay. Every night with turndown you have free water, a treat and a 'happy message' printed on a card and the weather forecast delivered to your room. All with a smile and a chat from Anna.The Gym whilst smallish is well equipped and never too busy , towels and water are available. My partner used it every day and had no complaints and i was concerned before we went in case it was too small as i could not find out very much about it but it was definitely not a problem and just a few steps down from our suite so almost like having a gym in the cellar of your house!The wifi in the hotel is free and generally ok apart from our room where it was intermittent which was probably our only gripe as there are not a huge selection of tv channels and not being able to stream on the mac or iPad was disappointing. We managed to live without it in the end but it would have been good to get it. I was able to do emails and browse generally though.The exterior areas are spotlessly clean and maintained. The pool is not huge but was never full and was beautiful. The sunbeds are clean and comfortable and clean towels are provided folded ready for you. You never have to reserve a bed and once you move new towels are replaced ready for the next person. Fresh iced water is provided to your bed throughout the day and free shots of juice/mini cocktail tasters too and cooled soothing towels for you too. All delivered with a smile. The staff are absolutely delightful - friendly, responsive and fun. There is a great vibe and music played that is not intrusive but means there is a good atmosphere.The food was impeccable with breakfast being an event for us ;), we tried most things on the menu and were never disappointed - usually on the same day.The evening meals were top class, delicious and well presented. We met the chef who obviously takes pride in his work. The trip to town takes about 10/15 mins and the hotel will happily take you (for a small charge by Mykonos standards!) and they run a shuttle from 7 at night hourly if required anyway. It wasn't really suitable to walk though as the road is busy and winds round the hills with no pavement. I did think when i booked we would walk sometimes but I doubt anyone would. The beach is 3 mins down the hill and is smallish but sandy and beautiful clear waters. Generally it is well sheltered from the winds that the island is famous for but the cruise ships that stop at the nearby harbour can sometimes cause a few unexpected waves so thats worth noting if you have children. Definitely a family friendly beach. It has sunbeds for hire and 3 restaurants immediately behind all of which sell decent food at reasonable prices. A few minutes further along there is an Irish bar, italian restaurant and a small supermarket so everything you need. Every day though at some point day or evening we went into the town which is gorgeous. So unique in style and fabulous shops (we are shopping addicts!) with high end shops, bars, restaurants and clubs as well as local goods and touristy things. I never got bored of this, there are no cars and you can just wander through the small streets and browse to your hearts content. We did not have a bad meal in two weeks but be warned this place is not cheap!!! so be prepared to spend a lot of money!We also visited Rakken Beach Club which is about half an hour from the hotel and is one of a number of similar places on the island. It was cool, great vibe, music, mixed age groups, beautiful beach but the sunbeds were 40/50 euros at least so be prepared!I could write so much about this island and our holiday but hopefully this is enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. I would recommend this hotel unreservedly and hope that you choose it and enjoy it as much as we did.",3
"We loved our stay at the Princess Mykonos, very classy small hotel with 5 star service.From the greeting, welcome drink, tour, and amazing service, all through our two night stay, we only wish we could have stayed longer as everything was perfect. I will be recommending this wonderful accommodation for a long time. Thank you Princess team.   Room Tip: Sea view only way to go. See more room tips",0
"We visited Mykonos Princess hotel in July 2016. Upon arrival the welcome was fabulous Cleopatra came out to meet us from the taxi, our cases were whisked away and we were offered a welcome drink and then a tour of the hotel. The rooms are lovely, fresh and clean with all necessary facilities and a nice view from our balcony. We spent a lot of time at the hotel as we wanted complete rest and relaxation and you couldn't ask for a better place to do that. All the staff were amazing their service and attention to detail is second to none. Nothing was too much trouble, they actually enjoyed their jobs and the customer service they provided was first class! I would say the staff made our holiday a wonderful experience.The food is lovely and breakfast is so well presented with lots of choices and amazing views across the ocean to Mykonos old town.The bus shuttle service from the hotel is a brilliant service allowing you easy access to Mykonos town. The beach is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel which hosts a number of restaurants and tavernas.We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, Irene and the team provide superb service in a beautiful, tranquil hotel.Thank you for making our holiday so special.

"Stayed here for 4 nights in July. We stayed 2 nights in the Classic Room with Sea View then 2 nights in the Junior Suite Sea View. The Classic Room was small but well appointed. The Junior Suite was considerably bigger with a large sitting area. On our arrival they had iced water, grapes and sweets waiting in our room which was a nice touch. This hotel also had the cheapest mini-bar in all of the places we stayed in Europe!The staff at this hotel were super helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is beautifully designed and the decor is calm, clean and luxurious feeling. The pool was stunning - we intended on visiting nearby beaches but instead ended up by the pool most days as it was too beautiful to leave! The cocktail menu was also great - had the best grapefruit cocktails by the pool! Breakfast was included with out booking and they had a great range of food including greek cuisine. The hotel offered a free return shuttle to Mykonos Town each night from 7pm-11pm which made the trip to town easy. Mykonos Princess is quite close the Mykonos Town but due to the nature of the roads it's not really a walkable distance. They also had a car service available at an extra cost 24/7 if you needed. Will stay here again when I next visit Mykonos.   Room Tip: Junior Suite with Sea View was a great choice. Nice and spacious. See more room tips",0
"On arrival the welcome by the staff was excellent, with a short guided tour of the available facilites, the room had all of the facilties you would want as would all of the others from seeing my daughters seperate room. All of the reception, bar and restuarant staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful with advice on beaches and transport, there are only 34 cabs on the island so you need to make use of the hotel shuttle service to and from Mykonos town, 10 Euros per room per journey. The beach, which is sandy and fairly quiet and is only a 5 minute walk down a hill with some good tavernas, Epistroffe being one of them, the hotel restuarant food is of good quality and flavour in a relaxed and nice environment, plenty of choice for breakfast from eggs anyway you like to Greek yoghurt and honey. We had one problem with a bathroom light which was rectified within 10 minutes of reporting it. After spending years of doing villa holidays this is the way to go for a relaxed holiday, felt no need to hire a car but just to relax between the hotel and the beach, would certainly return.

The hotel is beautifully decorated with amazing view overlooking the sea. The room was spacious with a private balcony. Very tranquil atmosphere. High quality breakfast, lunch and dinner. The perfect hotel experience at Mykonos.",0
"In an elevated location two minutes walk from Agios Stefanos beach, the Mykonos Princess has glorious views across the bay to Mykonos old town and the cruise ships that come and go.The hotel itself is gorgeous. A cool, minimal style, it is a haven of tranquility.The staff? They simply cannot be praised highly enough. Irene's team, from the front desk, to restaurant, bar and support staff could not do anything more to make our stay perfect. Nothing was too much trouble.Anna, Maria and Debbie in the restaurant are absolute sweethearts, not forgetting the boys, Petros, Soteris and Panos, along with the two Georges looking after the bar, and Joanne and Cleaopatra in reception. I know there are more so apologies to those who I have missed.There is a shuttle service both day and night into town, which is a 5 minute ride. You would not want to walk, as the road is narrow, busy and hilly.Our only minor suggestion would be to maybe offer a more simple or varied menu in the evening, as sometimes, you just want a light bite. But this really is a minor comment and we had a wonderfully relaxing ten days.Thank you. Kind regards, Alasdair & Louise.   Room Tip: A sea view is wonderful to wake up to.

Irene was lovely as was one of the pool attendant girls who made me detox waters complimentary when I lay by the pool.*The glorious pool with comfy sun loungers*The gym on site, quite well equipped and spacious for a hotel gym (had free weights as well cardio machines)*The daily complimentary treats by the pool and sweet little notes with temperature for the next day *The complimentary upgrades. In fact we were upgraded to the amazing grand suite on our last night and had already been upgraded to a junior suite. *Extensive al la carte breakfast options including a super healthy egg white omlette! Our only (but well resolved) issue with the place was on a arrival for a first night they had double booked our room and had to put us up in another hotel. The manager came to meet us a port to explain and apologise, and they went above and beyond to make it up to us while we stayed. I think it was a mistake made and he staff felt very bad and concerned for us. But it all worked out in the end and we were not mad about it. One thing that we said on the feedback form was they needed to rotate their poolside music playlist more frequently.... I think the same 15 or so songs played repeatedly all day... It's ok it was good music but that would improve the experience even more. I would highly recommend this hotel to others, it has a cool modern vibe but is not pretentious. The staff are all you and professional with amazing English too. I hope to return one day.",1
"This is a fabulous place. It starts with the warm welcome on arrival and the more of the team you meet the better it gets. The rooms are spacious and comfortable although the pebble/stone floor means the slippers provided are useful. A daily turn-down service offered is a nice touch. The pool has 9-10 double sun beds so can get busy at times. Water is provided free through out the day along with cool towels, drinks and snacks. Breakfast is great, with a good selection to choose from ( and you can order as little or as much as you want) and it is served to your table. A free shuttle bus runs hourly from 7-11pm into/from the Old Town (ten minutes away). Reception will organise trips and transport around the island. There is a beach 5 minutes walk away with a number of restaurants. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. Their friendly and helpful attitude turn this from a good place to an excellent place. Would definitely recommend staying here.",0
"Everything at this hotel was lovely! The view, the amazing welcoming staff, the rooms were clean, modern, chic and over all relaxing, plus the hotel offers an evening turn down service. The hotel pool was small yet comfortable with sun lounger beds and umbrellas upon request. Lovely breakfast every morning with a selection of hot and cold options. The staff were amazing throughout and would endeavour to meet your every need. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to the town which runs every hour from 8pm - 11pm. Agios Stefanos beach is a short walk away and has a handful of beach restaurants to choose from. Upon departure the hotel were unable to offer us late checkout however they did offer us another room within the hotel which we were able to use to freshen ourselves up free of charge.",0
"Having just returned from vacation in Greece (Athens, Mykonos, Santorini), all I can think about is Mykonos Princess. Forget all the usual stuff-gorgeous locations, top notch amenities, great decor-all that is easily found in Mykonos. What really blew us away was the staff-a team of about 10-13 people who all knew you by name and made sure that you were comfortable, taken care of during the entire stay. From the easy, no pressure check in, to the friendly and knowledgeable restaurant staff, to the waitress at the pool who was making sure everyone was hydrated and comfortable at all times--the staff at Mykonos Princess is top notch that I can say is easily the best service in the world. Would recommend this hotel to anyone!!!",0
"Junior suites sea view do not all have breathtaking sea view as said by website.We got one with small window and wall view (but they said it was a quiet one, just like we asked for).After arguing, we finally got a discount on the first night, and an ""upgrade"" to a breathtaking sea view suite over the noisy pool.Thanks for the arrangement, but not for the stress.We will not come back there.By the way, we would recommend it for this breathtaking sea view over the bay of Mykonos town, for the excellent service staff (special award to Anna), for the good and fine food (congratulations to the chef), provided that you like loud music around the pool, at the restaurant, and up to your balcony.",0
"The hotel sets high expectations and exceeds them in all areas! Service, accommodations and staff will exceed all your needs. The pool is very inviting but a local organized beach is a quick walk. Local taverns are in walking distance. The hotel staff is accommodating on providing shuttle services throughout the island.   Room Tip: Beautiful view of the sea. See more room tips",0
"Mykonos Princess was amazing. The best hotel and staff we have ever encountered on any vacation. There was never a time that we didn't feel appreciated, waiting on us hand and foot. They made our honeymoon an unforgettable one and we cannot wait to come back in the future.",0
"I spent 3 nights here and didn't want to leave! The location is perfect because it's just quiet enough, with great views and the staff includes a personal driver to take you into town for shopping, dinner, or to other beaches. You can walk to one of the more quiet beaches on Mykonos, which also has 4-5 nice outdoor cafes. The rooms are clean and modern, and the drinks at the pool bar are excellent!",0
"Everything was just perfect! Location is in really nice and quiet part of Mykonos, with great view and really calming down allowing to relax and forget about everyday problems. Personel was absolutely perfect and really making feeling like we are friends knowing each other for a long time.",0
"We spent five nights here and overall it was really enjoyable. Large room, modern and very comfortable - maybe not enough space for clothes storage. Pool area and views were just excellent.Liked the location as it was just out if Mykonos town so was a lot quieter but hotel shuttle made it very easy to get into town. Breakfasts were good though service was slow at times.Staff were very friendly and helpful and generally cared about ensuring we had a good time.",0
"Our time at Mykonos Princess Hotel was wonderful! The location is perfect for those wanting to be slightly away from the city scene. The staff at the hotel were amazing - very sweet, attentive, and fun! Our room was great - very romantic and they left us a bottle of champagne the day we got there. They also constantly provided us with bottled water which was great and unlike any other hotels in Greece that we stayed at. The pool was great and had a great view from it. The breakfast and lunch menus were great.Also, the beach is a 5 min walk from the hotel and the water and sand are lovely. Loved this hotel! It was our favorite during out trip to Greece!",0
"Amazing chic and modern hotel, purely Greek style in a quiet area with spectacular view not far from the city centre, with really great staff members. Thank you all for your welcoming smile and kindness! A special thank to Cleopatra, Panos, Georges, Demi. Apologies if your names are not written correctly See U soon ! Jean-Charles",1
Grate location for family that like calm place The beach is grate Hotel grate ! Staff is more than grate ! Service grate. We will really recommend this place They have transportation service to the city for free VIP Breakfast is amazing best selection service and food quality We really recommend this place,0
"The hotel was absolutely fantastic, the rooms were very clean and well decorated, great views the piscine was wonderfull and the view of city magnificent its 15 min away from the center so need to have car",0
"On a trip to celebrate a milestone birthday my visit to the Mykonos Princess was magical. This place is a little slice of heaven on earth. What I expected was beautiful scenery, lovely weather and relaxation. What I got was so much more. The team at the Mykonos make you feel like family from the moment you arrive. I cannot say enough about how wonderful everyone is here - just genuine, kind, fun and tremendously hard working people. One other review summarized it so well, the Mykonos hotel is a very good hotel made great by the people who work there. Ef Charisto Mykonos Princess...xoxo, Meg DiMascio",0
"Myself and 27 others stayed at the Mykonos Princess Hotel as guests at our friends wedding which took place during our weeks holiday. The hotel was absolutely fantastic, the rooms were very clean and well decorated, great views - ours being particularly spectacular. The staff were extremely polite and attentive, bringing cold towels, ice water and occasional fruity drinks, cocktails, shots around the pool for the guests to try. We were also visited by the staff each evening, presented with bottles of water, sweets, and one evening a bracelet, along with the weather report for the following day. We were never left wanting and the hotel seemed to run very efficiently, the team were always kind and dressed very smartly.Breakfast was included which was made to order, it was fresh and piping hot!Location wise it isn't in the town but a short taxi ride away, the free shuttle bus is fantastic but for a group as large as ours 8 people at a time & only 1 bus each hour it didn't always work out..... Also the busses are only free from 7pm-11.15pm. Perhaps those hours should be longer. Very clean pool and surrounding areas, sunbeds were lovely and comfy and umbrellas were available upon request. Beautiful views of the harbour and the incoming cruise ships each day. Food and drink in the hotel were quite expensive, but that seemed to be the general feel to the whole of Mykonos, never have I seen cocktails at at least £15 each!! - That's probably my only criticism of the entire week. But the hotel as a whole is fab, very friendly and welcoming and deserves the 5 star rating it has. I have 100% recommended it to friends and family.   Room Tip: Our room was towards the back of the hotel, it was quiet and we had our own terrace we sat on &amp... See more room tips",0
"We stayed in Mykonos Princess this month and we were so happy for our choice! The location was incredible, the room clean and comfortable, the food unforgetable and the personel so helpful, plesant and always with a big smile! Great job guys! Can't wait to see you again this August!",0
"We booked this hotel on our way out of Mykonos - prior to the Mykonos Princess we stayed with our extended family at a private villa and honestly this hotel would have been better ! The rooms are clean, modern and have stunning views. The best part was their included breakfast which was not just some buffet of soggy eggs - but a made to order delicious experience including freshly squeezed OJ, wonderfully omelettes and Greek salad. The hotel is very close to a beach and their pool has a relaxed vibeI will be sure to come back to this wonderful hotel with unbelievable hospitality the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of :)",0
Great surprise. Amazing service. Great choice of food for breakfast from healthy to greek style dishes. Clean room. Modern style and just renovated room. Great pool service. Friendly and young personel. 15min by car to any great and trendy beach in Mykonos. 10 min from the airport. 8 minutes by car to the Mykonos center.,1
"My best friend and I stayed at the Mykonos Princess Hotel during the first week of June and we are still blown away by this amazing hotel and more importantly the outstanding staff, service and guest treatment - we really felt like princesses! The premises of the hotel are gorgeous, clean and the views are breathtaking. Even though we didn't spend much time at our hotel room we definitely loved coming back ""home"" as the rooms were super stylish and the beds were extremely comfy. Each room has a littly balcony or terrace and from almost all rooms you can see the ocean. The pool area was amazing - super chill, relaxing music, not too crowded, sunbeds were comfy and service was awesome. Thermalwater, refreshing towels and water as much as we liked. The staff was super attentive and anticipated our every wishes. Needless to say that food & drinks at the hotel were very good as well. On the first day we had dinner at the hotel and it was one of the best food experiences I've had during my stay. The free breakfast is very good as well - small portions but you can order as much as you like. Overall, the staff really made our holiday. It felt like having a chat with friends and their kindness was neither fake nor forced in any way. We loved hanging out at the bar after dinner. The trip wouldn't have been as amazing as it was without the help and recommendation of the hotel staff giving us valuable restaurant and beach recommendations. We made us of the free shuttle to town every day which returns a bit early at 11:15 but during the first week of June we didn't have any difficulties getting a taxi later at night. We also used the private shuttle for our day trips which was comfortable but maybe also a bit expensive with 30€ per way. Overall, I can say that we are already missing this place so much - there's nothing like it when it comes to atmosphere, vibe, style and staff! We are definitely coming back and will be gushing about this place for a long time to come.   Room Tip: Rooms on the upper floors have a nice view! See more room tips",2
"We were on our honeymoon 3 weeks ago. Stuff was extremely kind and friendly.  The room was comfort, very clean and well designed, as well as the hotel itself.Breakfast is great and very tasty!!.Wi-fi was very low in the room and worked only from the pool area",0
"We came on holiday to this hotel as a couple with a baby. The service was amazing, the staff were so friendly and amazing also. Our baby turned 1 years old and they even made her a cake for the occasion. Organised by the young girl with glasses who always fussed over our little girl. Defiantly 5* and above I'd even say! Just luxury!",0
"Me and my partner have just returned from possibly one of the greatest weeks holiday we have ever had. I can say proudly that The Princess Mykonos played a huge part in this. Timos gave a great first impression when meeting us at the airport for our transfer, giving us water and talking us through the island. The check in process is lovely, and really sets the tone of the place. Very relaxed and you are greeted with a nice cool glass of local fizz. Not the nicest but nice enough! We were then shown round by the endearing Gianna who talked us through the hotel and showed us round the facilities. She also answered any question we could think of as well as recommending some great restaurants and beaches for us to visit. We were upgraded to a suite, which was lovely, it didn't have the best view but it didn't matter. The room was big, clean and beautifully furnished. A few bits of the room could do with a tighten up and polish, but you wouldn't really notice unless you were really looking. The bed was very comfortable and had plenty of pillows (they also have a pillow menu, we didn't try any different ones, but a nice touch non the less). In the bathroom were good quality toiletries as well that were diligently replaced each morning. The whole week was a dream, breakfast is a lovely affair, again relaxed and you can pick anything off their menu, hot & cold, healthy and not so healthy. So a good mix, and the quality of ingredients was high. A small suggestion would be a juice selection to choose from, not that the fresh orange juice wasn't delicious on its own. Breakfast also runs until 11.30 which we liked, as some places only go to 10am which on holiday can seem a tad early if you are wanting to sleep in. The pool is beautiful, and has a relaxed atmosphere that allows you to quickly unwind into holiday mode. The big double sun beds I liked a lot, more romantic than the normal singles. The pool staff keep you topped up with fresh iced water and come round with different treats throughout the day. The iced chocolate coffee was my favourite. The shuttle service into town is painless and very handy, we used it every night to get into town and most nights to return. it runs to 11.15pm, which whilst late enough for most, it would be even better if it ran later, as the town only gets going around that time. Of course you can take a taxi but they are few and far between. Finally they were very sweet on my partners birthday and played music at breakfast and presented us a with a nice bottle of prosecco to enjoy, again thoughtful and fun. What we loved most about this beautiful hotel were the staff. They take their jobs seriously, but have that relaxed approachability that only the best hotels I have stayed in achieve. Keep that up and you will become renowned for it. Everyone from breakfast, Petros and the girls, to the barman, George and manager Satiris were fantastic. Me and my partner also fell in love with Cleopatra and Gianna, they are so charming and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and they really help set that tone of 5 star that they now proudly have. Thank you for the best week. We will be back next year and have been telling everyone how fantastic it was. What a dream!   Room Tip: Try and get a room on the top level rather than ground floor for a completely uninterrupted view out... See more room tips",1
"Great location and views; friendly attentive staff; comfortable double sunbeds round the pool (thick mattresses on wooden frames, not the usual white plastic instruments of torture); simple but clean and pleasant rooms; free shuttle bus to town. The sting of the expensive bar prices (9 Euros each on average) somewhat assuaged by the constant iced water, soft drink cocktails and occasional hard drink cocktails dispensed around the pool. Seems almost churlish to object to the plink-plonky elevator music piped around the pool most of the time: so nice when it stopped(yes, we spent a lot of time round the pool). Definitely going back though. Loved it!   Room Tip: They're all good, as far as I could see. See more room tips",0
"What can I say, just spent 5 days here. The best service I've ever experienced. The hotel is lovely, great location, just a short shuttle ride into Mykanos town, but it's the staff that make this hotel so special. Nothing was too much trouble. So attentive. The breakfast choice was lovely, All freshly cooked, not buffet style. I would so highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to visit again.   Room Tip: We had the deluxe suite.. was amazing, had a separate place to subathe. Very chilled See more room tips",1
"We've been to Mykonos twice before and loved it but this time we wanted to try a different hotel for a change. We're so glad we chose the Mykonos Princess. Arriving from a very early flight from the UK we realised we'd left London with no currency and couldn't get any at the airport to get a taxi. We called the hotel and they immediately sent their (lovely) driver to collect us, who arrived within less than 10 minutes, diffusing an extremely stressful situation very calmly. The hotel itself is beautiful and perfectly-located and the staff are fantastic - they genuinely seem to care about their guests having a really good time and take time to make sure everything is perfect. The breakfast deserves a mention as it's a fantastic a la carte menu and the choice is wonderful with lots of Greek specialities among it. The hotel is great at judging the little extras that make your stay even better - from iced towels and special drinks around the pool, to throwing in an amazing pudding after a really lovely dinner on the terrace at the hotel's restaurant. It was our wedding anniversary during our stay and the staff went out of their way to make us feel special and look after us. We were really very sad to leave and hope to return one day.   Room Tip: We had a standard double room and it was lovely. I'd imagine all rooms are very nice See more room tips",1
"This was the perfect hotel for us in Mykonos. It was so pretty. The staff was very, very helpful and attentive. I would highly recommend it. Breakfasts were great and included with the room. Staff have great recommendations on beaches and things to do. Wouldn't want to stay anyplace else in Mykonos!",2
"Just returned from a fabulous stay at the Princess hotel Mykonos! Staff were attentive and very friendly which is a great combination. We were not completely happy with our room (junior suite) on arrival due to no sea-view and slightly dated bath/shower combination, but after a short chat with management we were moved on the second day to a wonderful spacious, tastefully fitted room that satisfied us enormously. Would definitely recommend.",2
"View from rooms, location, hospitality , pool side bar , morning breakfast , arrival drink everything about this hotel was perfect . I requested them to arrange cake for my wife's birthday & they added champagne on their own . Wao . what else you want on holiday . Amazing hotel and extremely wonderful people . Just book and enjoy .",1
We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and had the most amazing time. All of the staff make an effort to get to know you and no request was ever too hard. They provided a thorough induction upon arrival letting you know everything you needed to know for your stay at the hotel and on the island and were available to us the entire time. We were very lucky and grateful to have been upgraded to the Princess Suite which was such a beautiful hotel room. Anyone who books this room will not be disappointed. We stayed at several hotels which rated themselves 5 stars during our stay in Greece and Mykonos Princess was the only hotel that I truly believed lived up to this rating. I will only stay here going forward that's for sure. Thanks team for everything :),1
"From initial contact to departure, our experience at the Mykonos Princess was superb. After reviewing various '5 star' hotels to finish our stay in Mykonos we opted for the Princess, it proved to be an excellent choice, from initial email contact to the service throughout our stay in this exquisite establishment to our departure we could not have asked for more.   Room Tip: Top floor with beach view was superb See more room tips",2
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Mykonos Princess. From the minute I arrived it was obvious that the staff here work REALLY hard to provide exceptionally good customer service. I have travelled extensively for the last 10 years and must say it is very rare to find service of this quality.The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. They arrange trips and recommend places to visit. They made an effort to learn my name and I always felt like no matter what I asked them for they would try and accommodate me.The staff tidied my room twice a day and closed the shutters in the evening leaving a print out for tomorrow's weather, sweets and little cards saying have a nice evening! They restocked the room with free bottled water every day. They even folded my clothes and lit a tea candle in my room whilst I was at dinner which is a lovely touch!The complimentary breakfasts were great with a nice selection of menu items. The dinner menu is also noteworthy as I enjoyed all of the dishes I tried. And room service was efficient and straightforward.I only have a few (tiny) criticisms. I love this hotel so do not want to be negative at all BUT although the hotel is VERY nicely decorated, the traditional whitewash decor unfortunately highlights some areas for maintenance. In terms of facilities, I think the pool, gym and spa are quite small but it is a small hotel that caters for a relatively small amount of people at any one time so maybe this is to be expected. Some of the 'sea-view' rooms are slightly obscured by other suites so your view of the sea is restricted but these things did not affect my overall enjoyment of the trip.I would therefore strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing place to stay, close to a small beach, with great food and 5 star customer service!",1
I want to once again thank the staff and management of this wonderful establishment. From hello to goodbye everything you could expect or imagine and beyond was thought. You are treated in a friendly and attentive fashion. Service in all areas was plain great. Food was outstanding. Pool areas bar areas and rooms were clean neat and new with lots of space. They have deserved every single star and positive reviews here. Thank you so much for being an unforgettable part of our honeymoon.,1
"What a lovely hotel! I would really recommend this hotel! All the staff are so lovely and thoughtful, we went to the beach a couple of days and reception gave us beach towels and water to take (we didn't ask they offered). We had a beautiful room by the pool which smelt really fresh and clean. We lounged by the pool some days and the hotel staff would come round and top up our water glasses, bring home made lemonade round and all sorts of treats and cold towels to cool down with- all of this was just part of their fantastic service! They have a shuttle service running you into town and back from town- the last one being 11.15pm.Breakfast was fantastic, all fresh and you order from a menu rather than buffet style. I have stayed in other hotels in Mykonos and this is by far the best without spending thousands and I am usually very picky about hotels! Would highly recommend!   Room Tip: rooms by the pool are lovely See more room tips",2
"From the moment we set foot in reception to the moment we checked out-everything was perfect!!!I am sure anyone who is reading this review will think it is fake, but believe me-it's not!!The reception staff were fantastic, making us feel comfortable instantly. We had drinks, and were taken up to our room which was really lovely. Not the Savoy, but very comfortable bed, pillows etc.Fantastic shower, large room, sea view, lots of power points-essential for all the electronic stuff we all carry around with us.First class wi-fi, again essential.Lovely pool, a beach a minutes walk away.Then the food!!!!Usually food in a hotel is above average at best, but this was truly wonderful.Great breakfasts, and all the other meals were stupendous!!We tried to eat there most of the time.I would go back in an instant.Really, really wonderful",2
"The Mykonos Princess is a fabulous hotel. The staff is so warm, welcoming and professional and the rooms and facilities are lovely. The location is perfect - just a short distance to Mykonos town, with stunning views. We'll be back!! A great spot for a relaxing vacation.",0
we travelled10 all over the world and always staying 5 stars hotels and we can say without a doubt that we enjoyed one of the best hospitality we never seen before combined with high level services . They have made this travel experience an unforgettable one   Room Tip: room 101 was excellent with an excellent view See more room tips,0
"It was the best choice I made in Mykonos. I have been there many times for business but this hotel is just beautiful. Just 5 minutes to the city centre but also in a quiet area up on the top of the hill. The staff was exceptional. Very friendly and informative. Pool bar very nice and the coctails, restaurant very nice and breakfast tasty and rich as well.The are all so happy to help you and inform you and make your stay as pleasant as they can. The rooms are wonderful, big and spacious. Private balconies as well with nice views from Ag. Stefano. I highly recommend everyone to visit this hotel! and I will definately visit again. Thank you!!!",2
"Absolutely amazing hotel!We stayed here for one night after being stranded in Mykonos from the hotel staff in Santorini wrongly telling us we could go to Mykonos for a day trip.The staff at Mykonos Princess Hotel were extremely helpful in our hour of need, they even upgraded our room too! Their uniform is very greek and suited the decor of the hotel. We loved every detail of the hotel. The bar staff are very nice and friendly too. We had lunch at the hotel which was amazing, there is so much variety on the menu.",1
We arrived and were greeted with champagne and Greek sweets. We were then given a tour of the grounds and taken to our room which was immaculately clean and tastefully decorated. The staff is available 24/7 and is more than happy to make you comfortable. We stepped out for a few hours to relax at one of the beaches and returned to find our room tidy and my friends dress neatly folded on the bed. Every evening the staff stops by your room with chocolate and the weather forecast for the following day. This hotel was beyond 5 star and much more than I expected. Would definitely recommend. All of the best beaches are a 10minute drive away.,1
"A really good hotel made a great Hotel by the staff. The hotel is in a quiet location with a pool the overlooks the sea, its decorated very well and is welcoming. the rooms are spotless with the biggest bed that i've ever slep in. The deal breaker are the staff, they are so friendly and accomindating they truely make your stay. Cleopatra met us at reception and from then on she was our go to person for everything we needed, she organised a personal trip around the island, taking in all the best beaches ending up at a 16 century monestry and a meal in the nearby village square. She was a true star who went the extra mile to make our stay unforgetable. And a great asset to the Hotel, although Anna and Swindon also looked after us very well.Pedro, Boobies, Anna and Marie in the resturant attended our every whim and their customer service was awesome, i would recomemmend the steak as outstanding. In Janus who runs the Bar they have an award winning mixologist who's cocktails where mind blowing. He has a cocktail that came 2nd in a National Championship and is well worth a taste.Hercules who is the driver of the shuttle bus is always on hand to run you around or give you some local knowledge.I have mentioned these members of staff but i could have mentioned everyone at the hotel as the Customer service is incredible, and it is the staff that make this hotel an outstanding hotel.Thank you for everythingSteve & Di",3
"Stayed in a suite at this extremely clean & functional hotel away from the chaos of Mykonos centre. The staff was super friendly, helpful and the driver Hercules was kind enough to drive us every day to the town centre for a small fee! We felt taken care. Great service!",2
"This hotel was beautiful. The views from every window were like a postcard. Breakfast each day was amazing and the setting is gorgeous. The service was excellent- from getting our bags to our room, to getting a rental car agent to come to the hotel for us, to the warm but professional service of all the staff. The one draw back is that there is only one hotel van, and we waited a very long time for a ride back from town one night. If I had to only visit one place for the rest of my life, it might be this hotel.",3
"We stayed at the Princess in September and absolutely loved our stay. The hotel itself is beautiful and the pool is perfect for lounging. Breakfast outside by the pool was the perfect way to start a day in paradise. The hotel manager (sadly, I can no longer recall his name) was so pleasant and really went out of his way to make our stay memorable...in fact the entire staff is great. Rooms were very large and (I think) mist have a view. Some of the rooms are directly over the pool area, which looks like may be a little noisy, but ours was a short walk through the property and silent at night. Note that the hotel is not very close to the town, but a shuttle is provided (which we used every night and is painless). I would 100% return to the Princess.",1
"We went there on our honeymoon in july 2015 and we really enjoyed it! Very helpful staff, spacious and super clean room with an amazing view (you can see the beach from your bed). Excellent breakfast next to the pool. Simply amazing! We're coming back this summer with friends",3
"We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon. Upon arrival we needed to get to a doctor, the staff were so helpful and drove us to the pharmacy and Doctor. The bar tender was also great, providing us with great tips! The rooms are spacious with AC and the breakfast is good value! It is a bit of a distance to Mykonos town and paradise beach, but in Mykonos it's better to hire a quad or bike to get around anyway, so the distance factor is negligible.",2
"Our stay in Mykonos Princess hotel was great. The rooms were very beautiful and the staff was nice and helpful. It has a great view over the port and Mykonos town, who's just 10 min by car/atv from the hotel.",2
"This is the second time that we came to this hotel this summer. The second time we brought some friends over as well. The rooms are great, we got upgraded both times to larger rooms with amazing sea views. The pool is great, the food at the pool and restaurant is amazing, the gym has a very good number of equipment, more than I've typically seen at other hotels. The hotel is a few miles north of town (I haven't counted really), but it's a 10 minute drive, and if you're somebody like who appreciates some quiet / romantic time and at the same time easy access to town, then you'll find this location to be perfect. Best of all is the service, everybody that works at the hotel, including the front desk, bar, restaurant and housekeeping is extremely friendly, helpful and very cordial. Generally I noticed that people in Myknos work very hard, and we got good service everywhere really, but I appreciated that folks at the Princess hotel seemed like very genuine people as well.   Room Tip: You'll get upgraded if you'e booking out of the high season See more room tips",2
"The hotel is in a prime location which is quiet, has fantastic views, close to the beach and easy access to the main town. All of the rooms have be refurbished this year in a very pleasing contemporary fashion. The staff could not be more helpful and the breakfast was top quality including cooked to order items.   Room Tip: Try a suite for extra space. See more room tips",1
"This was genuinely one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a long time. The rooms were spacious with fantastic views over the bay. Service was unbelievably good, nothing is ever too much trouble and the restaurant gave us one of the best meals we had in Mykonos (not to mention a very good cocktail bar next to the pool). Quite simply, if you have the opportunity to stay here... you absolutely should. 10/10 all round.",2
"upon arrival we were greeted with a smile and a glass of wine which was followed by a brief intro of mykonos island (review of map)... their kind gestures of genuine service reminded me of the 5 star boutique property by lungarno in florence which we absolutely loved and is extremely high end. we found out that this property recently underwent a reno last year. the rooms are clean, beds comfy, views spectacular... most of all, service is impeccable. we were impressed by the included breakfast - and grateful it ends later at 11 am. oh yea and with their 24hr room service. we're only half way thru our stay here at Princess and so grateful we found this gem! what great value!! thank you for the awesome hospitality. this is what vacation is all about.",1
We had such a pleasant stay at princess. The staff was extremely warm and gracious and made us feel welcomed and at homeFrom the moment we arrived. The room was big and new and the bed very comfortable. The restaurant on site is amazing. Very close to downtown and the beach outside the hotel (3 minute walk) is gorgeous.,1
"We have just returned from a fantastic weeks stay at the Mykonos Princess Hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel we were offered a glass of wine and then also sent a bottle of wine to the room on behalf of the hotel (this is a nice touch). Our room was also upgraded to a sea view suite. The hotel has recently been refurbished to a modern standard and looks great throughout.The swimming pool is small but good enough to cool down. The sunbeds around the pool are very comfortable and the staff are constantly replacing the towels each time people leave. We have a young daughter so spent most morning's at the beach which is a 5 minute walk away and would return to the hotel for the afternoon once she had let off a little steam.One of the best features of the hotel are the staff. Every single one of them was absolutely fantastic. A special mention must go to the barman John who was great. His cocktails were very good - One small negative here is that the cocktails start from €15 which seems a little excessive, when you like a drink on holiday they soon add up.We went into Mykonos town for a few evenings and the hotel provide a free shuttle bus that starts at 8pm. You could walk into town if you fancied a long walk but given your on holiday and there is a shuttle bus why would you.Overall this hotel is great and we would certainly recommend it.",4
"Great location, great customer service with welcoming of guests, great views, awesome food, awesome breakfast, very clean, no complaints at all.The town area is down the hill. Not too many taxi services in the area so rent a car or ATVs hotel will help with that.   Room Tip: Great views, great location, no elevators See more room tips",1
"Stayed here in July 2015. The Manager (Alexander) and his team could not be more helpful or charming, nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is small with only 40 rooms although you'd never guess there were that many. It's perfectly located around the bay from Mykonos town overlooking the bay and the harbour. Getting in to the centre of town is easy as they run a shuttle bus back and forth and it only takes 5 minutes. Much nicer to be out of the centre of town as it gets over run by tourists off the cruise ships.This might be a hotel to suit everyone as they play chilled out house music by the pool during the day and, whilst it's at a suitably low volume, those wishing for peace and quiet/silence might not appreciate it.The food is sublime on top of the lovely view, very comfortable and nicely decorated rooms.Highly recommend the Princess.",3
"One of my best hotel experiences ever. The hotel is beautiful with a modern, trendy vibe. The scene overlooking the city from the pool is lovely. Breakfast and everything we had from the poolside menu was quite tasty, but the best feature was really the service. The staff here went out of their way to respond to every request we made (and quickly), whether it was helping us charter a boat for a group day cruise, restaurant reservations/recommendations, or arranging transport around town. They really aim to please here and to make your visit as easy/seamless as possible. They were all just so lovely, accommodating and genuinely nice. I highly recommend this hotel. If I make it back to Mykonos, I will be staying here again.",2
"I honestly have to say that on the whole I preferred my stay at the Princess more than my stay at the Grace. My room was better at The Princess, with spectacular views over the sea from every window. Both hotels use the same excellent natural, Greek, beauty/body products. The room was clean and modern. The Grace gave us a complimentary bottle of white wine and water every day and The Princess did not. But the Princess did a allow us a late checkout on my last day as I was ill.My room was very quiet, service excellent, food good and lovely swimming pool!Would highly recommend this hotel!",2
"Beautiful newly renovated room which was spacious and well set out with great ocean and pool views. The moment you step into the reception area you can't help but smile and feel a sense of calmness. Breakfast was plentiful with a several dishes cooked to order. My only complaint is having to pay for a cappuccino, I feel at breakfast time this should be included. The staff at the resort including the owner, were lovely, very friendly and helpful - especially Alex. The pool area was perfect (not big) with double lounges to relax on whilst sipping on a cocktail or two. The hotel is in a quiet location being only a 7 minute car ride into town. They do offer a free shuttle bus at night to take you to town and pick you up. Hiring a car or an ATV bike is good idea to go exploring the Island. Overall had a wonderful relaxing experience and would stay again.",4
This is a beautiful hotel with large rooms more like hotels in the US. Very modern decor with views of the sea. The breakfast is fantastic cooked to order. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the owner personally greets every guest. Great shower and very comfortable beds. there is a fantastic beach less than half a block from the hotel that is not crowded and very clean.,2
"We arrived really late due to a delay on our flight from Athens. We arrived late at night and the person attending was Panos, this guy was such a nice person that made it all good as we were very tired and hungry, he offered room service for us and prepared food also himself. Our villa was a 3 story villa with the most beautiful views you can think of, the place had every amenity you can think. Comfortable and the pool was awesome. Breakfast was included in our room and they had an amazing service, food and variety to enjoy in the morning. By the way their beach is probably at the end of the trip we concluded the nicest one of the island, when you put everything under perspective. We rented ATV and travel the island all over. This hotel is really awesome and we were very happy when we saw it the next day in daylight and enjoying the views and beauty of their structure. Recommend it   Room Tip: Every villa and room has an awesome view for sure See more room tips",1
"We had gone to Greece for our honeymoon. Since we spent more time exploring Mykonos than being in the room, so the hotel worked out pretty well. The hotel is extremely beautiful. It's little far from the main tourists attraction. There are two ways of going to the windmill area, either walk or take a taxi. Walking could be too much, so we chose to take taxis. The taxi charges 5 euros one side. Not bad!The pool is prettiest and hotel interior is great. We had gone when the hotel was serving its last round of guests before it takes a break for couple of months (during the non season time) and so we could see a lot things on the concluding stage. The room that was assigned was average. The room was ordinary with very ordinary furniture and bathroom. The staff is not very prompt. In a nutshell, room was nothing in comparison to the beauty of the hotel. They did seem to have nicer rooms available as well but despite insisting, they gave us the basic room only. I would recommend this hotel, but suggest that you stay closer to the beach and windmill area, so you could walk places.",3
"This is the most friendliest Boutique Type -hotel ever. Very close to city center. From the moment of arrival to the end departure, this Family management will take care of you. I had a fall while in town, they immediately provided me medicine, they arranged our transport to nearby beach, their FREE shuttle service old port runs hourly after 8pm to the old port and town -which is 10minutes picturesque drive (only 10Euros during the day on private basis), Sinatra singing at the lobby. Patient, Polite, Perfect Location with the greatest Views. 100% Good. Breakfast, Wi-Fi Excellent, Amenities, Pool, Bar, large Cabana style sun-beds - JUST ALL GREAT.  It was exactly what our clients had been describing.Marotravelteck@aol.com Travelteck.com   Room Tip: 501 has great view See more room tips",1
"Overall, this hotel was super comfortable and clean with an updated design. Room was spacious. Staff was very welcoming. The location is not the best if you do not have a car as it's close to the new port. If you are traveling by boat with no car, I would recommend staying somewhere closer into Chora.   Room Tip: Stayed in room 206 See more room tips",0
"The hotel is in a quite location with views across the bay to the pretty main town. The hotel is comfortable with good showers and comfortable beds. Nice pool area yet the best thing about the hotel is the staff. Distasteful and his young team go out of there way to look after the guests various needs. The staff are attentive and thoughtful. Great bar and kitchen team. The head chef created numerous exciting and different dishes that were not on the regular menu.   Room Tip: Away from the pool, area 305 is a good choice See more room tips",2
"We booked a comfort room and got a luxury suite. So nice, friendly and complaisant people! The breakfast was amazing with all you need and wishes were welcome! First stay and more will follow! Looking forward to are our next trip to Mykononos!",1
"Mykonos Princess Hotel is at Agios Stefanos, close to the ferry harbour and nor far away from the city center. We stayed there as a group of friends at the Friends&Family Maisonette. This one is like a separate 3-floor apartment with a beautiful terrace at the rooftop. The staff, the lovely ladies at the reception made our days in Mykonos remarkable. They were able to provide any service we asked, especially transfers during late night! They made our life easier! The pool is small and nice. The rooms are clean. The breakfast is just right, not miss the spinach Greek pie. we would definitely stay again here especially when we come as a group of friends.   Room Tip: If you travel in a group, go for the Friends&Family Maisonette. See more room tips",2
We spent 3 nights there and were happy with our selection of a modern and luxury place in MykonosThe staff was very helpful and we could have an early check in when we arrived - the rent of a car was also very easy and quickThe room with sea view was big and modern though some small negative things : glass door to the bathroom which means no privacy - the sea view was there but the window and the terrace were bery small so we enjoyed the view from the pool area more.. And again no washing line which is always very ennoying...The restaurant was very romantic for dinner - there was only an a la carte breakfast which we are not used to... Though was good...Overall a very romantic and pleasant choice!,0
From the moment we arrived we knew it was going to be a great week. The hotel is situated in the most serene part of the island. The staff at DeLight Boutique Hotel was so friendly and accommodating. The premises were spotless and the views were the best in all of Mykonos in my opinion. We loved the breakfast and the cocktails at the pool bar. We ate at the fine dining restaurant one evening and were blown away. Our room was spacious and clean with a great view of Delos from our balcony. The hotel concierge helped us rent an ATV as soon as we arrived and we spent our days exploring the rest of the island. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel.,0
"De.Light is truly second-to-none! One of the most impressive hotels by far, not only in Mykonos, but worldwide! The friendliest, most genuinely kind and attentive staff...immaculate cleanliness throughout...an extraordinary chef...Just a few points of many...! I honestly cannot fault this hotel in any way. An absolute blessing to have discovered De.Light. Truly heaven on earth, a little gem!",1
"It really felt special to visit this small hotel on the more remote and wind protected side of Mykonos, this is our way of relaxing! The professionally trained staff should be an example to every other hotel in the world, it is a pleasure to be served this way!Thanks to Eva's hospitality and the upgrading of our room. Thanks to Alex, Costa, Nicky for serving us so professionally, Nick for the ice buckets, and to the cleaning staff for all your great service and making our stay special!",1
"We stayed here for 2 weeks as a family of 5, in 2 rooms. I cannot fault the hotel and it was like a haven to come back to after a day on the beach or a night out in Mykonos town. The rooms are elegantly decorated, extremely quiet and the beds very comfy.The housekeeping staff I cannot praise highly enough. The rooms are spotlessly clean and nightly turn down service is done as if by magic once you have gone out for the evening. Breakfast is an unhurried, relaxing affair, looking out over the pool and sea. Very different to other 5 star hotels we have stayed in where it can be a bit of a""bun fight"". The concierge and reception staff are extremely helpful.The reliable bus service stops just outside the hotel every 30 minutes to go to Ornos and Mykonos Town.Also a small mini market just across from the hotel.We hired a car for a day and explored the beaches on the north of the island. Can recommend the Fokos taverna for lunch.The beach hopping boat taxi from Ornos is also a great way to experience the other beaches, especially Elia, where we had a wonderful lunch. Overall a thoroughly relaxing holiday whilst still enjoying the lively side of Mykonos. Would definitely return.",0
"Lovely,small hotel, with excellant staff, who you couldn't fault.Room very nice, and clean, beautiful pool, and nice setting, in a relaxing, quiet part of the island.Wouls definately recommend , particularly for couples.",0
"Beautiful hotel away from downtown ,but with a bus outside and a bottle shop across the road.!Food in restaurant was great,breakfast and dinner Ambience was terrific. Short stroll down to beach and umbrellas. Staff very friendly,was sad to leave",0
Above & beyond any needs and requests with a extra ordinary breathless taken view and environment. I could never believe as for so many years travelers that we could get such a value for money as well!!! I thought that this kind of service and such boutique hotel was at least in double price. Real affordable luxury and such a shame for so many boutique hotels that is not ethical to name them and charge double or sometimes triple for not even the half quality of the service of De.Light!!!,0
"Excellent and responsive staff. The rooms are very clean and are perfect for the location. The restaurant at the hotel is very underrated, it has excellent food. It is 5 mins walk from the beach and has fantastic restaurants around. Reception is very accomodative and will ensure you have the best stay. Highly recommended!",0
"Excellent staff, especially the bar and waiting staff, who were particularly hepful with great food and drink recomendations.The rooms were also very comfortable and enjoyed a great view over the bay!

"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights and as soon as we arrived the staff were so attentive and helpful. The hotel pool has an amazing view over the sea, and we hired quads to go and visit beaches nearby which were a 10-15 minute journey. The restaurant and pool menu prices were expensive, but the breakfast which was included was lovely and filled us up for the day. It was my partners birthday and the staff arranged a cake to be made and delivered to the room which was a lovely touch!",0
"Having stayed a few times in Mykonos, we chose the tranquillity of Aghios Ioannis and the De.light hotel. Never was a hotel better named! Previous reviews have praised the staff and they were absolutely right - all of the staff from the cleaners to the General Manager were terrific.Our stay was for 8 nights in a Superior suite (actually all 18 rooms are ""superior""). The room and views were first class and our whole experience was faultless.If you want a class hotel with fantastic service in a quiet location, you will find this an excellent choice.   Room Tip: Personally, we preferred the rooms on the second floor for best views and maximum sun. See more room tips",0
"De.Light is indeed delightful. A good location overlooking the sea, but away from the congestion and hug-a-mug of Mykonos Town. Unless you want to stay by the pool all day, or use taxis, you would need a hire car, scooter or ATV to get around the island, but that's not a big deal. The decor and style of the place is cool and relaxing. The pool and surroinding sunbathing area is lovely, with a bar nearby. Breakfasts are good, with a real menu! -- not the usual ""Breakfast Buffet"". Delicious fresh ornage or grapefruit juice; fresh pastries, and many other options. We ate out most of the time, so I can't really comment on the food at other meals, although the menu was interesting and the one snack lunch we had pool-side was very good. Our room was large, comfortable, airy, and well maintained, and the house-keeping was immaculate. The staff are all young and very helpful. We will be back!   Room Tip: Ground floor rooms are same level as pool. Next up are same level as Reception. Top floor have sligh... See more room tips",0
"We have just come back from a lovely week in this hotel. We have never been looked after so well, nothing is too much trouble . Kosta Alex Nikki and Nic the pool/restaurant staff cannot do enough for you and make you feel valued. The food is excellent and their fine dining is something you should try. Their French fries are not what you would normally expect, but a million times better.The rooms are cleaned thoroughly every day and towels changed twice a day.I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting Mykonos. Thank you for a lovely relaxing break. Janet & Richard",0
"Our stay here at the De.Light hotel in Mykonos is up there with one of the best holidays we've had. If your after a relaxing holiday then this is certainly a place to consider. If your after a taste of the local cuisine the hotel resturant offers a variety of different dishes, we'd recommend the lobster. If you would rather eat out but don't want venture too far, there are plenty of restaurants only a short walk away. We spent plenty of time just chilling by the pool. If you'd prefer a beach and a swim in the sea there are two beaches only a short walk from the hotel (5 mins max). One which offers a spectacular sunset. If you want to venture a bit further there are busses that run frequently from just outside the hotel into Mykonos town. The staff we're very attentive to our every need, they were very polite, friendly and spoke excellent English. A special thanks to Nicki, Alex, Nick and Kostas for your hospitality. I would strongly recommend coming here, we would love to come back. Thanks again to all the staff at the De.Light hotel who helped make this a holiday one we won't forget. Garry & Natasha",0
"Lovely hotel with 3 great places to eat on the doorstep (2 of which have really cool beach bars), short drive from Mykonos town & the nearer,smaller Ornos. It's near enough to enjoy everything without the noise pollution. There is zero road noise as rooms all face away from the road (that leads to a dead end) and face the sea. The staff's attention to detail makes this place super special. Rooms are well appointed and have super comfy beds with quiet air conditioning units, I really appreciated the Jacuzzi bath. Great breakfasts.   Room Tip: Ground floors have hot tubs, 1st floor terraces & top (2nd) floors balconies. There's a room... See more room tips",0
"My wife and I recently found ourselves in desperate need of a holiday. As she had visited Mykonos 16 years ago and raved about the beautiful location, it seemed to be a good idea to revisit this place , a little older and wiser. Choosing the hotel was easy. The photos and reviews of De.Light Hotel were incredible so we were sold. As I write this review on our last day looking out over the beautiful Aegean Sea in brilliant sunshine illuminating all varied and hypnotic colours that make up this island, and fully satisfied after the complimentary breakfast that words cannot describe , we can truly say that the De.Light Hotel was one of the best hotels we ever stayed in ; probably the best. The stunning decor and design of the hotel quietly nestled on the hillside of Agios Ionnis provided us with the much needed R&R. The team here are beyond compare. From the pick up at the airport , to the briefing we received upon arrival ,the cleaners who kept the hotel and especially our rooms immaculate (visiting 2x a day!), through to the amazing and top quality food prepared by the world class chef Thanos,.However the biggest thanks and appreciation must deservedly go to the hotels excellent and young team of waiting staff/ bartenders who aimed and succeeded beyond all expectations to make our stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. Their cheery disposition and high levels of customer service , attentive to all our needs ,at all times, made this holiday the most memorable we have enjoyed as a couple. So thank you to Nikki, Alex,Nick,and Kostas - you made us feel like more than guests - like staying with a family.Its important to know that being a boutique hotel ,you get the level of personal attention that you would receive from any other type of hotel. In addition , staying where we did , away from the noise and crowds of Mykonos centre or the famous beaches, added to our experience and in allowing us to fully relax but still able to venture out to those areas very easily using the local buses. We cannot rate the hotel,the location ,and the incredible team more highly. Hope to visit again.Thank you to everyone at De.Light!!!Karnan and Kimberley",0

"Very spacious room, good free breakfast, creative cuisine, very quiet and scenic position, extremely cordial and efficient staff, including the very friendly barman from Thessaloniki who would look great in a vest on chilly April evenings, and the extraordinarily helpful manager Adonis! Highly recommended!",0
Loved this place. The hotel is super clean and super friendly staff. Only few minutes away from town. Pool side restaurant serve the best breakfast in morning. Airport pick up drop arranged. Car arranged. Ferry tickets arranged. :) Going back here again in September. Highly recommended.,0
"We had a lovely stay. The staff were extremely friendly, from the start till the very end. The rooms were VERY clean!! Probably the cleanest we've ever experienced! It really was simply delightful! Thank you to everyone who made our stay comfortable and relaxing :)",0
"I liked this hotel. Friendly, helpful, relaxing, clean, efficient, quality - those are the words that spring to mind. Not without one or two faults but one thing that stood out for me was the quality of construction of the hotel. The quality of materials, for example around the pool area and in fact everywhere, was top notch and makes you think things were thought through in great detail when this hotel was built. We stayed in one of the ground floor rooms and I wouldn't change that. You have a little terrace area with an umbrella for shade, which was welcome and I think I would prefer that to the upper floors. Some would no doubt prefer the views from the higher level but I thought they were great anyway. The upper level, incidentally is at the level of the road outside. The rooms too had quality furnishings although we felt it was as though various people had been sent out to purchase them without talking to each other such was the lack of a cohesive style but that was just our perspective. Others may disagree. The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient and good for a friendly chat in the evenings at the bar when it was often quiet when we stayed. Like some other similar hotels, few seemed to take up the option of dining at the hotel in the evenings which made for a quiet time around the bar / pool area. It didn't matter to us. We had great seafood (which we like, especially fresh fish on Greek islands - how can life get any better !) in many excellent tavernas and the one opposite the hotel was no exception. Breakfast disappointed me. I suppose for this size of hotel it is tempting to not have a buffet but I'm not sure that is the best idea. I have stayed in small hotels with excellent quality cold buffets. Whilst I find hot buffets almost universally awful, I do like the experience of discovering new things on cold buffets and having an easier choice of what to have. The menu offerings were ok but didn't inspire me. Of course if there are things on the menu that you love, you will find it great but I wouldn't personally regard breakfast as a strong point of the hotel. They aren't much good with poached eggs either although the Greek omelette was nice, among the hot offerings, which I only drifted to because I was bored with the cold choices. Some may not find it an issue and the breakfast area was very relaxing, by the pool.Another negative point for me was the beach. Fairly easy to get to but very very busy with beds crammed in like you might find in a stereotypical advert for a ""very crammed beach"" ! Two average Tavernas (in my view) didn't hep either although the one which makes great play of it's ""Shirley Valentine"" connections (anyone under 40 will have to google it !) was reasonable. Just don't let them fillet the fish or you will be asleep by the time it is complete.The hotel will helpfully arrange car hire from an efficient, flexible, reliable and friendly firm and if you want to get a bus, it stops on the road which runs past the hotel, which is effectively a dead end at the bottom of the hill. It's an easy island to explore. Another example of the hotel offering everything you need for a relaxing stay. For sure that's what you will have here. A few minor points aside, I struggle to fault it.   Room Tip: Ground floor are quite different with outside terrace area and umbrella - I think a better choice See more room tips",1
"My wife and I stayed for 5 nights at the Delight hotel as part of our honeymoon at the end of June and had a wonderful stay. The manager was incredibly helpful and helped us organise a convertible Fiat 500 to travel around the beautiful island. This is in addition to organising a days sailing with Mykonos Cataraman. The staff could not do enough for you, whether it was in terms of organising dinner reservations, tours to places such as Delos or looking after to you around the pool. The rooms were beautifully decorated with a lovely view of the stunningly blue sea outside and the refreshing pool.The breakfast was of a very high standard and the pool was extremely well maintained.The hotel is located in a somewhat quieter part of Mykonos, but that was part of the attraction for ourselves and getting around the island is incredibly easy. There are nice beaches and a decent beach bar within a mere 10-15 minute walk. However, there is bus that stops right outside the hotel (10 mins to Mykonos Town) and with a car you can travel all over the island in a matter of hours to some stunning beaches and coves. We will certainly look to come back to the beautiful island of Mykonos and would not stay anywhere other than the Delight.",7
"From the moment we booked our hotel, the service was amazing! Maria worked with me before we arrived via email, and was there to greet us personally. She truly made us (and other guests) feel like we were her only priority. The young men working in the bar and pool area were also extremely attentive. The property is beautiful, with amazing views, and the rooms/suites are much larger than most boutique hotels and certainly larger than anything we've experienced in Europe.",2
"It is sometimes a worry that with a lovely set of photos a hotel can appear better than it is; rest assured here the reality is every bit as good if not better. If you are looking for a romantic, small, personable hotel, away from the crowds with fantastic food and gorgeous sunsets then you will not be disappointed. It is a quiet corner of the island but if you want to get to the more busy Mykonos Town during the day or evening there is a regular bus service that takes about 15mins. As well as a fantastic a la carte breakfast menu where you could eat something different every day if you wished, the pool side menu and the fine dining menu were also both excellent and together with cocktails could be enjoyed beside a twinkling poolside watching the sunset. We had to make ourselves leave it was so perfect and relaxing. From the time we arrived until the time we left nothing was too much trouble and everyone went out of their way to make our stay the best possible. In conversation with other guests we agreed this hotel and our experience was ""paradise""",2

"We decided to visit Mykonos and now we can say that we do a great choice.It was really a boutique hotel and all the staff do its best to feel perfect.They serve an excellent a-la-carte breakfast and maybe single thing thats is missing is champagne. You can lay on the sun chairs from the beach nearby that are for free for hotel guests. Nice, clean and spacious rooms all with sea view.High class toiletries and sheets and also provided towels for beach or pool.In this noisy island if you are looking for quiet than Agios Ioannis is the perfect place.",0
"My husband and I stayed at this boutique hotel for seven nights in July. It was ideal for our honeymoon, as we wanted a superior, romantic and peaceful stay. Quality is in fact high in everything: a comfortable and clean room, ours was directly on the pool area, view is spectacular (the best after Santorini), food is great, fresh and so tasty, and of course the excellent service: these guys are there for YOU and to make you have an unforgettable stay. You start with a very warm welcome. Breakfast is a-la-carte only and breakfast service in the room is available but I had the impression that it was not a priority for them - it is a pity as we really like it. We had it just once, as breakfast tables in the shadow were full...and we did not want to wait there to have breakfast. Excellent service at the pool area. Cocktails were great. Pool area has in fact only a few beds and umbrellas, but we always found one....during the day, we stayed at the hotel only one day as you dont go to Mykonos to stay at the hotel...but when the wind was really strong we preferred to remain here. The only negative thing, is that with strong wind they close umbrellas and I could not remain there in sun all day long...so I had to remain in the room for some time....not the best. The hotel has unfortunately not a connection to a private beach, but with a 5 mins walk you get to a beach that is free for the guests of the hotel and so well protected from the wind (probably the only one protected beach on the island). Of course you need a car or motorbike or quad to stay in this area of Mykonos (we refused to take the bus) but to me this is also the most beautiful part of the island.Wifi was very slow, but this was common everywhere on the island.In general we recommend this hotel especially if you like to be 'spoilt'...for us sometimes it was too much :) in Greece we usually prefer more 'typical' or less 'fancy' solutions and we love buffet breakfast...but in Mykonos this is OK, and sometimes it's good to be spoiled ;)For what concerns the price, it is aligned with the avarage prices of this island, and with the quality of service and food. This is a beautiful boutique hotel in Mykonos, you cannot expect to spend less. A last suggestion for the team: please also consider to offer vegetal milk, like soya or almond or rice milk...it was a bit disappointing to see you did not offer it (for vegetarians and lactose intolerant people) and did not offer to buy it once the customer says he is intollerant to lactose. We had to buy it at a supermarket and bring it to breakfast...not the ideal in such a hotel.",0
"Out of the ten hotels we used the De.Light was by far the best. New, clean, modern, and with a wonderful staff. Location near the end of dead end street made the hotel very peaceful. Sitting around the pool while enjoying the tremendous views of the sea in such a great environment was wonderful. They helped us rent an ATV to tour the rest of the Island.   Room Tip: I do not think they have a bad room. Ours was pool level. See more room tips",0
"This hotel is in a beautiful peaceful location! The rooms are large and very well done, and have a large balcony with a view of the water and the pool. All of the staff were so friendly and happy to get you anything. The welcome drink at check-in was so refreshing. The girl in reception sits down with you with a map of the island and gives you a lot of information on the places and restaurants you might want to try.We thought there were enough chairs in the pool area, it was a beautiful place to just sit and relax. At night there are lights sparkly in the pool to look like stars-very beautiful!The breakfasts were delicious. We had dinner there one night which was also very good. The guys that work the bar/restaurant/pool area do a great job. Other than very hard beds, we loved this hotel. It is a little way from the city so very quiet and peaceful, which is what we look for. However, if you want to be near all the action and parties you may want to chose a different hotel.",0
"Had a weeks holiday in this beautiful hotel. Good location. Quiet and peaceful, just what we wanted.Room was clean and nicely decorated. Only downside was that there was no coffee/tea making facilities available. Room service was available though 24/7.Staff were excellent! Cannot fault the service at all! Thank you guys!!",0
"Second visit this year for me as was bowled over the first time by this excellent , very special hotel . All the staff without exception are so professional yet present a unique personal touch . The location is brathtaking . The food is of a very very high standard . This place feels like a friends villa but with every need catered for . 10/10 - well done",0
"Had memorable time from start to finish at this beautiful hotel. Perfectly located far enough from the noise / nightlife in Mykonos Town to have some peace and quiet however close enough to pop in and out when you choose (15 minute bus ride). We hired a quad bike which we felt was the best way to get around the island. Staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful and sat down with us on arrival and made suggestions about where to go and what to do during your stay. Our room was large and had amazing sea views which you could see from entering the room and could also enjoy from the balcony. Cant say we were too disappointed about the Jacuzzi bath in our ensuite either! Breakfast was a highlight due to a) the black eyed bean salad, b) the breath-taking views over the infinity pool to the sea and c) the attentive staff.Attention to detail at this hotel was second to none and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Would highly recommend!   Room Tip: All rooms have a sea view See more room tips",0
"Built to make the best use of the location and views over the Aegean, this Hotel is certainly different from most. Totally professional service from Reception staff, and very willing, if sometimes, amateur service from the Restaurant, Bar and Pool staff. The pool is delightful, very small, ideal for cooling off, but not for those who count swimming as a necessity-Photographs in various holiday brochures showing the ""infinity"" pool are somewhat misleading. The lack of sunloungers was apparently due to storm damage caused earlier in the summer but it raised a problem at the time we visited. Piped music from 8 am - late, around pool, bar, restaurant. Suggest a car is essential to visit the many beautiful beaches on the island, although there is a bus stop outside the Hotel. Visitors with limited mobility may struggle with the steep gradients in the locality. Plenty of freshly cooked food available throughout the day with a hint of the Mediterranean; the Taster menu in the evening was excellent both for food quality and value. Eating by the pool in the evening, with the sea a mere 100 metres below was an experience in itself. Suites are spacious and clean. Wi-Fi free throughout. No noise at night.",1
"This hotel is a gem and the staff are the jewels in the crown! From the moment you arrive and witness the stunning view, Maria and Caterina make you feel so welcome and cannot help you enough. Rooms are spacious with beautiful views and spotlessly clean. Magical memories of dining by the pool at night. The tasting menus are amazing. Thank you so much to Bill, John, Alex and Christoph for looking after us so well and for being such great company. We loved you all and we loved the Delight hotel!",0
"After many experiences in the cycladic islands for years now and also in Mykonos, we finally found the hotel we were looking for in Mykonos, THE DELIGHT is magic!!!The team is managing the hotel perfectly with a touch of kindness which is super appreciated during this type of jouney,everything was perfect, we would like to thank the whole team for welcoming us for our 3 first nights at the hotel, the best news are that we have only 355 days to come back!

"We were happy with our room in general. It was clean, nice decoration and comfortable. The Staff is amazing, the girls Maria and Catarina were really sweet and gave us information about everything. They were fast and ready to help.The Hotel is in a good location but you need to have a car. It's not a walking distance of anything and you don't want to wait for a bus, which can take forever, we gave a ride for 2 people that was waiting for the bus over 45 min. In my opinion the hotel looks better in the pictures but it is beautiful, the view is spectacular. I was a little bit disappointed with the pool area, I was expecting more based on the pictures. The menu is very simple and the ""night menu"" is really poor. Because the hotel is a little bit isolate If you need something to eat after midnight you don't have options. I think for the price the hotel is fine. For the price that I paid I was expecting more but I would stay there again.It's definitely quite at night, It's not a hotel for single people. I would recommend it for couples or family.   Room Tip: Ocean View rooms are amazing. The hotel has a incredible view. See more room tips",1
"outstanding. Beautiful & peaceful vista. Amazing cuisine - every meal was superb, including breakfast... and the most accommodating and helpful service ever . Maria and Katerina and the boys at the pool/ restaurant were simply awesome,   Room Tip: choose away from the restaurant/ pool area See more room tips",1
"Amazing hotel!I travelled with my daughter who is 15 and very fussy, she was in love with this hotel so much so that she didn't want to leave it not even to go to the beach!!!However we did go to the beach which is a ten min walk away! They just have got the right atmosphere at the pool area just right, also they have fantastic staff, helpful and friendly!The food is incredible my daughter wanted to marry the chief! Hotel is spotless, room was large and view of the sunset is beautiful.Maria was lovely and very helpful, she helped me book a quad bike and find my way in busses to see other beaches.The spa massage I had was amazing and my daughter had the facial which she loved!Transfers were complimentary in luxury cars!!The room was cleaned in detail everyday and clean towels given!The only negative I can say is we never wanted to leave!I would definitely go back again!!!",0
"Sweet little hotel, a bit outside of Mykonos. Really wonderful staff who were thoughtful and helpful in most every way. The hotel is well outside of downtown both a plus and a minus. It is quiet, has a lovely view, reasonable food and menu and within a short walk up the street to a beach. I think the rooms were quite nice and i used 2 different ones. The most expensive one was a spa room and while large was on the ground level. While technically with a view it was not easily enjoyed as the sleeping area was separated from the ""view"" by a wall. The room is large and has 2 showers for reasons I don't quite understand.At 800+ euro's I would have expected a better orientation to the room. I asked to be moved to an upstairs room which had a sweet balcony, nice sitting area and lovely view. Frankly I should have received a small refund but didn't as the room rate was materially different.Transportation is a CHALLENGE here which i did not know but the Hotel set me up with a driver who was generally available with some notice.Finally, the pool while nice was relatively small and not really for serious swimming.   Room Tip: ask for upper level rooms See more room tips",1
"Delight. That is what you will find in this incredible little paradise in the quiet and chic zone of Agios Ioannis.- Very nice suites,- Fantastic service and quality specially at breakfast.- Incredible staffSpeciallly greetings from Spain to the staff : Maria, Katerina and EvaMiguel Cervantes",1
"We stayed in the hotel for 1 night, and it just was unforgettable. The service by Maria the host of the hotel was unbelievable. It took them to get me my room with 4 hours delay, but Maria apologized for that and even gave an exclusive dinner for me and my girlfriend. The hotel located in the most quiet area in Mykonos, No children in the hotel, the view is amazing from the balcony of the 3rd floor. The rooms are very big and clean. the small restaurant in the front of the pool serving gourmet food and drinks.Very recommended for couples.   Room Tip: room with a balcony and sea view on second or third floor See more room tips",2
"Exceptional boutique hotel. The staff is outstanding -- helpful, kind, and friendly. Maria was an outstanding hostess -- helping us with restaurant reservations, reserving ATV's, modifying transport times, and bringing a nail tech on-site for mani/pedis. Maria, Maria, Maria! A+++. The location is ideal -- right in front of the bus stop to downtown, but in a quiet location with a beach in walking distance. The room was very nice and comfortable, although we did have a problem with the shower flooding the bathroom which they were still working to rectify when we departed. Other than that, it was an outstanding stay and I would highly recommend De.Light!",1
"Some hotels just know how to make guests feel welcome. Such as sending a letter with information a couple of days before check-in, picking you up at the airport free of charge and welcoming you with a bottle of wine and a quick tour around the hotel. It won't take long, the hotel only has 18 rooms, all facing the Agean ocean. It is located in a quiet village, just an eight minute taxi ride from town and from the airport. Agios Ioannis is perfect if you want to have peace but at the same time the opportunity to go party. Just be aware that you might have to wait a bit for a taxi, as there are only 30 taxis on the island. (Private transfers can be arranged though.) The hotel itself is stylish, light and clean. The pool area where you'll also enjoy your a la carte breakfast is wonderfully situated above the bay with stunning views of the Aegean ocean. There is no direct beach access. The closest beach is a five minute walk away, and the staff will gladly reserve a sunbed for you, on the hotel's expense.Speaking of the staff. I know it has been said in numerous reviews, but they are truly lovely. Personal and friendly, but not over the top. No questions left unanswered. They will do anything to make their guests comfortable. There are at least three restaurants close to the hotel, and they are all decent. The best food we had was however at the hotel's own restaurant. A small supermarket across the street provides snacks and drinks and ice cream.Our room was nice with a big balcony offering stunning ocean views. Be advised that not all rooms seem to have that spectacular view. The room was big and clean. There are all the amenities you'd expect from at hotel of this standard. On the negative side there is not much to say. We kind of missed a gym, and the wifi wasn't always stable. The door knobs are designed so that is impossible to open the door if your hands a wet or has sunscreen on them. We did not try the massages that were offered.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, especially couples. Maybe not couples travelling with small children (but that goes for all of Mykonos). Thanks to the staff for making our holiday very comfortable. Katerina in the reception put it nicely when I instinctively started carrying my bag to my room: ""Don't forget you're on vacation."" I really hope to be back!   Room Tip: Ask for a room with a balcony upon reservation. See more room tips",1
"Well worthy of other 5 star ratings on this sight.The staff especially deserve a mention for their unforced friendliness, helpfulness and attentiveness. Stunning location. Lovely local beach and many other picturesque and varied beaches to explore. 3 alternative restaurants to the hotel within five minutes walk. Varying prices all excellent. Hotel food delicious with excellent service. Lovely island. Easy to get around. Mykonos town fascinating. Trip to Delos fascinating.   Room Tip: All rooms have sea view - choose top floor for best view See more room tips",0
"The secret of this hotel is quite simply the most exceptional service we've ever received, anywhere. The hotel itself is beautiful; clean, well kept and maintained to a very high standard. All rooms have a wonderful sea view. The food is outstanding from the a la carte breakfast (now we've experienced this we'll always resent a buffet!) to the fine dining experience under the stars - everyone who stays should enjoy at least one of these suppers. A big thank you to Maria, Bill, Alex, Chris plus everyone else who made us feel so welcome. You're one in a million.",1
"We stayed for our honey moon and had a great experience, the people in the hotel are very warm and offer a great service, the breakfast food is amazing and the hotel amenities are very clean and the hotel has a great view.I will definitely come back if I ever visit Mykons again !!",0
"Just returned from a wonderful week's stay here which really wanted to be much longer.. The hotel is beautiful, spotlessly clean,serene,relaxing,great rooms with superb attention to detail....My only suggestion would have liked tea/coffee making facilities in my room as I do love my early morning cup of tea and don't always want to call room service!However it is just a suggestion...But I have to echo previous comments.....It is the staff who truly make your stay so special.... Nothing is too much for them to help you with to make your stay so wonderful..Huge hugs to Maria and Katerina who are simply amazingAnd the guys in the bar/restaurant/pool ares are just so much fun and very attentive and they all work so very hard..They are all a fantastic team and their manager should be so grateful he is very lucky to have such a wonderful and supportive team working so hard for him during these difficult times for the Greek community...Once again thank you all so much for making our first trip to Mykonos so fabulous...We will return...Suzanne and Han",0
"Stayed here as a couple at the end of May. The rooms and bathroom are of a high standard with a great view from the balcony. The whole place is spotlessly clean aswell. Handy little fridge in the room. Extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Plenty of hangers and wardrobe space. There's a TV in the room but no music station or docking station for music. All staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was really good. It's a very short walk to the lovely little beach that has two excellent bar/restaurants (with free sun beds and umbrellas for hotel guests). There's also a great restaurant directly opposite the hotel, so you don't need to walk very far at all to go out in the evening. The local bus stops outside the hotel if you want to go into Mykonos town - a very reasonable €1.60. It's also not too far to walk into Mykonos town during the day but not at night as there are no pavements on some sections. Would definitely recommend the De.Light for a peaceful luxurious break.",0
"The best breakfast I have ever had, anywhere! Amazing service in a tranquil environment that has breathtaking views. The staff were so welcoming and friendly and extremely helpful. The 3 ladies in the reception, went out of their way to make sure that we see Mykonos in the best possible manner. Congrats! The best concierge services I have had for years! The hotel is up on a hill a few minutes walk from Ayios Gianis. Remember to try the restaurant. High Quality ingredients, well cooked & perfectly presented. Above all , superb taste with the right service - effective & discreet. Everything was lovely, just like the island, joyful, elegant and with a great variety of choices.My only concern is the Manager, who had a bit of attitude. In the beginning I thought, OK, its the Mykonos way of things, cause I saw it happening elsewhere. But in his case it became unacceptable. Almost insulting. I cannot imagine how this man inspires his team...Nevertheless, and overall. DeLight is the best choice in Mykonos.   Room Tip: Try the gourmet menu....its overwhelming... See more room tips",2
"What a beautiful place to spend your honeymoon! We were there for 4 nights and absolutely loved it. The staff are super friendly and helpful; they met us at the airport, welcomed us with drinks and orientation about what to do and where to go. They helped us rent a car and gave us excellent recommendations. The hotel has a pool of its own and excellent facilities. We will definitely be back soon!",1
"The title says it all. We love this place for the peace and relaxation. It was my third visit with my daughter, we stayed for 5 nights. The staff are friendly, helpful and can't do enough for you. Breakfasts are amazing, served by the pool with a gorgeous view over the bay. Although situated about 10 mins from Mykonos town there are frequent buses that stop right outside the hotel. Can't wait to return in September with my husband!",0
Sixty of us came here for a wedding. The service was excellent. The staff went out of their way for us. The beach is near by and the pool is excelled. The breakfast is fantastic. I would highly recommend this place.,0
"Though located 4 km away from the centre, the hotel has a Beautiful view,Very kind staff, a nice breakfast and quiet sourroundings.The colour ,the style of the hotel and the decor are relaxing and pleasant.   Room Tip: Room with balcony See more room tips",0
My wife and I stayed in DeLight Boutique Hotel in early June 2015. It is so pretty and is located not far away from the town centre. The environment is no great that we enjoyed staying there so much. I must not forget to give a mention to the exceedingly good service from all the staff members. Sure to say that I will return to stay in Delight in the next visit.,0
"We had such a good time we are looking at reservations for later this year for a return trip. Hotel staff were efficient, attentive and very kind. The hotel was in an ideal location with fabulous views and excellent facilities.   Room Tip: A shady patio In late afternoon. Perfect for a glass of wine out of the sun on a hot day. Fab views... See more room tips",0
"Hotel location is not very convenient. You will need time to reach city center or remarkable beaches such as super paradise beach. bus service is available but stops by midnight. Very nice and friendly staff especially Fasili (Bill) and Katrina. If you looking for quite place, this is your choice.",1
"My husband and I were there for a destination wedding last week. When we arrived we were greeted by Maria who was so nice. She brought us to a beautiful reception area and served us lemonade while all the paperwork was being done. The view was beautiful. The rooms were gorgeous and big. Pool area was very nice. Having breakfast outside near the pool in the morning looking out on the water was wonderful. Food was very good. They did an amazing job setting up for the wedding. If you like walking make a left coming out of the driveway and walk until you see a dirt roadway, follow that up the mountain and you will see some amazing views.",1
"Ten days in this hotel was not enough! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were welcomed, looked after and enjoyed a relaxing tranquil time. The setting of the hotel is beautiful with stunning views of the sea. It was enough to make you feel relaxed and stress free from the get go. The staff are attentitive, friendly and polite. The room we had was a delux suite and was beautiful, clean and spacious. We were happy to chill out in the hotel but on the few occasions we ventured to the town or to onos beach the bus was quick and easy. If we were to return to Mykonos we would definitely stay at this hotel again! Thank you to all of the staff for a lovely stay!",1
"We were really choosy in finalizing our hotel in Mykonos and had done lot of research to finalize De.Light. Trust me we were not wrong. The welcome and Check in by Maria was super fast and she was courteous enough to take around the Hotel.The location is little far from main city but thats what we were looking for.The room is facing the entire Aegean Sea. This part of Mykonos is little silent and not like others with too much of tourists. Right opposite the Hotel there is a mini super market for basic stuff. The Breakfast is Al Carte and is one of the best and most fresh breakfast i have ever had. The Orange juice is to die for. The staff at restaurant was super friendly.Also room and housekeeping was 5 star rated. Right outside the hotel you get bus for all important destination.They other front desk girl called Katerina too was very helpful in finalizing excursions and ATVsAlso important point of free wifi - as suggested by some fellow travellers, we had absolutely no issue for wifi. it worked really wellall in all its one of the best hotels to stay in Mykonos if you want to avoid city feel.   Room Tip: get the room on 1st floor See more room tips",2
"If you can afford to splurge on the suite with a private pool, you won't be disappointed!!! We stayed on a weekday which had lower rates, but came to De.light a little spontaneously. We were a little disappointed with the original hotel we had booked and decided to find a more suitable 'honeymoon' accommodation. We ended up staying an extra night because we loved this place so much! The staff here is amazing, so incredibly friendly and helpful. The pool and dining area was spotless! The suite was gorgeous and the views are breathtaking! If we weren't already married, this is where I would pick for my venue! It's quieter than the rest of Mykonos, and away from the main tourist hubs, so it's really for couples that want to 'get away'. It can be a little tough catching a cab on this island, we ventured away once to check out Super Paradise beach and after a short visit decided we liked the hotel atmosphere and private beach better. We're ready to plan another trip back to the islands just so we can stay here again.",0
"Located in Agios Ionnnis which is a quiet beautiful area a ten minute bus ride from Mykonos town. The bus stop is directly opposite the hotel. Only 18 suites overlooking the beautiful bay which has the most amazing sunsets. The friendly helpful staff made this holiday for us which was really a crash out week so we were by the pool a lot. A lot of thought has gone into the design of the hotel and the outside pool/ sunbathing/terrace area is aesthetically appealing. Guests may also use the sun beds on the nearby beach, five minutes walk away, free of charge. There are two tavernas here the best being Hippy Fish which is famous as Costa's Tavern in the film Shirley Valentine. The food is absolutely delicious from the plentiful breakfast, continental or a freshly cooked, with freshly squeezed fruit juices- a rarity these days, to a lunch/ dinner menu covering a wide choice of dishes. They also have a small fine dining area decked out in black and white stripes under a canopy to the side of the pool. The chef provides delicious, imaginative food and I can really recommend the Greek Mille Feuille with yoghurt cream- a confection to die for.Rooms are spacious with king size beds which are cleaned in the morning and refreshed in the evening. We had room 11, which is a deluxe suite, a ground floor room with outside terrace, table and comfortable wicker chairs, We upgraded to this for a mere £15 per week extra and couldn't believe our luck. The bartender and outside waiting team all called us by name which is a pleasing personal touch and their service was first class. We will definitely go back.   Room Tip: All rooms overlook the sea See more room tips",0
"Beautiful grounds, amazing view and wonderful staff! The GM Anthony made our dream honeymoon come true! From the moment you walk in until the last minute you check-out you will be treated like royalty. My husband and I can't wait to go back with a longer stay! Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making our stay perfect.",0
"As we arrrived to De.light we had the warmest welcome we have ever had at a hotel. It did not stop there, staff was always available and were prompt at each encounter. Breakfast was more than we expect each morning with great service and custom breakfast to your liking. The staff was very helpful in booking excursions. We had no worries, everything was taken care of. The rooms were cleaned in the morning and refreshed in the evening. No complaints here! Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend!",0
"Fantastic rooms, wonderful pool, amazing breakfast. Food at hotel was great but quite location means that a car is helpful for going to other good places for dinner (a few restuarants are in walking distance but are very average). Mykonos town is an easy drive. Hotel is high standard and staff are super helpful. Would recommend to anyone. Wifi was temperamental at times but I'm being super picky now!",1
wow - this hotel is fantastic - the location is wonderful with Shirley Valantine beach just 2 mins walk away - the pool at the hotel looks over the sea if you prefer not to go on the sand. The rooms are spacious and all have amazing views of the sea - the stafff are extremely attentive to all your needs. Absolutely spotless. Food excellent - really can't recommend this hotel enough.,1
"I'll make this brief and quick. This is the place to stay when coming to Mykonos. Absolutely perfect EVERYTHING. THE hospitality is above and beyond. Thank you so much to everyone at De.light, we had an amazing time at your beautiful hotel and island!!",2
"Great hotel, great setting, great staff! Maria was a gem. She took care of our every need. John, Yanni, was wonderful. Just the right place for a quiet relaxing stay. Once you arrived you never wanted to leave!",1
"Our first hotel stay in Mykonos. The staff are very courteous and made our stay enjoyable can not fault the staff . Maria was fantastic she made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. She was kind enough to arrange a hire car for us. There is a bus stop just across the road which took us into town in around 10 minutes. A Restaurant across the road also another one within walking distance. The food at the hotel was plentiful especially breakfast. I'm not a breakfast person but they went out of there way to ensure my gluten free dietary requirements where met. The room was well maintained and very clean as was the rest of the hotel. All rooms have a sea view. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here except our room was noise. We stayed in room 20 it's next to reception and at night voices echo due to tiled flooring. Also alot of noise carried from the next room and upstairs, especially noisey in the morning. So if you like to sleep in and who doesn't on their holiday room 20 isn't for you. The bed was comfortable and large however the pillows where not comfy one was to hard and the other to soft. But other then that the hotel and staff are amazing.",2
"The hotel is beautiful and impeccably maintained they have beautiful furniture and the entire hotel is very clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was delicious served by the pool every morning with a beautiful view and relaxing music. the hotel restaurant was also delicious they have an amazing chef and bartender. the rooms are spacious, the bathrooms were huge not like usual small tiny European bathrooms and we had a gorgeous view of the ocean. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from town and we rented a car which the reception coordinated. Also the hotel has complementary beach chairs and towels at a local beach which is about a five minute walk. I loved this hotel, I actually liked it more than my hotel in Santorini which I paid three times more for. I would go back again and would definitely recommend!",0
"We had the pleasure of staying at the de.light hotel early September for 4 nights as part of a 9 day trip to mykonos. We booked cavo tagoo for the second half of the trip.And all I can say (with no disrespect intended to cavo) we wish we had stayed at de.light the whole trip.De.light breakdown:- poolIt is always easy to get a sunbed, good size, good bar service and a beautiful view over the bay- seaFive minute walk down to the beautiful beach and 2 beach side restaurants- restaurant on siteBreakfast was outstanding I was suprised it was included in our rate.Order anything you would like they cook everything fresh not buffet style, it was just superbWe ate lunch and dinner here a few times and were never disappointed. The chef bent over backwards to create dishes for me as I am a fussy vegetarian.Even when we left the hotel we can back for dinner one night as it really was that good.- roomsVery large, spacious, good size beds and very comfy, good size bathroom all very new furniture and decor-CleanlinessThe place is absolutely spotless and very quiet so we weren't bothered by anyone else. Often felt like a private villa. They would also keep the bar open for us at night as we eat very late and there were a few couples around to give some nice relaxed atmosphere.I know it is said a lot on trip advisor but the staff really make this hotel, I cannot stress this enough.They 100% made our trip and looked after us unlike I have ever experienced before. We travel a lot and it was so nice to feel relaxed and pampered by such a friendly team. The hotel should be really proud of their staff and the whole culture of the hotel.Look out for Alexander if you stay, he was outstanding. We will be back!! I wish we had stayed out entire trip this time..",13
"Delight is a great resort. The rooms and overall facility were very nice and the service was even better. We really enjoyed Alex in the restaurant and Maria in reception. They took wonderful care of us. We were also impressed that the restaurant chef came to our table to meet us the first night of our stay. We liked that the hotel was outside of the madness of Mykonos town but still close enough that we could get there for dinner and shopping when we wanted. However, the best meals we had on the island were right at the hotel. We also liked that there was a beautiful beach within walking distance. We liked Delight so much that we extended our stay by one night!   Room Tip: Some of the rooms have small showers with seats that take up much of the space. Request a room with...

"It has been a lovely week, at home life is busy De.light was a welcome break. Miss Maria you and your team have made our stay wonderful. From Mr 'dickie bow' Alex and his impeccable good manners and excellent service, to Mr Nickolas and his delicious Mojitos (quite possibly the best Mojitos I've ever had!).I've loved our daily call from Eva to ask what time we'd like turn down and her cheery smiling face every evening. My morning of pampering in the Sea of Spa was awesome.....I highly recommend a few hours in Maria's capable hands. All of the staff have been brilliant, smiling faces and giggles. The staff here are a credit to your beautiful hotel and they help make it what it is. Your little hotel is beautiful - stunning views of Delos and the crystal clear water that surrounds this beautiful island - perfect little pool side retreat with some funky tunes (the music has been brilliant !). Our fellow guests, you were also lovely....I did my best to keep it calm and tranquil but I couldn't contain my laughter at everything. The little ginger kitten that visited and wouldn't leave - we called him Terry - I think that was my fault talking to him at the bus stop every evening may not have been ideal! Cups of tea after chilly evening dips in the pool and delicious lunches all week. Thank you for a de.lightful stay. I can definitely say that I will be back, see you soon......",5

"I cannot sing the praises of this hotel too highly. The setting is magnificent. Our room was fantastic. The entire staff were courteous, attentive, efficient and friendly, and the service we received from them was first class. The food, both at breakfast and for the evening meals enjoyed by the poolside, was out of this world. The hotel was spotless throughout, with the swimming pool and it's loungers kept in immaculate condition.If there was just one negative, it was the lack of Wi-Fi access except within the reception area, but apparently this was beyond the hotel's control. Maria was very welcoming though whenever I felt the need to get on-line.The beach made famous by Shirley Valentine is just a short walk from the hotel with the choice of two tavernas fronting the soft sand. Hotel guests could enjoy free use of the loungers on the part of the beach in front of Pyli restaurant.We didn't bother renting a car or any other form of transport as the bus into Mykonos town stopped right outside the hotel and it costs only 1.60 euros for a single ticket.In conclusion, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone seeking a luxury escape on Mykonos.

"I'm almost reluctant to write this review as it's the kind of hotel you want to keep to yourself. Perfect location, wonderful staff for whom nothing is too much trouble, lovely spacious airy rooms, fabulous food especially the incredible a la carte breakfasts! We started every day with a feast served by smiling polite waiters and ended with delicious cocktails from their extensive list. Pink sangria is a must. Two gorgeous beaches both great for swimming within easy walking distance. Only problem was the wifi doesn't work except in reception. But with so much to enjoy who cares!",4
"We had an amazing stay at this hotel! The room was beautiful with a view of the ocean. Incredibly clean and well maintained. Very pretty small infiniti pool, at night with romantic twinkle lights. The included breakfast was very good and made to order, breakfast outside with a view. Most importantly every single staff member was incredibly friendly and beyond helpful, did everything they could to please and make sure our stay was perfect! Very happy we picked this hotel. Please note: this hotel is not in the centre of mykonos (which we were fine with). We rented a 4 wheeler to get around the island which I highly recommend, permitted us to go into town as well as visit 9 beaches.",1
"This place is absolutely fantastic. The room are great: spacious, neatly designed and all nicely positioned. The bar and restaurant are nicely set in the pool area. The restaurant is really worth it as one of the best food experiences on the island. The entire staff,whether at reception, at the bar, or spa are always keen on offering the best service. The small size of the hotel enables them to offer a completely taylored and exclusive experience. I loved the location: close to the main town but away from the crowded trendy beaches.",0
"We have been in Mykonos several times, I rarely write reviews however after my stay at De.light I felt obliged to do so. We had a lovely time, the staff is brilliant and the food is excellent. Their breakfast menu is revolutionary, I wish all restaurants would catch up with this - instead of attacking you with a mindless breakfast buffet, they have a carefully planned breakfast menu. Go check it out! They have a master chef, we loved having dinner there - great cuisine and completely relaxed. The De.light is walking distance to two beaches, I would say it's the best little boutique to completely relax looking at breathtaking sunsets and take a breather from all the partying. Thank you De.Light and see you next year!",0
"Splendid location , great service , the staff allways prompt and polite .The rooms and the premises are greek style, nice and clean.Superb breakfast and relaxing ambient.Beautiful swimming pool overlooking the sea. Private Beach with free beds.",0
"From the minute we checked in until the minute we checked out the staff made us feel like the only people in the hotel, friendly, kind and will bend over backwards for us.Rooms were immaculate and cleaned twice a day, with a little gift left everyday on our bed.This hotel made our stay in Mykonos 10 times better and we will 100% be returning.   Room Tip: stay at this hotel! See more room tips",0
"From all points of view Mykonos Grand is just perfect! The hotel design is modern and materials that were used in landscaping are of superior quality. We stayed in a premium room with sea view which I recommend especially those who want to enjoy the sunset every evening. Big bed and very comfortable helped us to have a good sleep and to recover from the fatigue accumulated during the day and night. Breakfast buffet was complete and the food from the pool restaurant very good. The staff at this hotel is absolutely the best, everybody was very helpful and friendly and nothing is impossible or too much for them, especially for the desk front ladies manager. Would be more superlatives to say about this hotel so, I recommend to don't hesitate to stay here, you will definitely have a perfect holiday!",1
We stayed in this hotel for a week as part of our honeymoon. We had an amazing sea view room with a balcony. The room was big and airy with a huge bath tub. The pool area was gorgeous with really comfortable sun loungers. Staff handed out little treats during the day such as mini creams and fruit with was a nice touch. Each evening in the rooms they left little presents like mugs and eye masks! I thought the food at the pool was slightly disappointing for the price. However the breakfast was amazing! Such a choice! The staff were always really friendly and made an effort to use your name where possible. We really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back some day.,0
"The hotel is great, the staff was super friendly and professional, the rooms were magic and with a fantastic view. The hotel goes from the hill to the beach, so you can enjoy of a beautiful view from your room as well as a private beach. The staff down in the beach surprise you regularly with little snacks such a cucumbers and ice creams, it's just paradise.The breakfast is included and is a delicious buffet, so you can enjoy your breakfast with the amazing view of the sea. It is a little far from town but they have buses that take you there, otherwise you can take a taxi for 10 euros or a private luxury car for 20.I really enjoyed my time there and I hope to come back soon",0
"Very good stay. Very nice staff. They took good care of us and drove me back to airport. I got very good suite but very very expensive, probably due to busy month. Rooms are comfortable, clean, elegant. I didn't experience the restaurant. Mykonos is always a good place to stay. Always rent scooter as there is almost no taxi available in the island.",0
"We had a perfect stay at Mykonos Grand Hotel!! The concierge, unfortunatelly I don`t remember her name, informed us about the best restaurants, places, beaches, ate rentals and everything else and made our stay perfect. They gave us a new room, with shared pool that was huge and very very beautiful. The breakfast was fantastic. The location is perfect and the hotel is very well maintained. The staff is the best, everybody was very helpful and nice. Marko Demertzis, that works at the beach, was very nice to us and did everything to please us. I would definitely come back to this hotel.",0
"This was the most luxurious clean and wonderful hotel. The food was fantastic, ate at restaurant every day for 4 days at the pool, prices decent, could not find a better meal. The staff at this hotel, bartender in the gorgeous lobby bar, pool staff, cleaning staff, front desk absolutely amazing. Felt so comfortable and pampered. Cannot wait to go back!

"Actually the very best hotel in Mikonos! Absolute perfection!Located on a quiet and silent beach with crystal clear waters in front of Delos island (with a daily breathtaking sunset in front of your eyes)the hotel is like a small hamlet of white cubes perched on a cliff. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, the quality of sleep absolute. Excellent restaurants. The tailor made service and the attitude of the whole staff are amazing. Nothing is impossible or too much for them. You can ask for something almost impossible and get it. It's really a home away home. Definitely a must go.

Great hotel with amazing staff. From check-in to pool to restaurant to spa. They were great. Great hotel amenities in the room and a shuttle bus at night to take you to town and back. Would recommend it,0
"We stayed at Mykonos Grand for our honeymoon in June. We can't say enough good about it. Beautiful room (we had the honeymoon suite), great breakfast buffet with almost anything your heart could desire, but best of all was the staff. Top notch group of people who can't do enough to make your stay relaxing and fun. The front desk staff is always ready with a good recommendation on where to visit, the breakfast staff was cheerful and ready with a latte , coffee, or mimosa, the shuttle staff was flexible and willing to drop you off wherever you needed to go, and the pool staff always knew just the right spot for the day. An amazing resort with the best staff in the industry. Thanks for making our honeymoon a memorable visit.",0
"This was our first stop during our Greece honeymooning trip and we could not say enough how grateful we are for the Mykonos Grand staff. When we arrived to Mykonos we learned our luggage actually didn't arrive with us. We were greeted at the airport by one of the MG staff who drove us back and he and the ladies at the front desk were beyond helpful with tracking our bags and we're absolutely thankful! We had far better service here than we have at any American hotel we have ever stayed at. They made our stay truly special. Our room was so relaxing with a balcony to look out at the ocean. I can't finish this review without giving a shoutout to Andreas at the bar ... We must have visited 10 different bars while in Greece and none of them were nearly as great as Andreas' bar. That man knows his drinks and it was a pleasure getting to drink a sample of his many cocktails while we were there. To the Mykonos Grand staff, we say salud.",0
"We had an amazing one week stay! Rooms well appointed with luxury and local flavor. Steam shower was a bonus. Great views of the crystalline Aegean Sea and Delos. Large salt water pool with nice day beds. Excellent, fresh (healthy if you want it) breakfast buffet included.With all of these positives, it was the superlative staff that made this hotel a home run for us! They said yes to everything and offered incredible professional and friendly service. Theo gave us terrific recommendations. And the entire concierge, front desk, and wait staff were great. Thanks to Georgia, Tonia, Maria, Valentina, Vicky, and the others.",0
"I have stayed at many hotels, very rarely am I as impressed as I was staying at Mykonos Grand Hotel!! From the second we walked in to the minute we left we were treated like royalty. After we took a fast plane from Athens to Mykonos, the airlines lost me luggage. I walked in stressed and upset. The girls at the front desk took over. Took al my paper work, made the phone calls for me. I had my luggage the next day. We sat down at the welcome desk and received a tour of the hotel. It is gorgeous!!! Next, the service at the pool, best ever!!! First the staff fixes your towel and your sun bed, next a little later you get a frozen wash cloth to help cool you down. Next you get a a little snack to cool you down. One day a fruit cup one day a little ice cream pop. At about 4:00 George walks around to clean your sunglasses!!  There are so many little touches the hotel adds to make this hotel so special. Every night during turndown service you are given a little gift. One night a passport holder, one night a case for your suntan lotion. All nice classy little touches. The breakfast buffet is amazing!!! Anything you want!! They will accommodate your needs.. The rooms are clean and beds so comfy!!! There are only 35 cabs in Mykonos.. So the hotel provides a free shuttle to the city every night. It only runs till 10:30PM which is a little difficult since the most dinner reservations are at 8;00- 10:00. So if you call the hotel they will arrange for you to be picked up. I recommend this hotel 100 percent!!! Enjoy!!",0
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel which is a short shuttle ride from the airport and Mykonos Town. We did not rent a car here but, instead, used public transportation to get around. Frankly, once you are at THIS hotel, you don't want to leave. Our room was very comfortable, had a wonderful view, and left me feeling like I didn't want to leave. The staff is very professional and accommodating, and the breakfast in the morning is wonderful at the main restaurant. I'm telling you...you won't want to leave.",0
"Superb Hotel deserves it's 5 star rating.on arrival at the airport we were collected by the hotels transport all the luggage was seen to by the driver.at reception we were booked in and taken for a glass of bubbly and told what amenities were available at the Hotel and about Mykonos town and restaurants we were shown to our room and all the suite cases were already there.we booked a superior sea view room with balcony the room was lovely and the views were fantastic especially the sunsets but the balcony was a bit disappointing very small you could only get a small table and 2 small chairs on it we were in room 223 . There were rooms with larger balconies that had sun loungers table and chairs would recommend asking for one of these larger ones but saying that the room made up for it the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic and the little touches like complementary sun hats and when the turn down service came in the evening they always left you a little present, very nice the staff were very attentive and nothing was to much bother. The breakfast was very good plenty of choices and I liked the way the Honey was served the actual whole honey comb was set up to drip into a tray very nice the restaurant looked out over the sea so having your breakfast looking out to sea was a very nice experience.we wanted to go into town one day so asked reception to book us a taxi the manager over heard us and offered to take us (what service) on another occasion we asked reception to recommend a restaurant in town not only did they phone and book it for us but they arranged for the restaurant to come to the Hotel and pick us up and bring us back when we had finished. I can't praise the Grand Hotel and it's staff High enough if you are thinking about a holiday in Mykonos i would head straight for the Grand Hotel O one other thing on departure they even took us back to the airport well done the Grand and the fantastic staff.

Excellent!It was a real pleasure Thanks to the friendly smiling and so helpful staff Amazing views from the room specially for the sunsetPerfect service at any timeLovely beach and excellent locatio,0
Booked Mykonos Grand for my husbands birthday via Booking.com had a fantastic room with a jacuzzi and extremely comfortable bed. The breakfast was yummy and the staff so lovely - love Greece for the people everyone is so happy and friendly. We spent a couple of days at the pool the poolside good is good with special touches. We went to beach clubs a lot though. We actually decided to stay a few days and the hotel was fully booked so we moved next door to St. John's. Luxury hotel book and enjoy,0
"My partner and I just came back from Greece where we stayed for 4 marvellous days at the Mykonos Grand Hotel. Our experience was very nice but...We have been welcomed at the hotel by a group of very dynamic and friendly people.The hotel was very clean with a nice view on the ocean. The service was very good, personalized and very attentive. Our room was very very very comfortable, large and spacious. All white with a big bath and an amazing shower equipped with a steam system. Incredible! Very calming. We booked a Superior Sea View room. The balcony was so small that can accommodate only 2 small adults. Really small adults! Really! But the view was spectacular.The included breakfast (buffet style) was also delicious but repetitive and served at the main restaurant that had a great view on the pool and the ocean. Still attentive service!The pool was big, clean and refreshing with also a great view, always sunny with full bar and lunch services and incredible bedding installation with umbrellas for a little bit of shade. Believe me, you need shade in Mykonos! We had an easy access to a narrow, small and very disappointing beach with a rocky water seabed. Chairs and full service were available. The beach at the Saint John Hotel (beside) was much better.The Hippie Fish restaurant just next to the hotel was great for lunch. Please reserve if you want to be seated ocean front.Let me manage your expectation in term of location. The hotel is at 15/20 minutes (depending traffic) by car to Mykonos Town. It is impossible to walk to the city. The hotel offered a shuttle bus with a very limited schedule (10:30 was the last bus back to the hotel), which does not match the Mykonos lifestyle. A 12:30 a.m. return would have been really appreciated. Because there are only 38 taxis on the entire island, I will let you imagine how easy it was to come back at the end of a great dinner!!!!On the other hand, the hotel is at 15 minutes walk to the Taxi Boat departure deck (Ornos beach) that brings you to all the famous Mykonos beaches. Small fishing boats. Not fast. Plan some time to get to your favourite beach. To get to Elia Beach, it took almost an hour. Great experience. A must!Overall it was a great hotel with a great service with great people helping and serving you everyday. If you want the live the full Mykonos vibe experience, the hotel might be too far because, it’s a real problem to be driven back to the hotel at the end of the night. There is an UberX kind of service that will cost you double fee. Very difficult to identify though.Suggestion: Captain’s restaurant at Mykonos Town was amazing. A must!",1
"We booked this as the second part of a two island holiday. The first was in Santorini, which was amazing, so we were nervous about how Mykonos would measure up.From the moment we arrived, we knew that we would not be disappointed as the hotel and its staff were incredibly welcoming and the location is also just perfect.Room was just as the photos depicted and every member of the team made an effort to talk with us and give advice on places to visit and eat etc.The hotel restaurant does a great breakfast, lunch and dinner, although we also like mix it up and sample the local restaurants. All the staff recommendations were spot on and we did not have a single disappointing meal whilst here.The entire team seem very happy, which says a lot about how the hotel is run.Would not hesitate to come back.",0
"My third time at the Grand for my summer holidays and for sure not my last!Perfect location, beautiful rooms with balcony or terrace to enjoy the Mykonos sunset, and the staff, vow, just great, from the welcome until drop-off at the airport it could not have been better. A warm thank you to them all, just to name a few Vicky at the breakfast and the White bar, Maria at breakfast and the pool bar and so on and so on! Thanks to all of you!",1
"A great hotel with lovely rooms and fantastic views. The pool is lovely and there are always plenty of fully serviced cabanas available by the pool, sun deck and beach. Although I wouldn't have thought of Mykonos as a child friendly place, this hotel ensured our kids were happy and didn't feel out of place. Great for families.",0
"Stayed in this hotel for 10 days.The hotel is built into the cliff face. This means all floors are on different levels but quite steep, elevators are available but the steps make it a great workout !!!The rooms are spacious, modern & very clean.The hotel staff are fantastic, very friendly & attentive.The swimming pool area is beautiful, big pool, jacuzzi, great sunbeds, umbrellas & spacious. A short walk down the steps you come to the hotels beach area. The beach is on the small size & stoney but great sunbeds & attentive staff. All sunbeds have fresh toweling sheets & a seperate beach towel for each user.The restaurants are very nice & serve superb food day & night.I will definitely go back to this hotel & recommend it, either for couples or families.We hired a car, which I would highly recommend as the hotel is 4.5km from Mykonos town & not advisable to walk as the local driving skills leave a lot to be desired !!!!!Overall definitely worth a visit & good value for money!!!   Room Tip: Room with a balcony is beneficial See more room tips",1
"We were very fortunate to be staying here for a week, the time just flew past. It's impossible to find anything negative to say about our stay. The staff are the most attentive, helpful and cheerful people you have ever met. Nothing is too much trouble, sincere committed service of the highest order. Room 10/10, spotlessly clean, comfortable and a very nice place to be. Everything worked, big comfy bed and a lovely sea view. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all top drawer stuff to saviour. Take the trip, you won't be disappointed!Wine list the only thing that needs some attention.",0
"This should be on your list of top hotels in Mykonos. Located a couple miles south of Mykonos town, the resort is beautifully located on a hillside overlooking the sea. You feel welcome with a private sit down greeting upon arrival. The staff is professional and friendly, offering useful advice for activities, excursions and restaurant recommendations. We celebrated our anniversary with a private sunset dinner on the beach that was perfect (thanks Maria!) Recommend booking in advance. Bar and meal services top notch. Courtesy shuttle to/from the airport or ferry docks. They offered to pick up our departure ferry tickets in advance so we wouldn't have to wait in line on the day of departure. The staff seemed happy and praised the Greek owner as a great boss who cares about them, the environment, and Greece. Nice to hear. No doubt when we return to Mykonos we will stay at Mykonos Grand.   Room Tip: Room 130 is closest to the pool, dining room, and spa. Nearest ATM (and grocery store) is at Ornos... See more room tips",0
"The Mykonos Grand is a beautiful hotel! Prior to arrival, we had arranged for transportation to/from the port/airport with the hotel. This made getting to the hotel very easy and comfortable. Check-in was extremely efficient - the hotel has enough front desk staff to make sure each guest checking in has their own staff member to provide suggestions/recommendations, give a tour of the hotel, and get you all checked in. Our room was beautiful, clean and simple. We had booked a room with an outdoor hot tub - which was nice to have, but due to the outdoor temperature, it was over the recommended temp most of the time we were there. The water felt like it would boil off your skin! The included breakfast was excellent. Get there early (or right before they close) to get a good seat. They had a great selection of pastries, eggs/bacon/etc, and even an omelette station. The white bar had an excellent bartender that we looked forward to visiting each night of our stay, upon our return from town!The front desk staff made great recommendations for things to do in Mykonos. We set up a car rental with them (highly recommend to get to all the beaches), and they found the exact car we wanted. The car was even delivered to the hotel so we could leave right from the hotel to explore the island! When asking for restaurant recommendations, make sure you tell the staff how much you want to spend - everywhere we ate was excellent, but a few were VERY expensive. The pool was nice and had servers to bring drinks/food if needed. Also, the staff came around to clean your sunglasses and pass out free ice cream as an added bonus. I was disappointed in the beach area - it was very small, only about 10-20 beach chairs on the beach - and those chairs filled the entire Mykonos Grand beachfront. The hotel offers a shuttle to take you to town at night for dinner/drinking. However, we were there in June - the latest shuttle picked up at 10:30pm. If you're going to Mykonos, you know it's a party town, and most of the bars don't get crowded until midnight. So having the last shuttle back at 10:30pm was WAY TOO EARLY!!! You could get a taxi back to the hotel if you miss the last shuttle - we waited about 30 minutes for a taxi around 1am. While it wasn't too bad of a wait, and it wasn't an expensive taxi ride - it was inconvenient.",0
"I had read some negative reviews about this hotel so wasn't too sure what to expect. This has been one of the best holidays I have had and this hotel exceeded every expectation. From our hostess Despina who was so friendly and informative, to all the other lovely ladies at reception who always had a smile on their face! The rooms were clean and spacious and towels were replaced twice a day. The waiting staff (Vangelis, Maria, Barbis, Costa...), the bar staff (Costa, Stavros..wish I could name them all here!) - every single member of this fine establishment are exceptional people. By the end of our stay we knew every member by name and they knew ours too! No request was too big or small, and the service was impeccable. Definitely on my 'to-do-again' list!   Room Tip: The sea-view room with a balcony was perfect, although a bit noisy from the neighbouring Hippie Fish... See more room tips",0
"What an amazing place! Forget the gorgeous property, fabulous breakfast and spectacular views... what really sets the Mykonos Grand apart is the service. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, every staff member went above and beyond to help make our stay amazing. For example, we mentioned to the front desk that we were going to pick up ferry tickets in town for our transfer to Santorini - no no! They insisted on going to pick them up for us. At the pool there were spontaneous ice cream treats, sun glass polishing mid-day and some very attentive staff ready to keep the drinks flowing. When they knew we were leaving early for the ferry, they took care of all our bags while we ate a quick breakfast. And everyone was super nice to boot! Would definitely recommend to anyone heading to Mykonos.",1
"A beautiful, very chic hotel with spacious hip rooms. The bathrooms are large and have an incredible bathtub. The service could not do enough for us and were warm and friendly. The views were incredible and the food was good, not great.The also have a van that takes you to and from town at night and a bus about a block away. I will return the next time I visit Mykonos.",0
"This was my third stay at the Grand in 10 years, and it continues to maintain their exemplary level of service and luxury. Their attention to detail, quality of staff and lovely rooms and amenities will keep us coming back year after year. I cannot think of anything or anyone negative we encountered during our entire trip. I can't recommend this property highly enough. Grand indeed!",1
"Hotel - The property is fabulous and beautiful. The lobby is large and inviting, the white bar has nice sitting outside with a beautiful view, perfect for an evening drink. There is a library which looks comfortable. But the best of all is the pool and the deck.Rooms - We had a Sea view room with a balcony. Nice size, comfortable bed, big balcony, nice views.Service - Excellent on all counts. The staff are polite and always smiling. A special mention to the girls at the reception. They helped us a lot during our stay by helping us plan our days with activities and suggesting restaurants. Dining - Breakfast was really delicious. The restaurant overlooks the pool and the sea which makes it a truly rich atmosphere. The spread is nice and had many options for vegetarians. Did not eat lunch or dinner in any of the restaurants so cannot comment. Spa - Amazing experience. We had chosen the body massage with hot shells. One of the most relaxing massages. Too good!! But please try planning and booking as they get full fast.Great job by Mykonos Grand team. You made our Mykonos holiday worth remembering.   Room Tip: Try to request a room with a private balcony. See more room tips",0
"The facility was perfect. The room was huge, the bathroom luxurious and modern. We got two rooms because we have two teenage sons. They gave us a secluded two-room unit with our private porch upstairs with a swing bed and jacuzzi. The hotel surprised us everyday with little gifts, including fedora hats and local liquor. Every staff in the hotel from restaurant to spa was courteous and professional. We had the ultimate relaxing time on the beautiful island of Mykonos with the bluest ocean you ever seen. P.S. The hotel got its own private beach.",0
"One week stay was wonderful. The entire staff were charming friendly and helpful. A credit to the management of this delightful hotel. Not to big, never felt crowded despite hotel being full. Always availability of sun loungers and tables in restaurant. The beach is right on the doorstep so great for either lounging by the pool or sea. The hotel food was good though there there are some fabulous restaurants in town or out and about the island (the hotel recommends some) The island is great and worth exploring with a mix of quiet remote beaches and crazy fun locations. No danger of mixing them up either (so no surprises) some bits like Paradise and super Paradise beaches are ultra crazy so know what you are getting. A very big recommend.",1
"My wife and I have just spent a week here. The hotel is absolutely spotless in every respect and the staff are a credit to the hotel as nothing is too much trouble for them. They are always happy and willing to oblige, whatever your request may be.There are plenty of comfortable sunbeds around the pool area and we were well looked after by the staff, especially Eleni.The rooms are a good size (we had a Premium Sea View) with fantastic views - garden view rooms do not have such a good view so worth going for a sea view.Housekeeping is first class and you are left small gifts every evening at ""turn down time"" - a nice touch.The breakfast is very good with a wide choice of hot and cold food etc and the staff are very attentive - special thanks to Maria for looking after us so well.The only negatives we could find are that the swimming pool is not heated and was very cold - there is no indoor pool. The beach was a disappointment as it is very small and not particularly inviting. There is a much nicer stretch of beach a few hundred metres to the left but it is quite difficult to access.The hotel is not really suitable for anyone with mobility issues as it is located on several different levels and the lifts can be quite complicated to work out as they only go to 1 or 2 levels then you have to change to a different one. We found the stairs to be the best option.The area immediately outside the hotel is very hilly so again not too good for anyone with mobility issues.The hotel coutesy bus operates to Mykonos Town in the evening but public buses are easy to access from the hotel and run every hour. (1.80 euro each way).These minor negatives are a pity because you will find the hotel and especially its staff hard to beat.   Room Tip: Go for a sea view. See more room tips",0
"We have just returned from a week at the fantastic Mykonos Grand and weren't disappointed. We stayed two years ago for our honeymoon and couldn't wait to come back. The hotel has had some refurbishment and was even better than the last time we stayed. The premium sea view room we were in was recently decorated, the bathroom was amazing and it had great room facilities. The staff are all friendly and welcoming and in on hand to make recommendations about restaurants to try in town. The shuttle bus is brilliant and makes visiting the old town very easy. There is lots of fantastic restaurants in the old time at very reasonable prices; try Maria's or Kostas for great authentic food.We will definitely be back again.",0
"My husband took me here for a special birthday this year and I have to say it's possibly the best hotel I've stayed in and I've done a fair amount of travelling. The staff are exceedingly helpful and smiley, the hotel is super clean, airy and beautifully kept and the location is simply idyllic. I can't fault the resort on any of the above.We spoke to a few couples who were a little older than us and some of them found it a little difficult to get around as the hotel is situated on a hill (like a lot of Mykonos) and built in to the landscape which is totally sympathetic to the environment visually and what makes it such a picturesque spot, but I can see that the trekking up and down the stairs both in the hotel and down to the beach/restaurants could be a little wearing if you're looking for something more easy going on your joints. Saying that, there are lifts in the hotel so the stairs can be avoided if you wish. The stairs didn't bother us - it was all good exercise!We felt the restaurant by the pool area, Aqua & Sole was vastly overpriced and not particularly special - Example, fresh Gyros should never cost €30 anywhere! essentially gyros is a kebab, need I say more. Thank heavens for Vasilikos, a Greek taverna in the nearby Ioannis which serves authentic Greek fare at a fraction of the price. We also ate in Mykonos town at a number of places that were all far better value than the hotel's option. Hippie Fish next door to the hotel and on the beach is a superb setting to watch the sunset, with excellent seafood and a decent wine list.If you're after some beach action, this isn't the place for you. The portion of beach that the hotel offers is small and overcrowded with sun beds. The water is crystal clear though. The pool area however is lovely and there are a few different terraces where you can sunbathe.Breakfast is amazing and it aims to please a lot of different tastes, there is literally everything you can imagine and all good quality stuff.Go to neighbouring Delos if ancient history is your thing, it's a lovely, interesting day trip.Overall we had a wonderful, relaxing week at Mykonos Grand and the staff make the experience all the more pleasant. Thank you : )",0
"This is a rather tough, tricky one to write as on the one hand there were both positives and negatives and on the other hand there were both negatives and positives so let me put it down like this:*The staff are informative, friendly and helpful if not a tad over-trained*Panos the Manager is efficient. Vangelis at Breakfast is a Star.*The setting is fab although frustratingly the beach and turquoise sea that the Hotel overlooks is for next door and to get to it you have to be a strong swimmer*The room we were moved to on our Second day was superb so why try to fob us off initially with a noisy not so nice room where we were awoken early as the pipework for next door's bathroom had no soundproofing. We were sent Wine & Chocolates*The lady who seats everyone at Breakfast appears friendly but has an implicit arrogance about her that personally I did not take to, again on the first day offering us the worse table to see if we would accept it. In the Service Industry remember the Customer is always right. I went and found my own table overlooking the Sea and she realized early on that I was not accepting second best*Breakfast is wonderful*The Pool Staff are highly efficient in fact I would say excellent*The Pool Area had no atmosphere and everything was grossly overpriced (try Hippie Fish along the Beach next door)*The Shuttle Bus into Town is a must Summing up, if you believe that by paying the most you get the best then stay here but if you want a cool vibe with atmosphere then best look elsewhere.   Room Tip: Make sure your Bathroom does not back onto another Bathroom as the soundproofing of the pipework is... See more room tips",3
"The hotel's facility and cleanliness are the best among our stay in Greece! Like the bathtub and open view very much! Highly recommended. We had sunbath for 2 days of our 3 nights there. There is a private beach and the service of sun bath there is very good. The breakfast is fantastics many choices with high quality. There is a con of the hotel, the restaurant there for dinner is quite expensive and you will probably find one cheaper in the down town. And the sunset there is blocked by a tree in the restaurant while you can have a better view of sunset in your room so there is no a problem.",1
"My wife and I came here 9 years ago when we first started dating...and now came back for our 1 year anniversary. The gore itself is beautiful. All of the rooms we saw face the water and are very large in size. The pool area is incredible with spectacular views of the seas. But what makes this hotel above and beyond all others is the level of service. Everyone of the staff is accommodating to your every need...and best of all, they are simply happy!!! Being in the service industry, I was curious how everyone could be so happy. So I asked...several staff members...and he answer was all the same, they truly love the owner of the hotel. He is apparently very down to earth and treats the staff like family. This certainly shows. We were wowed 9 years ago and were even more impressed this time around. Also the breakfast buffet in the morning is great. Just a great way to start the day!! I highly recommend staying here. It will make for a great trip.",2
5 star hotel with excellent staff. We were vey impressed by the service. One day we were stuck in downtown late night w/o any taxi available and I just called the reception and they immediaty sent a driver. Rooms and facilities are very good. Private beach is just ok.,2
"Recently returned from a week at this fantastic hotel. The whole property is beautifully kept, our room was wonderful and the staff were all brilliant. The beach is small but lovely and the pool and pool area are also beautiful. The views are specactular. The service was absolutely first class throughout our stay, including the regular shuttles into the town. Breakfast was plentiful and very high quality and the lunch menu was very good. We only had one dinner at the hotel and that was lovely. It's very rare we would return to any hotel, but there is no question we will return to this one.",5
"This is the finest hotel experience that we have had and we feel like we have found somewhere that we will visit time and time again. We've stayed in many five star hotels around the world and experienced a lot of great service, but the hotel and people here take the number one spot.We took a quick taxi from the airport and arrived in heaven. The lovely Anna welcomed us to the hotel and took us through lots of information about Mykonos and the hotel/resort before showing us to our room. Her warm welcome assured us that we had chosen the right place to come. The room was so nice and spacious, fitted out with style and comfort; the bathroom was a real highlight with great quality fittings and a super shower. The daily cleaning of the room was flawless, thanks to Katerina for all of your care and attention.On our first full day, we booked a couples massage, hoping to be reinvigorated after a long and tiring winter - we were not disappointed! The ladies in the Spa listened to our needs and guided us in choosing the right treatment. The massages were amazing and we left the spa feeling renewed in mind, body and spirit. Thanks to Anasthasia, Maria and Athenesia. All three are lovely ladies and became like old friends as the holiday went on. After only 3 days of our holiday, we knew that the 7 days we had booked was not going to be enough in this wonderful resort. Fortunately, the manager Panos was able to accomodate our request to extend our stay to 11 nights!!Our days at the Mykonos Grand passed in a delightful dream, and the evenings in Mykonos town were great fun, courtesy of the hotel's shuttle bus. Even if the bus was missed, or we wished to stay later in the town, a cab was only ten euros.The hotel's restaurant is fantastic. At breakfast time it has every choice imaginable, and the warm welcome always got the day off to a great start! Maria, Fillipo, Vagelis and many others made it feel like visiting a family home. The other manager, Theo, was always on hand with a friendly smile and greeting. By night, the same place becomes the most romantic setting - with superb food, music and service overlooking the Aegean Sea. The lobster spaghetti was so good that I had it twice during my stay!Thanks again to everybody at the Mykonos Grand for your hard work and unforgettable hospitality...we cannot wait to see you all again!!PS. If you are a yoga-lover, like my wife, then you won't be able to get enough of practising yoga and meditation in the amphitheatre overlooking the most amazing view and Delos...",4
"Mykonos Grand was a wonderful experience. The rooms are spacious and have amazing views. The pool area is so luxurious. The staff makes sure you are well taken care of without being in your face bothering you. They bring frozen towels, and sorbet and will even put sunscreen on your face and clean your sunglasses with white gloves. It's unbelievable! The resort also provides a complimentary shuttle into town, which is great so you get the seclusion at the resort but the ability to get out. Would definitely go back.",4
"This is probably the best hotel i have ever stayed in with regards to service. The staff are like a family and you are there guests. Everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. It wasn't just the normal service they did superbly but the little things as well, like the little gifts we received every night and also all the staff knew our daughters name after only telling them once. The room was very spacious and much bigger than expected. The location is really good with great views and quiet but also close enough to local shops. i would definetly recommend this place and can't wait to go back.",4
Just arrived back from a truly fabulous stay at the Mykonos grand Hotel. Our stay was absolutely faultless and would highly recommend....( currently planning out next trip back to Mykonos grand) The staff were amazing and made our stay unforgettable. We have stayed in lots of five star resorts around the world but nothing compares to the exceptional service that the staff provide here. The staff really couldn't do enough for us and we're always so happy and friendly. The management team should be vey proud! Our room was a newly refurbished premier sea view room (219) which had great views of the sea and the sunsets were spectacular. The bathroom facilities were great; A lovely free standing bath and shower were superb. The l'occitane toiliteries were a nice touch too. Our room was cleaned to a really high standard daily.Pool and beach both stunning! Breakfast at the hotel was delicious too with an excellent variety. A hotel shuttle bus operated in the evening to and from the hotel to town ( takes 10mins) which was really handy for the evening. Can't recommend this hotel highly enough... Amazing! <U+2764><U+FE0F>.,0
"The review from Neal just about sums everything up as we were there at the same time,we couldn't fault our room and the service received starting from the lovely guy who picked us up from the airport and the wonderful Georgia who was our first contact when checking in, she always suggested lovely restaurants and offered to make our reservations ,we spent late evenings in the bar with Andreas, and fantastic coffee in the mornings from Fotini and Maria in the restaurant the breakfast selection was always lovely with plenty of choice, the pool staff were amazing and the sun beds were the best I have ever used in a hotel. The management were always on hand and available, especially Theo,I was sad to leave and will definitely be back",2
"This was our honeymoon and wow, did they look after us. The service from every member of staff was outstanding and we could not have wished for a better stay. The view and sunset are one of many appealing factors of this well run and superbly presented hotel even though our stunning suite has not been decorated for three years, we felt it was all brand new. All areas from the rooms to public areas are stylishly designed and presented. Staff to note are Andreas in the cocktail bar who's claim of making the finest cocktails in Europe is a fair one. Fotini in the restaurant will have you in stitches with her banter and welcome chat. The management go out of their way to ensure your stay is one to remember and they certainly succeeded with us. It was a holiday to remember for years to come for all the right reasons.   Room Tip: The building is on many floors with lifts to each apart from the lowest floor and beach access See more room tips",3
"This place is hard to beat if you have come to Myconis to just hang out. And if you want to instead wander about the island, it makes a great base. I have not visited a lot of beach resorts but I suspect this would always be a favorite.",0
"When we looked at booking the Grand our main worry was that it was about 4km from Mykonos town. After staying there Id say it could have been on the moon and Id still want to go back. The town vs beach dilemma was a non issue in the end, there is a shuttle bus that worked very effectively and we went into town a number of times for dinner using this service. So the hotel itself. Well I didnt meet a single unfriendly person in Greece but the Grand has a collection of the nicest people youll meet. From the moment you walk in you just feel relaxed and happy. Reception isnt staffed by a bunch of surly disinterested people but rather by a bank of smiling ladies that welcome you home like a long lost friend every time you see them. This extends to the staff throughout the hotel. The managers are very hands on, always stopping by to have a chat and see that youre happy but never intrusive. The hotel has wonderful amenities, the bar is amazing, the library incredible, the restaurants were wonderful. Theres a small beach with attentive staff sorting out everything. When my cocktail got blown over by the wind a man was right there replacing it instantly. The room itself was nothing short of incredible. We've been doing a bit of a comparative tour of presidential suites and this one was as good as any.Beautiful views, wonderful pool - but not heated- about the only tiny quibble we had but we were there in early May, probably not relevant later in the season. There were little thoughtful gifts each night, 2 studies, 2 bathrooms, steam room, multiple seating areas and a magnificent hanging bad next to the private pool. One thing that deserves a special mention is the room cleaning staff. Its always tedious when your room isnt made up till 2pm and you return to find the staff still cleaning. At the Grand they clearly have some sort of telepathy thing going because our room was beautifully made up when we not there every single time, even when we had an early breakfast. And again at night. Ive never seen anything quite so efficient, it was truly impressive. All in all an amazing 4 nights holiday. Completely relaxing, we absolutely loved it.",3
"If you asked me what I remember first about the stay at the hotel it would be Maria & Fitopini! However, it would not be doing all the other staff members of the hotel justice as they are all truly special in their approach to customer service and making guests feel at home!! The newly renovated rooms are excellent, the location is quiet and the cleaning staff are absolute treasures too! If I had to make one recommendation to management, it would be to offer a more sophisticated in-room dining menu in the evening. Whilst Mykonos town has many extraordinary places to eat, guests may not want to go out every night but enjoy to relax the 'quiet' and beautiful sunset from the balcony of their rooms. All in all however a great place to entirely relax!   Room Tip: Renovated rooms are superb! See more room tips",2
"We have to say that this is an exceptional hotel. We arrived at night and Ms Despina was expecting us very nicely for us to do a Private Check in (that is, away from the front desk in very comfortable chairs and with a glass of champagne) she explained all the perks of the hotel and gave us several recommendations on things to do in the Island, gave us a minitour of the facilities also. Our room was on the third level with a balcony and a espectacular view of the Aegean Sea. It is a completely new room with bathtub, separate shower, a king sixed bed, couch, very roomy! We were welcomed with a bottle of Mastic a local liquour and sweets. There were available music speakers, all kind of cables and adapters to plug in appliances (technology kit), for those who may forget that at home. Every day when we came back at night we would find a little gift in our room: mugs, travel pillows, among others. Breakfast is served in a very pretty restaurant with a great view of the pool and sea. All kinds of options, smoothies, eggs by the order, pastries, etc.. The pool is big enough, and the beach is private with umbrellas and sunbeds available just for guests. The staff is absolutely friendly and helpful. Ms Despina and Mrs Suzy were very great with us, they helped us get ferry tickets from a travel agency, were very good to us. Location is a bit away from Mykonos Town, about 10 min by car, but it is very quiet and relaxing. We rented a car at the airport and was great for knowing the island. The facilities are all new and clean and beautiful. Our only complaint is that we couldnt stay more days!! 100% recommended!!",2
We stayed here last summer and it was so memorable. The room looks great and has a wonderful view on the sea. Thevery days we spent by the pool were wonderful and there was always some staff member making sure we were fine. We will return here.,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Mykonos Grand last year and have wanted to go back ever since. Our room was lovely and was cleaned at every opportunity. Towels were constantly restocked and any other requests you needed, they were attended to. The staff were always friendly and greeted us consistently. The beach wasn't one of the best but if you travel a few minutes up the road, they have some amazing beaches. Great hotel. We will definitely be returning.",2
We stayed here for 6 nights May 2015 and we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing. The pool is gorgeous with a breathtaking view of the sea. The service is outstanding especially by the pool. Nothing was ever too much. On hot days they handed our ice cream and on slightly cooler days they handed out hot chocolate. They even came to clean our sunglasses daily. They really thought of everything. Breakfast was lovely although a bit repetitive but thats my only criticism! I'd 100% return!,1
"We stayed at the Mykonos Grand last summer in a Premium Sea View room. The room itself was excellent with a great view of the sea itself - great for sunsets. The room was quiet and we never had any problem with noise from other guests. Our days were spent by the pool where there were always 2-3 staff members doing the rounds to get you whatever you need, and the team from the spa pop round once a day and can offer massages, etc. The only problem is it can feel very hard to relinquish your deck chair by the pool and go exploring!The food at the hotel is great and we enjoyed breakfast every morning and lunches by the pool. However, my one criticism is the dinner menu which never changed so we only felt we could eat dinner at the hotel a couple of nights. FYI next door and 50 metres down the beach is another hotel / restaurant which also is well worth a visit. Great fresh fish every day.Probably the greatest asset is the hotel's staff. To a man or woman they are all very friendly, highly attentive and really make you feel at home. All in all, then, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Mykonos Grand. It's a really great way to enjoy your stay on the island.",0
"We spent our 25th wedding anniversary here, the staff were amazing, they made our anniversary so special, dinner on the beach, breakfast in bed and rose petals with candles when we returned to our room in the evening.The dining is first class coupled with a very relaxed atmosphere... From start to finish, excellent",0
"This is one of my favourite hotels which I will return to again this summer. Absolutely focused on customer satisfaction. Spectacular sunsets and sea view each day from our room, luscious rich breakfast, reception will take care of almost every problem or queries. Although its more of a hotel for family with teenagers or no children, the hotel is quite child friendly. We had a problem with loud TV all night coming from lower floor but the managament did everything they could to solve the problem. The beach is first come first serve and not too big but pleasant. The beach could be improved more for a hotel of this level. Food was fabulous, location is perfect but we had a car. Its a quiet area of Mykonos so it was perfect for us to rest all day by the pool or down at the beach yet go out all night in the bustling town center. Recommend this fully.   Room Tip: Higher floors have the sea view and only get the seaview. See more room tips",0
We stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon. The hotel is beautiful. Our room was huge with a private pool!! They had the best breakfast I have ever had. Everything was so fresh. I would def stay at this hotel again. It was in walking distance from few beaches. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful.,1
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Mykonos for five nights during our honeymoon in October, 2012. The hotel was absolutely spectacular and luxurious and we loved staying on this island.The hotel grounds were truly breathtaking. Our room overlooked the ocean and every night we enjoyed a drink on our balcony and watched the sunset. The white-washed buildings are what you expect when you travel to Greece, but it was even more beautiful than we imagined. The pool was beautiful, but a bit chilly, and the views were amazing. It wasn’t exactly an infinity pool, but was nice. There was a great beach with comfortable chairs and umbrellas as well close by.The service was excellent. The staff was very kind and accommodating. When we arrived, we were given a tour and encouraged to come to the staff with any requests. There were small gifts in our room every night from goggles to ouzo. Additionally, there was a complimentary shuttle into town for dinner every night. I believe there were two time choices. Every morning there is a large breakfast buffet with complimentary food and drinks. The food was ok, but the view was amazing. Lunch and dinner at the hotel is a bit pricey. We only ate at the hotel once. We favor trying the local grub so the restaurant at the hotel wasn’t as appealing for us. The hotel was in a more remote area and because we were there off season, it was quiet which was perfect for us. The nearby beaches were relatively empty and we hardly had to wait for restaurants. I would highly recommend the Grand Mykonos and will definitely be returning some day!",0
"My wife & I visited this hotel on our second honeymoon & what an experience we had! The day we arrived, we had an ""incident"". A very serious one which was our fault. We had just started our honeymoon & from that moment we thought it was going to be a disaster. I prefer not to list the details. However considering what happened, I Can say that the hotel took care of the situation in an unimaginable way. From laundering all of our belongings to moving us to another suite, and most importantly continuing to treat us as if nothing had happened with EXCELLENT SERVICE & Respect was something we weren't expecting. Thinking back to the amazing time we had there, I felt obliged to write this review. I Highly recommend this hotel. From the Awesome pool, the Breathtaking VIEW, outdoor bar/Restaurant (which was also fabulous), Clean & Luxurious Rooms, Worth every penny. Its Truly a positive experience. THANK YOU MYKONOS GRAND HOTEL.   Room Tip: its a smaller hotel so all rooms are accessible. Be sure to book a ""Renovated"" room. Might... See more room tips",0
Awesome pool with view and outdoor bar/restaurant. Staff had great recommendations for us for things to do in Mykonos even though the weather wasn't perfect during our stay. Quick cab ride to town and to the many beaches of Mykonos while far enough away from noisy areas. The hotel itself is very clean and luxurious. Huge breakfast buffet included in the room fee that was delicious. Good value for the cost of the room overall. I would stay here again if my travels bring me back to Mykonos and recommend to a friend.,1
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in August and really enjoyed it. It's across the street from the beach and has excellent views. We sat on our private balcony at sunset and enjoyed a bottle of wine while a warm breeze caressed us. We had room service bring us dinner and it was the best meal we had in Greece. We rented an ATV, which was delivered to the hotel, which was very convenient.",2
"I recently spent 3 days with my wife while in Mykonos at Mykonos Grand Hotel and had a very positive experience and would recommend this hotel. What separates this hotel from the other are the folks working at the property. As a frequent traveler I have become quite picky with service and this team did not miss a beat. Most notably was Suzie who greeted us upon check-in and found me not just any doctor on the island to help with an ear infection, but the best ENT probably in Greece. I will forever be grateful to her and only wish I got to than her in person. The other members of the front desk were all just terrific. I am bad with names, but am confident that giving them all a shout out would be appropriate. Thank you for this a memorable trip for my wife and I and we hope to come back again.",0
"This is the only hotel I have ever been back to 3 times. Came back late September with my daughter for ten days of heaven. It's always a little worrying when you have been somewhere amazing as you wonder whether they can live up to your high expectations. Of-course I need not have worried as everything was as perfect as ever. So lovely to see all the same faces and the service was as impeccable as always.My favorite hotel in Greece, by a mile.   Room Tip: Sea view suites are amazing, if you can stretch to it but all sea view rooms are of a really high st... See more room tips",2
"Mykonos is a great place to visit....only to either stay at a fine resort of to visit (highly recommended) the nearby island of Delos (which is simply amazing). We stayed at the Mykonos Grand, and it IS a beautiful resort, with a magnificent pool area and a very nice sandy beach. We spent all of our time on the beach and in the sea, which was wonderful. Professional, very friendly staff, a great breakfast buffet....and our only disappointment...no traditional Greek food! There menu for dinner is a fine ""international selection"" of things that you might fine in New York or London, but we love to go to Greece for Greek food. This is a large resort, but several elevators and very nice paths make it a relaxing stay. The rooms are not overly large, but ours with the indoor steam shower and exterior shower was nice.   Room Tip: Get a room with the terrace attached (our was shared with another room upstairs, not terrific) See more room tips",1
"Myself and my Husband stayed here in September for 7 nights on our Honeymoon and we HIGHLY recommend staying here to anyone.It really was amazing, the food, the rooms, the pool...pure perfection.I manage hotels myself and I was blown away by the staff at this hotel, they really could not do enough for us, very friendly and they really make the place.The hotel shuttle bus and the free gifts every evening are magic touches.   Room Tip: Rooms on floor two have incredible balcony views See more room tips",3
"My wife and I were at the Grand for 4 unbeliever night. Nothing but exceptional service from the front desk to the pool attendees. Although the resort has a small beach the rest of the facilities make up for it by far, from the amazing infinity pool. Only mistake is that we had to leave.",1
"Incredible! Stunning resort, amazing views of Delos and the beach.The hospitality is unmatched. From the moment you arrive they treat you like royalty:.All excursions can be booked through the concierge.You can also spend the day at the gorgeous pool which has an amazing view, hot tub, great pool restaurant and steps down to a cute beach.Georgia at the front desk spent 45 minutes going over the map of the island and showing us around the property. The room was exquisite with a balcony facing the sea and pool, a tv and even adapters and cables for electronics. The property is spotless and stunning. The breakfast buffet is huge and gorgeous, facing the ocean. They have tennis squash movies and a library. Great for honeymoons or friends trips.Food at the restaurant is great and the resort includes a free shuttle to and from town. Also renting am AtV is a great way to see Mykonos! .",1
"This is by far the best place I have ever stayed. From the cleanliness to the service to the amenities, there is nothing we couldn't fault.When we arrived for our honeymoon my husband was quite sick and only got worse. The hotel staff were absolutely fantastic during this difficult time from arranging for the doctor to come and see him, picking up medication and making sure we were looked after the whole time. They even organised to bring me some lunch when they found out we would be spending many hours at the medical centre.The room was spotless everytime we came back and the housekeeping staff would always leave us a little gift.There is no need to go anywhere, you have everything you need at your disposal from the beautiful pool, beaches and restaurants.Book this hotel now - you will not regret it!",1
"There is not enough room to write about all the greatness this place has to offer. We have stayed in hotels all around the world and this ranks in the top 5 EVER. The Service was PERFECT, the room was Amazing (we had a balcony) The food was fantastic. The view, the pool, the grounds,... all just perfect. I cannot think of one thing bad to say. Stay here, you will not regret it.   Room Tip: My suggestion is to step up and get a balcony room See more room tips",2
"Beautiful set up, Excellent food, splendid views, very clean and well maintained rooms and facilities, very friendly, welcoming staff always going a step further to make you feel special. The management definitely has the right recipe here...We wanted a peaceful relaxing holidays: that was achieved! ! We will be back, for sure....",1
"This was our second visit to the Mykonos Grand having last stayed in September 2014. We loved this hotel so much we could not wait to return.Arriving at Mykonos airport and being greeted by the hotel shuttle is such a bonus. We were at the hotel in less than 1 hour from our plane landing, brilliant. Arriving at the hotel to such smiling faces and Champayne says it all.This year we booked a Premium Garden room and the moment we entered the room we realised it was a great choice, it was beautiful. Although there is no sea view the room more than made up for it with a nice terrace that you can sit and have coffee in the morning.Having arrived lunchtime our first port of call was the Aqua e Sole to be greeted by all the staff that remembered us. We absolutely love eating here, the setting is lovely, the food great and the staff are the best. We ate here everyday. My husband loved having a little banter with the lovely Fotini everyday and all the other staff members were so welcoming.Around the pool Eleni and the guys did such a fabulous job that it was a pleasure to be there. In the White Bar Andeas and Vicky were again a pleasure to be served by.The staff at the Mykonos Grand really do make this hotel, they enjoy their jobs and really appreciate and respect the owners of the hotel. This comes across everyday by everyone you meet and you can understand that it is genuine and the reason the hotel is so special.I could go on and on but I already have one review that says it all.Thank you Mykonos Grand for making our holiday wonderful. We will be back.   Room Tip: Premium Garden rooms are lovely See more room tips",1
"The Grand was a short stop for us after sailing on a private boat in Turkey...we were sort of wishing we went straight home bt after we arrived at the hotel and checked in to the beautiful accomodations, we were so HAPPY!

The hotel Manager, Nikos... and top waiter/ server, Costas, front desk, Tonia, Georgia and just about everyone was outstanding and hospitable.

"We loved staying at the Mykonos Grand. The set up is reminiscent of a classic Greek hill village, with the rooms and amenities arrayed up the mountainside right by the seashore, with fantastic views and ambiance. Our room was a ""sea view"" and was terrific in every way -- clean, roomy and with outstanding vantage. The facilities were outstanding and the place was well-spaced and maintained. Most incredible of all was the service -- I've had the privilege of visiting over 40 countries, and I've never experienced service that was more attentive, responsive and helpful -- whether we were in the restaurant or making inquiries at the front desk. One of our best vacation choices ever!   Room Tip: Higher is probably better. See more room tips",1
"Mykonos was the 2nd stop on our Greece trip for our 30th anniversary. If you want a quaint but beautiful 5 star experience, you need to visit Mykonos grand.Rooms are very nice. Leave your patio windows open at night for a wonderful sleep without the noise of air conditioning (at least in September ). Beach is down a winding stone path. Attendants will get chairs towels etc for you. Pool was to die for. Very comfortable and the staff brings iced towels to cool you down! Food was fantastic. While we didn't have dinner, the breakfast buffet was certainly one of the best we have ever had. Note the fresh honey dripping from a freshly cut honeycomb! Lunch from the pool bar was great as well I can only hope that we make it back here some day. A true slice of heaven",1
"Just a one night stay for us, sadly (due to mucked up travel plans), but would have loved to stay the week. What a stunning hotel, incredible staff, facilities and decor. We loved the touches of the welcome drink in the room and branded baseball caps. Hugely comfortable beds. And the steak at the Dolphins of Delos restaurant (what a view!) was incredible. Highly recommended.",1
"The Manager and his team are amazing the staff is extremely professional. The accommodation is excellent, the atmosphere was incredible calm. Reality looked even better than the pictures.I recommend this hotel warmly. We will come back soon.",0
"This hotel is amazing! Great beach, great views and great staff! We had the ocean view room for our stay and the garden view room for one day since they didn't have availability for the same hotel room for the duration of our stay. We knew that at the time we booked but knew we wanted to stay here after reading the reviews. The breakfast was great and the hotel restaurant was great but a bit pricey. We ate at the hotel restaurant for dinner one day but went into town for the other days. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service into town and back and also informs you of the public bus schedule. The ocean view room was a big room with huge bathroom, personal steam room, nice rain shower, and lots of closet space. You also get an infinity pool on your balcony which you share with your neighboring ocean view room. The infinity pool was amazing. The sunset from the ocean view room balcony was better than viewing the sunset in Oia in Santorini. The hotel helped us arrange ATVs for a couple of days which helped us get around the island to some of the beaches we wanted to see during our stay. Great experience at the hotel! We were sad to leave.",2
"Outstanding resort- The General Manager, Panos and his team are truly amazing, from the pool staff, waiters, waitresses, porters, housekeepers, the lovely lady who cooks eggs in every variety for breakfast, to the wonderful concierge especially Suzy who even gave me her own reading glasses to keep when i admired them. Food, rooms, location, service first class. Going back next year.",1
"Stayed for a week in September, from the minute we arrived until we left the staff could not do enough for you, from Suzy and all the girls on the front desk to Savvas and Nicko by the pool who really did not stop all day not just looking after us but everyone around the pool always with a massive smile on their faces, thanks for looking after us! You get daily treats, mini ice creams, mango sorbet, frozen flannels to mention a few, our room was on the top floor as requested and was clean and modern, fantastic views, the beds and pillows were so comfy, I wanted to bring a pillow home!! The breakfast was adequate and tasty, you are located at the top of a hill but I used our hire car or used taxis so it wasn't a problem.All in all I would recommend this hotel and when I return this is where I will be staying.",1
"Great location, very cleanrooms, large pool and very nice people. Very helpful and hospitable will go again. The rooms was large and the breakfast was yum. Their beach restaurant offered a 10% discount to eat so that was great.",0
"The Argo hotel is our favourite hotel when staying in Mykonos. Great location, service and above all staff that make you feel at home. The owner, Mr Thanasis, owns one of Mykonos best restaurants nearby with excellent local dishes using fresh salads. His traditional Mykonian salad uses a green seaweed which has an incredible flavour. We have been going to this hotel for the past 8 years and have noticed a constant umprovement in amenity. This hotel is great value for money and highly recommended when staying in Mykonos.",0
"We can not recommend the Argo enough, from the airport transfer to the gorgeous greeting on arrival the amazing staff,with a big mention to Vicki at reception who was super gorgeous and nothing was a problem, from hairdressing appointments to booking our ferries she was amazing. The location is absolutely perfect 200 meters from the beach and the bus stop into Mykonos town almost at the door. Breakfast was perfect, damn that rice pudding was good with the owner approaching us a few times to say hello and make sure all was good. The pool was cold, deep and perfect. Book well in advance for this gem as you do. Not want to miss out on a room here. Thank to everyone at Argo you were positively fabulous kiss kiss and another kiss from us Sharon and Eleni",0
There's not really anything else to say! Whether it's the fact you're in Mykonos or the hotel decor of clean and crisp blue and white sums up everything you know about Greece. This was our favourite hotel in all of the Greek islands. It's a bit of a hike from all the clubs but worth the walk because taxis don't seem to exist early on Saturday nights!,0
"What a fabulous hotel in Mykonos! Right on Platys Yialos beach and a short walk to the beautiful Psarou, you couldn't ask for better!Staff are local, and really care about their guests and their experience on the Island. Unfortunately, people like this are becoming increasingly hard to find on Mykonos! They are true gems. We had a sea view room on the top floor with direct views out to the sea/pool area. It was large and lovely! Great, modern facilities with a beautiful balcony. The breakfast was more than adequate and we enjoyed it each morning before heading out for the day. Pool is large and very clean. We were also provided with transport both from the airport and to the port at no extra cost which was a fantastic bonus! As a side note, there is a local bus which goes to and from the town (takes about 10-15 minutes) almost outside the hotel. So useful, and runs every 30 mins or so.Overall an amazing experience! We highly recommend.   Room Tip: Direct sea view rooms are the best for views. See more room tips",0
"Just returned from a one week vacation in Mykonos and could not have asked for a better hotel. Close to beach, bus stop outside the hotel which you can take to go into the town or other beaches, Breakfast was plentiful and a wide variety to select from. Staff friendly and would go out of their way to assist no matter what the enquiry was about.",0
Hotel Argo was the ideal hotel for my family and I and catered to all our needs.The staff were friendly and only to willing to assist us.Located close to the beach and restaurants was very convenient for us.,0
"I've been coming to the Argo for 15 yrs. firstly, the hospitality is superb! Always a warm welcome. We got picked up from the port. Got a room with a beautiful view of Plati Gialos Beach. The bus stop is about 20 steps away from there hotel so you can conveniently get to Town. Morning breakfast over looks the hotel pool. Overall, a really nice hotel and comfortable stay. Don't forget to go to the hotels sister restaurant ""Avli tou Thodori."" Also exceptional food and service!",2
"We have just returned from a 2 week family holiday at this super, small, friendly hotel. It is perfectly located a 2 minute walk from the beautiful beach at Platys Gialos and the bus into Mykonos Town stops just outside which takes approx 10 minutes. Our family room was immaculately clean and furnished in a minimalist style and right next to the lovely pool. The staff are great - from Susannah at breakfast with her great smile and Vicky on reception - nothing was too much trouble. Wifi was quick, breakfast was delicious and airport pickup makes this hotel the perfect choice for a stay in Mykonos. Would highly recommend.",0
"The Argo offers everything you would need. I have never stayed in a 2 star hotel before but after friends highly recommended it and considering the excellent reviews, we booked it for 4 nights in June. We were 4 adults and 2 children staying in a family room and double room. The rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. The staff were always very courteous and helpful and I'd like to say a big thanks to Vicky who answered so many questions in the run up to our stay. The pool is the biggest plus - we had a dip every afternoon and enjoyed the delicious cocktails made by Kosta. We also ordered food many times from their restaurant on the beach Avli Tou Thodori which was delicious. Breakfast was very good and Susanna was always on hand to help. We hired a car through one of the companies the hotel recommended and they were by far the cheapest. They didn't charge for car seats and they dropped off the car at the hotel making them much better than any of the big names at Mykonos airport.We cannot wait to visit again one day!",1
"The room was lovely, nice and clean with a cute balcony, the fridge worked and the safe was secure. Our bathroom was neat and sufficient. The breakfast area and pool were divine. Susannah, a member of the staff, was fantastic, super friendly and helpful. She made every effort to talk to us and engage with who we were and where we were from, always interested in hearing what we had to say and in helping us with any queries or requests. She made me my frappe as soon as she saw me walking down to breakfast. Breakfast was excellent. Overall, a wonderful and friendly place which i would recommend to anyone.",0
"Just returned from seven nights at this lovely hotel. Rooms were clean, comfortable with air con and fan included. Pool area and bar lovely. Staff were all friendly and very helpful. Buffet breakfast was excellent.",0
Stayed here with my husband on our honeymoon just had a standard room but it was clean and comfortable with a lovely pool view . Staff were extremely lovely couldnt do enough for you so friendly freefree breakfast and really nice pool/bar area . For what we paid well worth the money and more. Also bus 2min walk up the rd which takes you into mykonos main town plus other main attractions such as paradise beach . The beach and restaurants 3 min walk from the hotel were also awesome beach was very nice.,0
"We arrived at Mykonos port and George was there to pick us up, tried to make a friendly conversation however this man looked like he had enough and couldn't be bothered to speak to us or the other guests in the van, for the 4 days we stayed there he was the same so we thought he is obviously tired of this and they need a fresh energetic person very soon. Apart from that this hotel is marvelous, The receptionist could not do enough to make our stay comfortable, the breakfast staff were amazing and the cleaners were super efficient in every way, Faultless. The position of the hotel is the best that can be found. They also have a restaurant on the beach which we used however there are so many there that we decided to go to a different one every evening. Apart from the driver who is obviously tired of doing this everything else was 100%",0
The room was clean and new looking. The hotel had free van to and from the port. The breakfast was very good. Spent 5 nights there and i didnt want to leave. The hotel has a good restaurant on the beach that provides free loungers if u eat luch there. When my wife got a rash the hotel was very helpful and drove us to the hosiptal in their van. Getting a taxi is very difficult on the island.,0
"Amazing small, friendly and very clean hotel. Vicky on reception, Susannah at breakfast and Costa in the bar were all lovely and extremely helpful. Hotel is very well situated near to the beach and many great restaurants and the pool area is great with plenty of loungers and comfy sofas. Would highly recommend this hotel!",0
"We have just spent another fabulous week at the Argo. This was our third year staying at this Hotel and the welcome we received was lovely. Again nothing was to much trouble, thanks to Vicky for sorting our rooms out and Kosta and Susanna at the bar and at breakfast. This Hotel is a little gem and we're already planning our return!",0
"My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Greece. Mykonos was our first destination (so I'll explain how we got there, etc.) We came in from the US, so we flew Delta to Athens, collected our luggage, and rechecked our baggage on Agean Air for the flight to Mykonos. If I were to do this over, I would've flown into London and got a direct flight to Mykonos - live and learn! (The airport in Athens in surprisingly small for a major city, so I budgeted too long of a layover, thinking the transfer would take a couple of hours, rather than the 30 minutes it actually took).We arrived into Mykonos and George, the hotel driver, was waiting for us (transfer to/from hotel is included). The trip to the hotel was about 20 minutes, and traffic was not bad (end of June, so not at the height of season yet).The front desk ladies are both very friendly and welcoming, as are all of the staff. This is my first star - the staff is excellent and goes above and beyond to help. They are genuinely happy to see you, and remember details, like how you take your coffee :)The rooms are exceptionally clean. No carpet anywhere, all tile, so squeaky clean. The bed was a bit firm, but comfortable. My one and only complaint was the lack of storage in the room and bathroom. Other than that, it was very comfortable.There is soap and a shampoo dispenser in the shower, but I colour my hair, so I am particular about using my own products. There is no lotion, conditioner, etc. There is wifi all over the property and we had no problems connecting.The pool is very nice- here's my second star. It's also very clean, and refreshing - the sun is hot, so it was nice to have a cool pool to dip in to. There are loungers in the sun and shade - something for everyone. Also, the pictures that are online are very accurate, this is not a hotel that shines up their profile, what you see is what you get!My third star goes to the breakfast, which is vast and also tasty. There was a good selection of English breakfast things (no beans, though!), as well as Greek food. We ate a bit of both and you could fill up easily if you aren't careful (or, if it is your goal!) The forth star goes to location. The hotel is just a tiny walk up the hill from the public bus, which goes into Mykonos Town every 1/2 hour (at :10 and :40) for 1,80 Euros each way. It is about a 20 minute ride and very convenient. Alternately, you can take a taxi into town for about 10 Euros. The beach is not even a 5 minute walk down the hill, where the hotel's restaurant is located. The food is the best we had in Mykonos, very fresh, and a good variety. We ate here a few times. If you book in to the restaurant, you will have an umbrella and lounger on the beach, complimentary. The beach is pretty nice (water is great!), but crowded with loungers and people. If you want a quiet beach, you must rent a car/scooter/4 wheeler to get to a secluded spot. Also, there is a little shop directly across the road from the hotel that sells snacks, wine, sun cream, etc. It couldn't be more convenient!Of course we met the owner while we were here and he was a lovely guy. His father started the hotel and restaurant, and now he runs the place. He took the time to get to know us. I'm sure he's busier than a one armed paper hanger, but he took the time EVERY time he saw us to stop and say hello, how are things, I mean, who has time to do this with every guest? That guy, that's who. (Fifth star!) Which is why, we will be back. Our visit was just 3 days to the island, so of course, we have a reason to go back-there's so much more to see, and we'll definitely be staying here again!   Room Tip: We had a room on the top floor overlooking the pool. It had a small balcony. Perfect room. See more room tips",1
"Some hotels are spectacular because of their location or the number of stars they have on some rating list somewhere, or because some celeb goes there, but Argo is spectacular because of its wonderful people, its owner and staff, and the way they make you feel so at home. Yes, the rooms are great, spotlessly clean, have quiet effective air conditioning and large comfortable beds. The breakfast is varied and caters for all tastes, and the pool and bar areas are very relaxing, but back to those wonderful people… Everyone from Thanasis the owner, to Vicky and Popi on reception, George the driver, Costas at the bar, the breakfast staff and cleaners, are the most warm, friendly, helpful people who will do anything to help you out no matter what your need, and that is something very special.You may have guessed we are regular visitors to the Argo, which is true, having stayed there 7 times now. But holidays in Mykonos are all about relaxation and enjoyment, and with all the stress taken away from you by the crew at the helm of the Argo, that is exactly what you get. Recommended? It’s a must!!!Oh, and ps. Check out its sister restaurant Avli Tou Thodori, for the same experience in a culinary sort of way… its AMAZING!!!",1
"Loved every minute of staying at this hotel. Didn't want to leave. The staff are so helpful and friendly that you feel like you are part of their family. The pool is lovely. The rooms are great. The breakfasts are great, and the food at the restaurant is so good!!!! Argo, we will be back. Xx",1
"The location is really convenient just yards away from a public bus stop, beach and restaurants just round the corner. The room is spacious and clean, good selection at breakfast. I am most impressed with their service! Without even have to ask, they have offered to pick my ferry ticket up the next day (during the process of check in) and as promised, Poppi delivered my ticket by hand to my room the very next day. All the staffs at the hotel are tentative not intimidating. I feel safe as a solo female traveller.",0
"When we arrived to the New Port after a long, windy speed shuttle, we were greeted by a free shuttle transport from the port to the hotel. When we arrived to the hotel, we were greeted with smiles and led to our very spacious room that looked over the hotel pool and the Platys Gialos beach. We then received complementary drinks to welcome us before we walked to the beach (maybe 100m to the water) were the Argo Hotel has a restaurant that they give discounts to for people staying at the hotel. This restaurant also has sun beds and chairs that are free if you eat at the restaurant. Once back at the hotel, our room was great with a small balcony, both a fan and room AC, and a great amount of space with a king bed and two couches. The breakfast included is amazing and had a wide variety of great Greek breakfast foods. The pool is wonderful and has many chairs with options for shade or sunshine. When we were leaving, the hotel shuttled us to the port again (after buying and picking up our ferry tickets) and help us to the right location to wait for the ferry. I highly recommend and suggest this hotel! It's amazing location, staff, breakfast, rooms, and helpful transfers are great!",1
"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! The location was great. It was a 10 minute bus ride to Mykonos town and the bus stop was right outside the door, Also it is right by a great beach full of restaurants and bars and deck chairsThe rooms them selves are simple but perfect. They weren't overly big but just right for us. Breakfast was fine but nothing special. Wifi was good. Pool area was really nice.The best thing about the Argo is the service. They really go above and beyond. Poppy and Vicky are fantastic and the free transfers were a great bonus. I would definitely stay here again!",1
"We have stayed here for about 10 nights in September for the past two years. Everything excellent from breakfast to lunch and dinner at Avli on the beach. The room has always been great. Special thanks to Vicki and George when my husband damaged his leg last year, and the help they gave us. Looking forward to returning this September.",0
"This hotel is above excellent and proves to go above and beyond to cater to hotel guests. First, they offer free transport to and from airports and ports. This is an easy money saver. Then, after checking in -- they provide beach towels and bring welcome drinks (mint lemonade) to your room. We even had a window from our shower so we could see outside.The staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. The pool is very nice and the hotel is a short walk to the beach as well as the busstop which can take you to Mykonos town. Then the hotel is also connected to one of the best restaurants on the beach where you automatically get 10% off. The beaches are organized so you can grab a lounger and umbrella early in the day -- they don't charge you so long as you buy a few drinks -- which on this beach, you'll need it. The breakfast buffet is excellent -- everything from eggs, bacon, wine leaves, donuts, fruit, yogurt, espresso machine ... you name it!My only recommendations for guests who stay here are: bring your own conditioner and lotion & if you are sensitive to light you should bring an eye mask. There is also a mini market across the street if you forget anything.   Room Tip: quiet hotel, central location, friendly staff See more room tips",1
"Great location only steps from Platis Gilalis beach, very friendly staff and fantastic decor.swimming pool and every room has a patio.room well furnished and breakfast included in price of room as well as free shuttle from airport.",1
"Two friends and myself stayed at Argo Hotel and had a fabulous experience. For the price we paid, it could not have been better. The staff was extremely kind and helpful, especially Poppy, who helped us with whatever we needed and gave us great recommendations. The rooms are nice and clean. The restaurant connected to the hotel is WONDERFUL and not expensive. We ate there more meals than not, not to mention they have great lounge chairs on the beach. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. If you're looking for a very chic and luxurious hotel, this isn't your first pick but it is a greatly, small and cozy hotel   Room Tip: Rooms farthest away from lobby have very weak wifi! The family room is definitely the way to go for... See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for a night on our way back home via Mykonos and would definitely recommend. Super-friendly staff who genuinely go the extra mile to make your stay special. They have a pick up service when you arrive on Mykonos and will also deliver you to the airport when you leave.Delicious breakfast is included, great wifi, lovely pool, super restaurant and very comfortable rooms.Loved it!",0
"Attentive, friendly staff welcome you with drinks on arrival to this peaceful, modern, simple but stylish hotel. As a family of 4 we were well looked after, just a few minutes from the ""organized"" beach (loungers, restaurants etc). Their restaurant is also very good, offering a fruit platter after eating - yum. Would very much recommend, thank you all :)",0
"We found this hotel by chance 4/5 years ago and have been going back at least twice a year ever since, and as seasoned travellers, this is as a high a compliment as we can give.All the staff are brilliant and will do anything they can to help, even regulars like us are welcomed with open arms even though we know the set up in the resort down to a tee.The long serving staff namely George, Vicky and Costas will really look after you from start to finish and the new staff, Popi and Suzanna are very welcome additions to the team. I have reviewed this sister restaurant down the road a number of times and need to add nothing to my previous reviews. It is just one of my favourite restaurants in the world when you consider, the view, the service and the food as an overall dining experience.Yes, Mykonos prices have gone up in the last year or so due to the austerity measures, but will this put me off going again ? No way, but with everyone only having a certain amount of disposable income, I might just have to go for one less night next time around, unless my wife pulls rank on me of course !!I have no doubt that you will enjoy this place if you decide to go here.",0
"A great hotel that prides itself on friendly and professional staff. Rooms are spacious and very clean and mostly overlook the beautiful pool and breakfast area. Beach towels were provided and came in handy as we toured the island on a scooter. An added bonus was the hotels own restaurant located on Platis Gialos Beach (10% off for guests) that was top class with fantastic service. Although I must admit I was not a fan of the beach area that was dominated by umbrellas and sun beds that each of the restaurants 'own' but if you are into that type of beach scene then this will suit you. On the plus side the hotels pool was magnificent and very refreshing after touring the island. Best of all was the amazing breakfast (included in the tariff) that we were expecting to be basic but were very wrong, fantastic food served up again with brilliant service. We spent 4 nights at Argo and I would thoroughly recommend the hotel for couples or families. If you like friendly service and a great location only 12 minutes to Mykonos Old Town by public bus or your own quad or scooter, then you cannot go wrong with Argo.   Room Tip: All rooms are double glazed so don't worry about noise of the pool or road - you cant hear a thi... See more room tips",0
"We loved Argo Hotel!!! They arranged free rides to and from the port/airport. The staff were delightful and so helpful. The free breakfast had a ton of variety and it was delicious! Location was amazing to Platis Gialos (2 minute walk) and the bus stop (less than a minute walk). We loved hanging out in the sun beds on the beach while eating/drinking at the hotel's restaurant, Avli Tou Thodori. Room was spotless and we absolutely loved our balcony!! We were so sad to leave! We'll be back!!",0
"Our second stop on our Greece vacation was a few days in Mykonos. We opted to stay near Platys Galdios, which is a beach location outside of the old town center. This was perfect for us as we enjoyed the beach during the day and took the bus into town at night. The bus stop is just outside the door of the hotel, and the ride to town takes about15-20 minutes (I imagine in the summer the ride could take longer due to traffic). The bus was crowded so plan accordingly. But back to the hotel. Rooms are not overly spacious but very clean and comfortable (though I do wish they would provide a top sheet and not just the heavy duvet). Staff was very accommodating and the breakfast buffet by the pool area was a great start to the day. And be sure to visit the related restaurant (Avli Tou Thodori) on the water (only a 5 minute walk) as it was excellent. We returned twice for dinner and once for lunch. This hotel offers exceptional value for the price, especially after visiting Santorini!",0
"Found a little Gem on the Greek Island of Mykonos (Argo) Hotel, Staff were so friendly, Rooms Were more then ample lovely balcony,with Sea viewsThe Hotel was In a great location four minutes walk to beach and Restaurants,Steve Murray   Room Tip: Not needed they are all lovely, But our room no was 106 See more room tips",0
This was a stand out hotel on our recent 4 island trip.The staff were so helpful but also seemed genuinely friendly & always had time for a chat.The restaurant that is part of this hotel 2 min walk away was also great.,0
"We came to Mykonos last year in August and loved it, great beaches, excellent food, and the ability to take trips by ferry to other islands; it really was a great fun vacation. I came this year for my friend’s birthday who also fell in love with the island, for those who prefer a more sedate holiday it is probably best to book either May or September as June, July and August are extremely busy (the island is in full party swing)I found the hotel Argo after eating at the Alvi restaurant last year which I must say is the best food in Mykonos, and what makes it a cut above the rest is it's consistency, always cooked to perfection. After eating their a few times the owner showed me the Argo hotel which is located behind the restaurant, I was impressed with the rooms and the facilities that were available so I booked for this year and arrived on the 8th May 2016.I had booked to stay their for 15 days but in my speed to book the room I made a little error and booked a hotel with the same name but on a different island (could only be me) called Naxos which was 1hour 20 minutes away, a must to see. On arrival at Mykonos airport the owner of the Argo in Mykonos (Thanasis) was kind enough to lay on his driver to take us from the airport to the ferry port (the driver gave us a warm and friendly welcome to the island), unfortunately on arrival at the airport I was told that there was a strike and that no ferries would be disembarking until the 10th May. Thanasis came to the rescue and saved the day by having a room at his hotel for the first 2 days he then had his driver take us to the ferry port to travel on to the Argo Hotel in Naxos, we stayed there for 5 days then returned to Mykonos for the second week, where we had friends flying in to join us which was wonderful. My room was on the first floor and over looked the pool with a partial sea view; it had a huge balcony with 2 modern rocking chairs and a table. The housekeeper ensures the room was immaculate on a daily basis, the room also has air conditioning and a ceiling fan, free Wi-Fi, free tea and coffee facilities, and a fridge stocked with drinks and snacks, and for those who like to keep up to date with the news, a flat screen TV which showed the World News and English films in the evenings. The bathroom is fitted with a rainforest shower and a hairdryer for those that need one (I did many years ago).Check-in was fast and easy. Poppy the receptionist is one of the best I have met and I have trave",0
"I have been to many hotels in sunny places, but this unobtrusive hotel almost at the end of the road from Mykonos Town to Platys Gialos is one of the very best. Besides the high standard of cleanliness (the staff seem to clean every surface, every day) and the amazing variety of delicious breakfast goodies (catering for both British and continental tastes) and the proximity to the beach (from your room to the sand in about four minutes) the finest asset this hotel has is its staff, especially Poppi and Vicki, the delightful receptionists, who deal with every enquiry with both warmth and professionalism, and who treat guests as friends. George the bus driver is efficient and helpful, the lady who looks after the breakfast buffet (whose name we did not catch) keeps the food flowing and is always smiling and ready to chat. The chef deserves praise for the many delicious Greek breakfast items she produces. The rooms are laid out on four levels : some face the jacuzzi and sun beds, those on the terrace above that face the breakfast bar and the pool, and the two rows above that look over the rooftops to the sea : our room was on the top floor, which gave us a sea view and a view of hills both close by and on the horizon. The room decor was cool, the balcony sunny in the morning and sandy in the afternoon. Free wi-fi is also provided, and access to a computer in the hotel lobby.  Some facts which the hotel does not put in its website - beach/pool towels are available without charge or deposit from reception, and there are tea/coffee making facilities in each room. The Argo is close by the bus stop, and the service gets you into Mykonos town in about fifteen minutes, for one euro eighty. Just down the road to the beach and you are at the pier, from which water taxis and excursion boats leave - and you are also at the Avli restaurant, owned by the hotel, which allows you a ten-percent discount on meals (and in our case, each time we sided there, a free dessert).  I can fully understand why the Argo receives such high approval ratings - I would certainly recommend a stay there and would love to return there myself!   Room Tip: Top floor rooms have good sea views. See more room tips",2
"Cannot say how much we enjoyed our stay in this fantastic hotel. All the staff, from the moment George picked us up from the airport, to unfortunately taking us back, were so helpful and friendly. They could not do enough for us. The room and bed were so comfortable with clean towels every day. Tea and coffee in the room as well. The breakfast was so substantial that lunch was often not needed. Such a choice. Thannasis, the owner of the hotel also owns the restaurant which serves gorgeous food and is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, overlooking the sea.Thank you to all the staff, especially Vicky, for caring for us so well while we were with you. We couldn't have been better looked after. Would recommend this hotel to everyone, just like home from home. Many thanks to Thannasis for the lovely warming drink he bought me every night! DON'T CHANGE A THING. It is perfect.",1
"Agree with all the lovely comments about this Hotel..great location. spotlessly clean, very friendly and helpful staff..especially Poppi who was lovely..appreciated the tea & coffee facilities in the room as well, comfy beds..lovely varied breakfasts, we have just spent 10days there.and will be returning in Sept.",1
"My wife and I have a philosophy that as there are so many places in this world to visit why return to somewhere no matter how good a time you have had. This year we broke the rules and returned to The Argo. It was as BRILLIANT as ever and we were not disappointed. This review does not dwell on the specifics of the hotel e.g. room, cleanliness,facilities as these are covered in detail in many of the excellent reviews. This hotel is just a magnificent home from home where nothing is too much trouble. The staff without exception are so friendly and there one aim is to ensure that your stay is memorable. Thank you to Thannasis, Vicky, Poppi, George, Susannah, Irene, Costas and the rest for making our holiday special.",0
"First time in Mykonos and the Argo Hotel. What a wonderful little hotel, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The breakfasts were delicious with choice and also the option of freshly cooked omelettes etc. Delicious. Rooms spotless.The hotel also has a restaurant at the beach which is highly recommended, great food, great value and fantastic staff",1
This hotel is outstanding along with its restaurant Avli . The staff offer service to that of a five star hotel. Each room has adequate facilities and are spotlessly clean.I could not find fault and cannot wait to return.,0
"Great location. Excellent breakfasts. Some of the friendliest staff I have met in hotels, couldn't do enough for you. Well maintained property with a great swimming pool which was a little cold but it was early May!!",0
"We stayed here on a short stop in Mykonos in May. Although the weather want great, our stay was made especially great because of the lovely staff at hotel Argo. They helped us coordinate a ferry when most of the boats were cancelled in a strike, and always had great recommendations on where to go/what to do in Mykonos. Plus, the free breakfast was excellent and had a wide variety of foods including pastries, cereals, hot eggs/meats, and others. Plus it's a very short walk to one of the nicest beaches on the island. Would definitely recommend it!",0
"Our stay at the Argo Hotel was amazing. The location was perfect for what we wanted. Taxi rides into town were only 10 euros, or you can take the bus for only 1.80 euros. We received first class service from the staff, which included transfers to and from the port. The breakfast that they provide was probably the best that I've ever had at a hotel. Would definitely stay here again!",0
"In my experience, Greeks are very friendly and this was reinforced by the staff at Argo. Always personable and helpful, they went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. Rooms were somewhat small but comfortable. The pool area was lovely. Breakfast offered a wide variety of hot and cold foods, all very good. The owners have a nearby restaurant on the beach where guests are offered a discount. We had rented a car so I also appreciated the free parking lot. The photo is the sunrise view from our balcony. You won't regret choosing this affordable alternative to pricey hotels.",0
"This isn't the fanciest hotel on Mykonos, but it's one of the best. The village of Platis Gialos is a good place to base yourself on the island, as it's a relaxing, well-located seaside town with enough acitivities and infrastructure (particularly good restaurants) to keep you entertained. While the Argo doesn't have an ocean view (it's two minutes walk to the beach, and you can usually use the beach loungers of their sister restaurant directly on the beach), it makes up for it with great hospitality, a terrific hot and cold breakfast buffet, a nice pool area and very comfortable rooms. And the prices (at least in early May) were quite affordable. I stay in dozens of hotels each year, and very few are as satisfying as the Argo. Their 5-star rating on TripAdvisor is completely deserved.BTW, the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the airport and ferry and it's less than 2 Euro (and 10 minutes) for the bus into Mykonos town. The hotel can also help you arrange an ATV bike (seats two persons and has four wheels) for less than 30 euros for 24 hours. The ATV canl get you to all the beaches and sites on the island. It makes for a fun 1 day excursion if you're brave enough to ride (pretty easy, actually).",0
"Visited Argo hotel on the 30th April'16.Had a wonderful experience. Great people.Also it was an Easter weekend in Greece so enjoyed a lot.Argo also own the Avli restaurant maybe it is #1 in Mykonos. This is just 2 mins away from the Hotel and to add it has awesome food and desserts were simply the best.The breakfast in Argo was awesome and the rooms and washrooms were clean and well maintained.Will highly recommend Argo for stay and food.Thanks Argo team,Ankur and Supriya",0
"This is a fantastic hotel in a great location in Mykonos. I stayed here with 2 other friends and we were treated exceptionally well by all the staff. We were welcomed with open arms and our room was excellent. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - thanks to the receptionists, night porter, cleaners, maintenance men and in particular the lovely breakfast lady who always welcomed us to breakfast with a smile!   Room Tip: Family rooms are excellent See more room tips",2
"The Argo is a lovely hotel situated a short walk from the beach. Our room had a sea view, huge bed, fridge for cold drinks and great shower. The staff are amazing and breakfast plentiful. You'll always be served with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. Highly recommended.",1
"Had a great week here in May 2016, the room was spacious for three people and all amenities were as stated. The hotel staff were also really friendly and helpful, and the cleaning staff did a really thorough job every day. The hotel is well located to Mykonos town (5 mins in a taxi) and a number of good beaches.",1
"Its a beautiful hotel nestled in the calm and peacful area of mykonos , steps away from the sea shore. Its clean , tidy and affiliated with modern fittings and furnitures. We were there last year in 2015 and the room we got had great view of the beach. Apart from a great pool side with music and dining area their staff is really welcoming and of great help. I would like to thanks VICKY, GEORGE and rest of the staff for making our stay best is all respect. We will definately visit again.",2
This hotel is great! the pictures are an accurate representation of the hotel. Breakfast is served by the pool with a variety of Greek breakfast food. The staff are very friendly without being artificial. It is in great walking proximity to the beach Platis Gialos and for access to Mykonos centre by local coach/bus. I would definitely recommend it for a family stay.,3
"We stayed here in June 2015 - it was perfect. The room was lovely, the staff were super helpful. The breakfast was really nice aswell. The pool wasn't ever really busy and was a welcome change to the beach. The beach was only a 5-10mins walk away - that too was perfect! The bus to Mykonos town stopped right outside the hotel and only took about 15mins. All in all the perfect stay and we will definitely stay here again!",2
"The Argo is in an ideal Location, just a 10 min drive from the Airport, and only 4 kilometers from Mykonos Town. There is a free pick up service from the Airport if requested, however we made our own way there as we'd hired a car. The hotel has its own car park that has a security pass entrance/exit system. The hotel has a breakfast area that is right beside the pool, it offers an wide variety of options both sweet and savoury. As well as an outdoor pool there is also a hot tub and numerous loungers available.The rooms are very clean, light and airy, ours had a balcony overlooking the pool and the sea.The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Vicky the receptionist. The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the beach ,which is fully organised....nearby you will find numerous bars and restaurants including an excellent one belonging to the Argo (residents of the Argo get a 10% discount) The bus stop to go into Mykonos town is just at the end of the Hotels car park and costs 1.8 Euro each way...tickets can be bought from the little shop right opposite the Argo. Although i'm not sure if wifi is available in the rooms there are laptops with free wifi access available in the reception area.All in all a right gem.   Room Tip: I think the rooms by and above the pool area offer nicer views rather than those down by the hot tub... See more room tips",2
"We stayed at Hotel Argo based on the great reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We loved every minute of it. The hotel is small and always felt so peaceful and relaxing! There was always room to sit by the pool - never any need to rush down and reserve one (big pet hate of mine) The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect! Its a two minute walk to a lovely beach, with restaurants lined along the back. The bus stop is also right outside the hotel and is the first or last stop for the route into Mykonos town, meaning you would always get a seat - trust me the bus does fill up very quickly along the route into town. There is also a little convenient store right across the road from the hotel. I had heard about the pick up service they provide from the airport so got in touch with the hotel to enquire. They got straight back to me asking for the flight information and booked in the complimentary pick up. The breakfast was great, so much variety every single day! You can order lunch at the pool bar, very speedy service, they phone through to the hotels restaurant (voted best on the whole island ) to deliver the food. We took advantage of this most lunch times!",3
"My husband and I stayed at Argo for 4 nights after coming from a week stay in Santorini. The hotel van (free shuttle) was waiting for us at the port when we arrived which was outstanding. Our room was nicely updated and modern with a nicely remodeled bathroom as well. Air conditioning worked great. The complimentary breakfast every morning was really good! There is a small grocery store directly across the street which was very handy. Room had small balcony with view of the pool. The pool was pretty with nice loungers and a pool bar. . If you are wanting a beach/water view then this isn't the place for you. It is only about a block down the street to get to the beach. The hotel also owns a restaurant on the beach which has very good food and you do get a discount if you stay at Argo hotel. You can also use the restaurant's beach loungers and umbrellas at no charge if you order lunch and drinks during the day which we did all but our last day. My favorite drink was called ""The Recommended"" and I really recommend it!!! :) The service on the beach for drinks was not good at all and they needed more waiters. We used the beach loungers 2 days and then the 3rd day after waiting for 45 minutes for a waiter to come take our order we left. They could have made twice as much money from us just on drinks had they wanted to. When I am on a vacation like this I like great service. Our last day at the beach we walked down the beach and got beach loungers in the morning at Mykonos Palace Hotel and even though we paid for the front row loungers by the water it was well worth it!! They had a lot nicer loungers, more space and the waiters came around quickly with drinks all day long and the staff was very friendly. It was also well organized, we just sat down where we wanted and then they come around later and collect the money. . We met a nice couple from England who sat next to all day and who were staying at Mykonos Palace. I would also recommend the Notos restaurant (on the beach) at the Mykonos Palace Hotel. It is gorgeous & romantic at night!! The Argo Hotel was a great value but if you can afford it, you might want to look at the Mykonos Palace due to the proximity to the beach and the great beach service. We took a water taxi to Super paradise beach and I would not recommend it. There is nothing there except for one bar/restaurant (Jackie O's). Since we didn't want to stay there and didn't want to pay for the more expensive loungers since we weren't staying, we had to waste another hour or so sitting in the beach waiting for the water taxi to come back. Platys Gialos beach ( Where Argo Hotel & Mykonos Palace is at) is definitely nicer and has soft sand. One night we took a short bus ride (bus stop is not even a block away) to Mykonos Town to see the windmills and Little Venice. We enjoyed it and there is a ton of shopping and restaurants there. Our trip to Greece was amazing and we had a great time!!!",2
"Great location and hotel. Nice and quiet, pool area very nice and plenty of beds. Breakfast had plenty of choice and served in a lovely setting next to the pool. Staff very helpful and welcoming, we will be staying here again!",0
I spend 4 days with my cousin in that quite hotel. It is not far from the beach an from the bus. Easy to go to Mykonos (20minutes).People where really nice and the place was quite. The room and bathroom was clean.The breakfast is good with some choice.You will enjoy,1
"What a fabulous Hotel. I stayed here for 4 nights in September of this year before moving to a villa for a further 7 nights for my wedding. We turned up (all 17 of us - family) and the hotel staff couldn't do enough for us. They were so helpful when i was asking 101 questions regarding getting around the island and booking restaurants for dinner. The location is superb, even closer to the beach than i imagined. The bus stop is just outside and only a 10 min ride into town. The Hotels restaurant (Avli restaurant) is amazing too - we ate here twice in the 4 nights. The rooms are clean and have everything you need. We couldn't have asked for more. I was so nervous turning up - all the pressure was on me (as the bride) as i had booked the accommodation for everyone but they absoutley loved it, so much that my mother in law and father in law have booked to go back next May already. And are staying at Argo again.George took us anywhere we wanted to go - he was amazing. He even transported us when we were staying at the villa. Trying to move 17 people is hard work and he made this so easy for us. Thanks George :)The guy behind the bar (forgotten his name) would go and buy cider for us and anything else we wanted, and make any cocktail we requested. A superb service. I don't write reviews - but i had to for this hotel. If you go to Mykonos stay here. You wont be disappointed. Thank you to everyone for your excellent service, we really felt like you went above and beyond. We will come back and visit for sure. Love Gemma and Dan (the new Mr & Mrs Orme) x",4
"Great family run hotel in a perfect location in Platis Giaolos. The hotel has a transfer service from the airport and from the first meeting with George you feel at home and welcomed into the family. The hotel is in a super position just a short walk from the beach , all the staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was clen well furnished and comfortable with a good bathroom. The balcony gave a good view over the bay. The hotel swimming pool was excellent warm water with a pool bar with Costas providing great service. overall a great holida we shall return next year !",1
"We loved staying here! The staff is so attentive and so kind. They helped us organize everything from dinner reservations to transportation to the airport. The rooms are large, clean and well organized. Location of hotel is very ideal, it is steps to the beach, steps to the bus stops that takes you in to Mykonos town, as well as the RTV rentals.",0
"We stayed at the Argo Hotel for 3 nights/4 days during a whirlwind Tukrey and Greece trip so that we could get some beach time. The rest of our trip was a lot of moving and sightseeing and walking so Mykonos was all about relaxing and that's exactly what this hotel allowed us to do. I booked while still home in Canada and got a very polite and helpful email confirming my reservation and airport pickup right away. We were greeted at the airport and taken to the hotel at about 10am where we were told that our room is ready and breakfast was still going on so we are welcome to help ourselves! The breakfasts here were to die for (especially after coming from Turkey where they don't do much) and I love that they played music out by the pool while we ate.The room was spotless. We had a view overlooking the pool and could see the ocean. The hotel has also thought of everything and the slippers we SO nice (this way we also didn't get sand all over our room from the beach).The hotel is just a 2 minute walk down to the beach where we spent most of our time, and 30 seconds away from the public bus stop that we took into Mykonos town. We loved staying on this part of the island!We also ate at the Avli restaurant one evening (and got 10% off because we told them where we were staying when we made the reservation) and I regret not eating there a second time instead of trying somewhere else. The food was amazing. We even got complimentary dessert which was SO GOOD! After checking out we still had a full day... the hotel was kind enough to store our luggage and let us use their beach towels all day. Before grabbing our shuttle back to the airport we showered and changed down by the pool. Like I said, they have everything!Everything felt like we were staying in a $500/night resort without having the guilt or ""snobbishness"" of an expensive place. If I can justify a European beach vacation I will definitely be back but for much longer! Thank you to everyone for your excellent service, we really felt like you went above and beyond.",3
"A very nice hotel with helpful staff, a great breakfast and free port/airport transfers, however we like quiet resorts and Platis Gialos is very busy with wall-to-wall sunbeds on the beach and it feels quite claustrophobic. This wasn't the hotel's fault, but we were very glad we had made the effort to explore Naxos and Antiparos rather than spending our entire holiday on Mykonos as it's very crowded in August. Argo Hotel was perfect for the last night of our holiday though.The family room we booked wasn't huge but it very clean and it opened straight onto the pool area which was a bonus. Like everywhere in Mykonos in August, it was extremely expensive though.",1
"Enjoyed a return visit to the Argo hotel (after a year) and found it to be as comfortable and welcoming as it was in 2014. The staff were helpful and efficient as can be (including collecting me from Mykonos airport), the room was large, comfortable with a lovely view from a roomy balcony, nice bathroom with an efficient shower, wifi that worked in the room, and new kettle for coffee and tea. The free breakfast was as varied and fresh as last year (with a better coffee machine), the pool and its surrounds were lovely and peaceful, and the management was tip-top. With 10% off at the best hotel in the resort (Avli tou Thodori), a location just a two minute walk to the beach, and the welcoming - almost family-like atmosphere - I would recommend this hotel to everyone who was looking for a peaceful and comfortable vacation on Mykonos. Many thanks to the whole team at the Argo.",0
"Great Service from one of the best staffs you will encounter, Great location within a couple of blocks walking distance of sought after restaurants and the best beach, clean spacious rooms, lovely bar/pool area, breakfast a cut above including pasteries, fruit, eggs, toast, salads, tomatoes, pizza, cheeses and sausage. Directly accross the street is a small convenience store where you can purchase bus tickets to attractions and within a few additonal steps to the bus stop. Our party of four loved this place. It is relatively small much to the joy of most and if the age groups are not in sync then one can walk to dining/entertainment elsewhere. The wifi seemed to be better around the pool.",1
Do yourself a favor and experience the wonderful hospitality and superb location once in your life time. This place is really like staying with friends because the staff are so kind. No surprising most guests were returning again and again.  Room Tip: Sit back and enjoy the welcome drinks See more room tips,1
"Thank you to ALL the staff at The Argo. Your friendly welcome, attentive service, tourist information & facilities were all wonderful & made our stay relaxed. Great position to for beach, bus & restaurants.",0
"We had a fabulous stay at the Argo Hotel, it's a calmness in a busy resort. The staff are excellent and extremely friendly, the rooms are lovely, clean and airy.Breakfast by the pool is very easy and the reception staff very helpful. Really enjoyed this stay",0
"I can only add my comments to the string of compliments this gem of a hotel has already received....from George's help with directions when we arrived at the airport (he was there to do the free shuttle service) to Vicky's warm welcome on arrival and her continued help, advice and lovely smile all through our holiday plus all the other staff especially those preparing the wonderful breakfast buffet every morning...yum!. Agree with the 'boutique' feel of the hotel with modern, light finish to our room...fab view from ours , overlooking the pool and bay beyond. Location was gr8, being within a few minutes walk of the main beach and choice of restaurants that were behind it. The beach was lovely but too 'developed' for us as too many sunbeds/umbrellas for us but soon found another a short walk away. The associate restaurant was excellent as was the 10% discount given to visitors to the Argo!....would recommend the Argo and it's wonderful staff without hesitation, so thank you for making this a super holiday.   Room Tip: Go for top floor for pool and bay views(ours was 104) See more room tips",0
"My girlfriend and I are just about to leave from this amazing place... I would say that this is our paradise! Staff is very friendly and helped us a lot during our first days to rent a motorbike and stuff...There is also a swimming pool as you can see in the picture and a jacuzzi hot tub going down the stairs! Laptops and printers are available just in case you need to print off your flight tickets.The hotel is not far from Paradise Beach in fact you can reach it on foot, going up and down the hill.Trust me and other people, this is the best solution for your stay in Mykonos!",1
"This was our 2nd visit to the Argo in 3 years and we were not disappointed to return. Hotel was immaculate just like the first time and still serves the best breakfast in Greece. The 2 meals we had at Alvi (their sister restaurant) were again excellent. The service is fantastic, as well as picking us up at the airport and dropping us off at the port, George picked up our ferry tickets for us during our stay so we didn't need to queue up ourselves. We were there 4 nights the 2nd week in September, we spent 2 nights in Platys Gialos itself and another 2 in Mykonos town which is so easy to reach (10 min on the buses that leave every 30 min and run every hour through the night). Mykonos was starting to get quieter and the difference between our first night (which was the 1st Saturday in September) and our last was actually significant. If you want it busy then go 1 week earlier. If you are thinking of staying in Mykonos town then I actually would say Platys Gialos is better. We have stayed in both in the past and Platys Gialos is so convenient for the town in the evening but much better located for the day time. We would of course then strongly recommend the Argo, one of our favourite all round hotels anywhere in the world, we will definitely be back.   Room Tip: All rooms face the same way so all are good See more room tips",2
"Everything about Argo is 1st rate. Simply put ARGO IS CHIC AND ELEGANT. what's more Argo offers incredible value for money. Wonderful staff pander to your every wish. a beautiful beach or great pool to lounge by. Big, clean, really comfortable bedrooms with lovely bathrooms. Their restaurant Avli is superb. What is their secret? Their magic? Their je ne sais pas? Go and see, The Entire Argo Team really appreciates you & it shows. THANK YOU THANK YOU.A 10 minute bus/car brings you into town.   Room Tip: book directly so they know your priorties See more room tips",0
"I have just come back from my 6th visit to the Argo Hotel in Mykonos and can say, without doubt, that the high standards I first found here are still very much alive and well.All of the staff are still lovely and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them, whatever advice or help you need.My youngest son and his girlfriend who are both in their 20's and were first time visitors with us were very, very impressed, which was really nice to hear from them on our return home.There is a little word of caution from me though. Whilst I was reserving my 7th visit in May next year, I discovered that the Argo is nearly full in a couple of weeks in June 2016 already, so the clear advice from this regular customer is........'book early for 2016'.I know I have. Enjoy !!   Room Tip: We prefer the top floor rooms. See more room tips",2
My husband and I chose Argo for our first time in Mykonos based on TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed! George picked us up from the airport even though we arrived incredibly early. The hotel staff invited us to have breakfast and store our luggage until our room became available. The property is lovely and the staff is so friendly and accommodating! The rooms are very nice and the beds are super comfortable. The breakfast is amazing and was the best we had at any of our hotels in Greece. The hotel is walking distance to the beach and a number of beachfront restaurants. The bus to take you the short trip into town stops right in front of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone considering a vacation in Mykonos!,0
"we were picked up from the airport and taken to the hotel, nice touch, we were 2 couples and staying 7 nights, amazing hotel, couldn't fault it at all. the staff very friendly and helpful. went out of their way to make you feel at home. rooms a good size, breakfast included, and an amazing range of home cooked food and different every day. very central, just a stroll down to the beach and all the restaurants are there. bus stop to the city of mkyonos, about 10-15mins, family rooms downstairs facing the pool which was is a good size. we were upstairs and it overlooked the pool and the beach   Room Tip: upstairs have balconies and overlook the pool and the water See more room tips",0
We are currently in Room 112 which is a very nice room. Breakfast by the pool is the best we have had in six weeks travelling in Europe! Cappuciono's are excellent. All staff have been most friendly and helpful. Bed very comfortable. Good hot shower and modern bathroom. Nice sized balcony with comfortable chairs. Shuttle service from ferry and to airport is a very nice touch - Geprge the driver was there when we arrived. The hotel staff even check you in online for your flight! And provide you with your boarding pass. Only two small negatives - neighbours across street had a small child who screamed loudly for long periods and the drinks by the pool are a little expensive for sample 9 euros for a basic gin and tonic mid-sized! Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again - a very well managed operation. Congrats to the owner and manager - you have a real gem here.,0
"We were met and whisked away from the airport by a very spritely George and dropped off within half an hour of arriving in Mykonos! Transfer was very painless. Our room, which overlooked the swimming pool, was very clean and comfortable. A great shower, powerful and hot! Not a lot of hanging/wardrobe space if you have lots of luggage.Tea and coffee making facilities were available. Along with a safe.Room cleaned every day and all linen, beds and towels, were changed every day.Staff were always on hand and ready to help.Wi-fi in the room was a bit slow, but in communal areas, ie pool and reception, much quicker.Hotel is in a perfect position for the beach and restaurants and easy for the local bus into town.Overall this was a great stay. Thank you all staff Argo",1
"It was our 2nd year in a row here with our 2 year old child. This time we brought our friends with their 2 kids with us too. We all had an amazing time.The staff (who were the same as the previous year - this speaks volumes), and the facilities are just perfect.Argo Hotel will always be special to us and we recommend it to all.thanks for having us again!",0
"It was our second time at this hotel and all I can say is that it's a good hotel but Platys Gialos is very very crowdy. There is no place to rest without sunbed at the beach and the sunbeds are very near between them. The hotel has a good breakfast and it is quite comfortable, basic accommodation but a little expensive for what you get.Near to the beach and to the buses to Mykonos. Free pick up from the airport, very nice staff, nice pool.",0
"This was our first time in Mykonos. This hotel is amazing. Very trendy and super clean.We were given a choice of rooms on arrival and decided to take the room at the annex up the side road. Our room was beautiful with a fantastic view from our terrace of the pool and the most amazing sunsets - truly magical.Breakfast was excellent with so many choices, scrambled and boiled eggs, sausages, tomatoes, various breads and pastries. The most amazing yoghurt and fruit.. the list is endless. Very fresh and the breakfast room was immaculate.Then to the staff.. well only one word really.. fantastic.,.Panos the owner is one of the nicest people we have met, very polite, always said good morning and came to have a chat and would answer any questions and give really helpful advice about the island.A big thank you to George and Mario for our lifts into town you are fab.Also to Costa who works in the hotel bar - thank you for keeping us supplied with G&T's and white wine and for your lovely company, a true gentleman.A huge thank you to Dimitri who works up at the annexe,, he excels in customer service and was a pleasure to meet, I wish I could have taken him home in my suitcase.This hotel is amazing, Panos and his staff are amazing,. please book you will not be dissapointedWe will be back next year I promise, thank you all for an amazing holiday.See you in 2017 xxxx   Room Tip: The annex rooms have the best views of the sunset.. amazing See more room tips",0
"Me and my friends have just returned from our 5 night stay at the Aeolos Hotel. Prior to arriving we read the reviews on Trip Advisor and from our stay, we can now see why this is the number 1 hotel in Mykonos Old Town. From the service, to the food, to the location, we all had a wonderful stay. One member of the party arrived earlier in Mykonos than the rest of us, and when we booked the hotel, they said one transfer, for us to be picked up at the airport was included, but as one of the girls arrived early, they said they would be happy to pick her up and pick the rest of us up later on in the day. Already, a great sign of service. Now all arrived, Panos, the owner of the hotel, gave a great detail of the local area and how to get around the island which was helpful. I then realised as soon as I got to my room, I stupidly left my phone on the plane! I spoke to Panos and his team at reception and they said the airport office is closed and will call again in the morning. The next morning, they called the airport and I got my phone back! George drove straight down to the airport, and I said I would be happy to travel down there with him, but they said do not worry. I was very impressed with the service and great to have my phone back. During our stay, we ate lunch at the pool. And the food was a good price, had a wide selection and was very tasty. We had many club sandwiches! Throughout our stay, Panos, Mario and George were always helpful and making sure we had everything we needed and having a good time. In the evenings we went out, and George and Mario would drive us down to the Old Town, which was greatly appreciated. We never asked them, but they were always ready to help.Regarding the hotel, the pool is very pretty and had lots of space to sunbathe round it. Had such a chilled vibe, which is a great contrast to the evenings, when you go out. Just what we wanted. The rooms were very clean and we had a great room overlooking the pool. From reading the reviews regarding location and the walk to the town and back, one review say its takes 35mins and that is not true at all (I would say about 20mins maximum). Yes walking up the steep hill is not great, but got easier each night and have to say is good exercise! It really isn’t that far and I guess it has to be done. We did it 4 out of 5 nights and it was fine. what is good is that when you get to the top, there is a convenience store and you can buy a big bottle of water for 1 euro! Yes people are mentioning you have to walk on the main road and there is no pavement, but I think that is just the island itself. It really wasn’t an issue. There are hotels in Mykonos town, but I definitely recommend this place.Me and the rest of the girls had a great time in Mykonos and loved the hotel. We want to thank Panos, Mario and George for making our trip to Mykonos even better than we expected!",3
"We had an amazing week under the care of Panos and his boys,George,Kristos & Mario from the moment we arrived until the time we left, the service we received was beyond all expectations.The hotel is a credit to Panos, beautifully decorated and modern. Nothing is to much trouble for them offering you lifts down into Mykinos and also picking you up from the airport.We really feel that we are your life long friends now and look forward to seeing you again. I would defiantly recommend this hotel. Thank you soooo much for making our holiday special, Jenny,Paul, Wendy and Spen,",2
"Words alone cannot describe the feelings this hotel gives you, only staying here gives you the memories that will stay forever.My husband, mum, dad and I stayed for a week and it definitely was not long enough, Panos, George, Kostas and Marios are perfect gentleman, the rest of the staff are wonderful too.Nothing was ever any trouble for any of them. We were given all the information needed to have the perfect week.We were driven into town whenever we wanted to go.We enjoyed fun filled days with them, laughter and many fabulous cocktails. Panos makes the best Cosmopolitan, (sorry Kostas)We were very sad to leave.Panos you have a beautiful hotel and perfect staff.Thank you for your generous hospitality.Wendy, Spence, Jenny and Paul. Xx",3
"We have just arrived back from Mykonos, and we have had a fantastic stay at Aeolos. The entire team were friendly and warm from start to finish. Nothing was to much trouble. We were offered lifts were needed and they were genuinely concerned that we was ok at all times. The pool is a great size , the hotel makes you feel like you are exactly in the heart of Greece with its design, the bar stayed open till late 2am (but not a loud bar), and the location was great . 10 minutes walk into the main strip. I would defiantly recommend this hotel. Thank you much for making our trip so special Natalie Glynne and the crew :)   Room Tip: I would suggest any room higher up would be less noisy, but there really wasn't any concern for...

I don't normally write reviews but Panos and his team deserve the praise. The service delivered here goes above and beyond. The hotel is also immaculate.We stayed with our 1 year old baby and they were extremely accommodating.Thank you for taking such good care of us,0
After losing our booking at our original hotel (due to lowcostholidays) we got directed to Aelos and Panos and his team. They found somewhere for us to stay for a night and then were able to accommodate us for 3 nights despite it being high season; they did us a massive favour juggling things around. The hotel is awesome and the staff are the best I have ever experienced! Panos is so welcoming and his team are always on hand to help out no matter what. Thank you so much to everyone at the hotel; you made our trip to Greece unforgettable and we shall definitely be back :),1
"I came to visit Mykonos with my mother after having holidayed in Santorini for the past three years and wanted a change. Mykonos did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived at the airport, George was waiting there to pick us up and take us back to the hotel despite us landing 2 hours later than expected. He was extremely friendly and once we got back to the hotel he got out a very helpfully marked map telling us all the good beaches to go to, how to get to them, and restaurant recommendations. It goes without saying that our bags were carried up to our room for us.Our room was spacious and clean, with a lovely balcony with pool view, and it had everything we needed - including tea and coffee making facilities. The cleaners were fantastic, coming every day and providing fresh linen and towels. The beds were also extremely comfortable which makes a change from some other hotel beds we've stayed in!! Breakfast was great, serving everything you could need - scrambled and boiled eggs, sausage, toast, croissants, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, tea, coffee, and hot chocolate. The breakfast room is also lovely and light and modern. The bar menu in the hotel is also very good, and although we only ate there a couple of times for snacks/light lunches we could not fault it at all. The pool area was fantastically clean, and never felt crowded so you could properly relax. The hotel also provide you with fresh towels whether you are staying by the pool or going to the beach - so next time we wouldn't bring our own! In terms of location, the hotel was perfectly situated around a 10-15 minute walk down to Mykonos town - not that we ever walked it as every time we went down to go for dinner we were offered a lift into town which was great! We always chose to walk back which is quite steep uphill - good exercise for us but there were plenty of taxis if you didn't want to do this. We also decided to hire a quad bike (ATV) for the time that we were there, and would HIGHLY recommend this. It makes it so much easier to get around to all the beautiful different beaches - if this is something you're interested in doing - and gives you a sense of freedom so you aren't so reliant on taxis and buses. We would definitely do this again - and it's good fun too. Last but by no means least, Panos, the owner, was absolutely amazing and constantly went out of his way to make sure that we were happy and didn't need anything further. You could see by the way that he interacted with all the other guests why people come and stay in this hotel year after year. Nothing at all was too much trouble, and he made you feel like one of the family (so that you don't want to leave)! The rest of the team - George, Kostas, Mario, Maria - were also all fantastic and so friendly that it made it very hard to leave. After staying here, I now understand how all of the reviews for this hotel are so positive - you literally cannot fault it.We definitely wish to return here and see you all again.Katerina and Carole",5
"Visited the aeolos on 28th June for 9 nights, had an amazing time. Can  only reiterate what others have said George, kostas, Mario and of course Panos are a fantastic team and I can't thank them enough for a great stay. The hotel is a good 15 minute walk from town, me and my wife went in to town twice a day once in the morning to get the bus to one of mykonos many beaches we visited and once in the evening to go in to town for dinner. Usually George or mario would drive us in to town, and we walk back twice a day, although you can get a taxi back we chose to walk, it is a good walk back up a hill but we seen it as burning them calories off  gained from the beers, wines pitta gyros consumed. Would definitely revisit this hotel again. Once again thank you to Panos a true gentleman who would go out of his way to ensure your stay was a great one, and also to the rest of the team.",2
"Pranos has done an amazing job at setting up such a prestigious and wonderful hotel.From the moment Johnny and I walked into Aeolos we were welcomed like family! Breakfast amazing! Room clean and relaxing. All Staff beautiful and welcoming big shout out to George, Marios and Kostas. Would not recommend to stay anywhere else but Hotel Aeolos.3 star rating is not a true reflection of what you are actually getting!We are already making plans to book for next year so we can see our Greek family once again! And please give a big hug to little Yannis and Maria from us! Love always Johnny and John",0
"What a fantastic hotel! Great friendly staff, clean simple rooms all repainted and well looked after. Reception, lounge and bar all refurbished...beautiful. Pool areas very clean and again very well looked after. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good location, near to town, friendly atmosphere, good accommodation,good food, attentive and friendly staff. Great for relaxation or those wanting to be near enough for town centre shops, nightlife etc.Thank you so much to Pavos and your great staff for a wonderful stay.Chris , Joy and Heidi Hallett (20-27 July 2016)",0
"So its been just under a week since we got back from Mykonos and Hotel Aeleos and they both have sure left their mark - all positive! As I am sat looking out of my window to a dull and grey London, my mind is wishing I was back in sunny Mykonos and the stunning setting of Hotel Aeleos. Can't fault our stay at Hotel Aeleos from the friendly welcome from Mario when he picked up from the airport, to the further welcome from Panos pointing out local area on a map as well as bus times to the beaches (bus stop directly opposite the hotel/also a handy minimarket and fruit shop just next door as well), to the further welcome from George and then from Dimitri who is up in the additional hotel area just up the road where we stayed. The views of the sunset from up there were amazing and were worth delaying going out for dinner later than planned to watch the different stages of colour of the sun before it dropped into to the sea - out of this world! Was a nice treat on our 1st night when Panos spotted us on our walk down to town and got George to drive us down in the minibus. The combination of all of the above, along with our room being of a good standard and a good size for a party of 3 and breakfast which had something for everyone certainly made our stay in Mykonos a memorable one. Thanks Hotel Aeleos, Panos and his team for your hospitality. Wish we were there!!! Zoe",0
"Hotel very well located, with good breakfast, comfortable facilities that met our expectations very well. But the most impressive is the hospitality of the Hotel Owner, Mr. Panos, and his team. Since detailed explanations of what to do on the island, to provide transport to the airport, the center of the island the night, and others. It was amazing.   Room Tip: GReat value and hospitality See more room tips",2
I write as I leave Panos and his team. The hotel is a nice hotel which is well maintained. On our stay breakfast was good and the standards and expectations on everything from cleanliness to presentation were high. We ate in the hotel a couple of times and the food was exactly what we needed. My 5 rating is however based on the level of hospitality and customer service. Panos and the team are an example to others. They would do anything needed to help from advice to transport. The best thing is Panos and his staff genuinely care. In big hotel chains there is that over bearing false customer care which whilst ok can be a bit OTT. Here iris different. Panos makes you feel like you are staying in his house as a friend. Our thanks to everyone. We thoroughly recommend you pay Panos a visit.,1
"There is not many hotels if any that can match this hotel, the service provided is unbelievable, nothing was ever too much for Panos and his team, from picking you up from the airport to even carrying 3 suitcases at the same time after we had checked in, i can see why many people return to the hotel year after year it's because of the homely feel you get, this is made better by the fact that it is not a massive hotel, thank you for a good stay. Its never to early to have a mythos either.",0
"Well this was our 6th visit and it just gets better every time. Panos is always there to go above and beyond anybodies expectations for every second of your stay. The alterations he has done over winter are Amazing.. the hotel is out of this world. The simple elegant design is beautiful. The rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels supplied. From toiletries and a hairdryer to a kettle and cups are in your room. All rooms have air con included Free transfers are normal practice from the airport or the port and dont ever expect to carry your case as Panos George or Marios will always be there to carry them.Breakfast is fantastic with plenty of choice scrambled and boiled eggs, sausage , croissant, bread, jams, chocolate spread, cereal and much more besides. All the food on the menu is cooked to perfection and a good choice is available....... As for the bar Kostas makes a mean cocktail, perfect Mojitos and long island teas and if you walk up to the top bar to take in the sunset Dumitru is also very good with the cocktail shaker :) .The hotel itself is in a great position for getting out and about on the island its a 20 min walk down hill into town and there is a good bus service to get you back if you cant find a taxi. The slouvaki bar next to the hotel if a good choice for a simple cheap meal and the Oregano is a short walk away where the food is fantastic. There is a large selection of good bars and restaurants in town and a multitude of shops to walk round.All in all this is an AMAZING place to stay Panos and his wife Maria and the team they have round them are a well oiled machine who work to ensure your stay is perfect. The ensure your feel like family not guest. We will be back next year without a doubt",1
"The room itself could have used some upgrading (decorating, furniture, etc.), and the breakfast was the worst I had on my 5 week trip around Europe. I actually went out and bought some things to eat instead (all I really wanted was a decent yogurt and carb-y thing, and I heard others complaining because there was only canned fruit). A few bucks could really upgrade the whole experience as it was clear that they chose the cheapest possible stuff - toiletries, ingredients for the food selection, etc. Also, I could have done without the speech from a staff member about how something is ""missing from my life"" because I didn't have casual sex with any men on the island. Otherwise...the location was fine, and the front desk was generally very helpful - especially with shuttles and things. The pool area was nice. It was one of the cheaper places to stay near town, so overall not a bad deal.",1
"Great, stylish hotel with nice pool and great drinks. Very handy for visiting the whole island. Staff and owner friendly and great Craic. Spotless. Quiet. All white decor. Highly recommended. The staff drop you into Mykonos town when necessary.",0
"Once again we decided to return to Mykonos for the fourth time,Never been back to the same hotel so many times. And we were gobsmacked with the changes, The whole dining area has been transformed into a beautifull open plan restaraunt with a whole wall of bi folding windows and stunning lighting...!The reception and lounge area totally re built and the bar is brilliant, But once again it'sthe 'Welcome you recieve as you arrive' That makes the Aeolos so special.Thank you Panos for a wonderfull two weeks we will see you and the best team in Mykonos next may we are returning....!Alan & Lynn",0
I stayed her with my mum in may to have a girly holiday together and we couldn't have had a better trip! The hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. Our room had a terrace overlooking the pool area which caught the sun until it went down making it the perfect spot to sit out on before going out for dinner. The hotel was a short walk into town which was lovely as we were able to see the sunset over Mykonos as we walked down for dinner. Panos and his team would very kindly drive you into town if they were available. All of the staff were very friendly and were more than happy to help you with anything that they could. We also enjoyed some lovely food in the hotel and we especially loved the delicious cocktails which were very kindly delivered to our terrace for us!Fantastic holiday on a fantastic island- we will definitely be back!,0
"Our second visit to Mykonos, didn't think it would be better than our first trip but it was.The improvements made to the Hotel since our first visit provided a larger area for eating and the same level of standards previously set. The big difference was that this visit was like meeting up with friends or our Greek family,The owners of the hotel never found any problem that couldn't be dealt with and this helped anyone who had a problem.The staff throughout were friendly and happy to ensure that Hotel standards were met and exceeded and it would be wrong to pick out any individual as they were all friendly, professional and happy to engage in conversation and give advice on where to go and how to get there.We were met at the airport by Panos, the owner of Hotel, who promptly may as feel as though we had never be away. Hotel is only 5 mins from the hotel so we were quickly shown our room for our stay.Our room was big, roomy and had an outside Patio overlooking the pool.The room was thoroughly cleaned daily,how they work in the heat is incredible. and The bar and lounge areas had also been improved since our last visit, the range of the drinks available in the bar were extensive and well presented, you will see why when you go there. Comfortable seating in the lounge area to relax, watch big screen TV and enjoy the bowl of fresh nuts that were served with every round of drinks.The pool is the place to chill, background music was subtle, water in the pool was chilly but it was in early May.The hotel is a fair walk from the Town centre, going down hill, it is a twenty minute walk depending on which route you follow, albeit that all routes will take you to the Harbour area you can still get lost!!! I would strongly suggest a taxi for the return trip, not expensive but after a meal, a few drinks would you want to walk back to the hotel as it will take you 30 to 40 minutes going uphill.The food available within the hotel is varied, and Panos will highlight the bars and restaurants that you may like to visit onto a map showing the locations.The Hotel is a jewel and the staff make you feel as though are part of a family. Our hotel was great and the holiday was made so special by Panos and the team, thank you to them all, we hope to be back soon.

"My husband stayed in room 126 from 12 - 19 July 2016. This was our 1st time in Mykonos and we had a wonderful time, made all the better by staying at the Aeolos Hotel. I know it's all been said before but the level of service that Panos and his team provide is simply outstanding from the pick up from the airport, the great breakfast, the cleanliness of the rooms and all communal areas of the hotel, the drop off into town at night to the general care that all the staff have that you are enjoying your stay. I have stayed in many exceptional 5 star hotels and I can honestly say that the service that this hotel provides is over an above anything that I have experienced before. I will definitely make a return trip to Mykonos as it is a beautiful island with lots to do and see, and I will have no hesitation in choosing Aeolos Hotel again, hope to see you again soon Panos.Dawn and Paul Taylor",0
"We would like to thank everybody that made our honeymoon even better! Panos thanks for the hospitality ( we will recommend all the Brazilians friends to stay there and bring our wedding samba dancers!!) Dear Dimitri ( thanks do much Dimitri for watching over us, the free peanuts and the amazing drinks - hope you get this message lol) and thanks Mario for the rides and being so friendly ! The hotel is very clean, modern , minimalist and very affordable ! Breakfast is great, everything is fresh and big variety . Room is cleaned everyday and by the end of the day you can watch the sunset by the pool drinking some of Dimitris amazing creations ! We will be back for sure ! Thanks everybody we miss you !   Room Tip: Choose the rooms recently built! See more room tips",0
"On behalf of myself and Beverley we would personally like to thank Panos and all his hard working team for a wonderful and memorable holiday, from the moment you arrive you are made to feel special, loved the service and we cannot find one fault. Special mention for the suite upgrade and for making wife's birthday so special, would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully we will return one day   Room Tip: Try and contact the hotel beforehand as he will allways reply See more room tips",0
"ArrivalWe arrived at Mykonos Airport - Marios was there waiting at arrivals, he insisted that he took the ladies bags. Within 10 minutes we arrived at the hotel and we were greeted by Panos (the owner), he explained about the hotel and showed us a map of the island where the best beaches were, port and a couple of restaurants. We were then taken to our rooms again, our bags taken by Marios. Walking through to our room, the hotel is set out with the lovely white and cornflower blue decor. RoomsRooms are of a good standard, cleaned every day and sheets changed - the rooms were spotless, we had a couple of issues with the toilets but Panos sorted this in minutes, we had the air conditioning on the wrong setting, again sorted within minutes. Like everywhere you travel all rooms have issue's but I don't go on holiday to stay in my room and take photo's of the odd cracked tile! ;0)FoodWe didn't eat a lot at the hotel, but what we did eat was good. Breakfast - the Greek Yogurt is amazing. We had a couple of club Sandwiches, toasties and Crepes all excellent. There is a kebab restaurant next door called Local which is really good and a small mini market the other side of the hotel.DrinksI think I drunk the bar dry of Prosecco, at 6 euros a glass this is great for hotel prices as Mykonos can be very expensive, this was the best price I found on the island. Beer 3.50 euros, Cocktails 10 euros. Georgios our barman by day, Kostas our barman by night are both fabulous, nothing is too much trouble for these boys, although the one thing I was glad to see the back of was the Free Peanuts, it became a standing joke by the end of our holiday.Car HirePanos sorted the car hire out for us and it was delivered to our hotel - 75 euros for the day fully comp, so we could go out and explore the beaches.Mykonos TownMost nights we went into Mykonos, Marios and Georgios always drove us into town free of charge, the town is lovely and reminded me of the streets of Sorrento, you could walk back (i never did) up several steps which were very steep which took about 20 mins, the nightmare is the taxis only 30 to the island, you have to queue for these but it turns into a mass brawl as people queue jump, your normally ok if you go before 12.30am. We ate at some great places - I think Un Con Carne had to be my favourite the steak is amazingOverallOne of the best holidays I have been on, from the hotel, staff, food, drinks and I have to say we met some fab people too. So I would like to say ""Thank You"" to Panos, Maria, Marios, Georgios, Kostas, Maria and the rest of the staff, you were all amazing. See you in 2017 - Mrs Always Right :0)",1
"I was visitting this place the 4th time and i tell you, you dont feel like in a hotel you feel like at home! Panos, the friendliest hotel owner around the world was waiting already for me at the baggage claim in the airport. At the short trip to the hotel he told me about the renovations in winter time - he was not lazy: I found a new bar area, the room for breakfast and the entrance completly renovated. These things you can find somewhere else, but you can't find the exceptional hospitality of Panos and his whole crew. He is reading in your eyes and if it's hot or you are looking tired, he says: ""Come on, we will bring you down to Mykonos"" - you don't have to say anything. Before you are going to a party or to dinner you can enjoy a cool drink at the bar - a beer, a cocktail, a glass of wine or even a bottle of champagne if you are celebrating your birthday. Maria is preparing fantastic food for you, if you are hungry or don't want to go for dinner. I was visitting a lot of places all around the world and i'm visitting Greece since 30 years - but i didn't find any place where im feeling really at home like in Panos' Hotel Aeolos! Come and try - you will come again and again.....",0
"This is an absolute gem of a hotel. It is stylish, immaculate and very comfortable. The rooms are large and finished to an excellent standard, I know this as I got to 'view' three and allowed to pick my favourite! The food is excellent, as are the drinks which are very reasonable. But the jewel in aeolos's crown is the staff. From the moment we were picked up at the port to the moment we left we were made to feel so welcome. The staff are friendly and fun, always ensuring that we are happy and to offer advice on where to go on the island. Panos is a gentleman, as is marios, george and all the other staff. Thank you so much for an excellent stay, I will, most definatly, be back. Yamas!",0
We stayed for three night at Aeolos Hotel & out stay was worth the stay only because of its owner. This man works non stop in every single directions only with the motive of making his guests stay a happy stay! He is an inspiration !Will recommend this hotel because of it owner! Best wishes to them   Room Tip: All rooms are good! See more room tips,0
"Have just returned from an amazing two week stay at Hotel Aeolos and can only say all the complimentary things written about this hotel are true. We have travelled to many different places in Greece and around the world and have never encountered such hospitality and friendship as we received from Panos and his team.Panos is a true gent and works extremely hard to ensure his guests have the best holiday he leads by example and his staff are a credit to him.Thankyou to Marios and George for the many lifts into town, Dimitri for looking after us around the pool and a special thank you to Kostas top barman and a top guy.If you are thinking of going to Mykonos you will not find a better hotel you really do "" enter as strangers and leave as friends"".Thankyou Panos for a wonderful holiday we hope to see you again.Lee & Jo",0
"Me and my boyfriend, both age 20, recently stayed here for a week from 29th June to 6th July 2016. We chose this hotel based on all its amazing reviews and they were all right. We cannot fault it. We have never experienced such personal and caring service from anyone. Panos, George, Mario and all of the team deserve the highest praise. They picked us up from the airport for free, and would give us lifts into town whenever we needed them! They also gave us a free bottle of wine on arrival, left chocolate bars in our room and made our bed into a double when they realised we had two singles. We were amazed by all the lovely gestures like this, they truly go above and beyond to keep their customers happy and always make sure that you're okay. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the hotel is beautiful with a lovely pool, a jacuzzi, sun loungers, beds, bean bags and swinging chairs.The breakfast is really good, lots of variety of food, and it's served until 10:30am which was good for us as we like to sleep in a bit. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the main town, where we would spend most evenings. There is loads to do there, as there is many shops and different styles of restaurants and bars. We also rented a quad bike for a day which I would highly recommend, as we managed to get around a lot of the island and see the beautiful beaches, such as Paradise Beach, Paranga, Kalafatis and Elia which we thoroughly enjoyed. We also went to Paradise Beach for a few evenings as this has amazing night life. We particularly loved Club Tropicana. All in all it was an amazing holiday and we would definitely come back to this beautiful island and amazing hotel! We cannot thank you enough for our wonderful stay. Lots of love Adrianne Goff and Doug Lucking :) xxxx",2
"Panos and his team greeted us like family (it was our second time here) and continued to treat us like kings for the rest of our stay. The rooms are basic but comfortable (Panos is in the process of updating some of them) but the exemplary cleaning team kept them spotless and tidy every day. There's a safe and fridge in each room and the TV has a couple of English news channels. My only gripe would be the Wi-Fi is a little weak in the room; we had to sit outside on our patio to get a decent signal. The pool area is lovely with plenty of sun loungers and a shaded seating area with tables to enjoy an al fresco lunch/drink. Pool towels are provided if required. The breakfast is a little basic (pastries, scrambled egg, cheese and ham slices etc) and could do with more variety, but it does the job of filling you up til lunchtime. The hotel is geared more towards adults than families, I would say, though children are not unwelcome. The guests we've met have all been super-friendly and we all got on and mixed well. The staff are just unbelievably brilliant, they just can't do enough for you. While the location is about half a km outside Mykonos Town they won't hesitate to drop you into town when you want. All in all I can't praise this place enough.",1
"We stayed at this hotel between the 1st of June and the 8th. Sorry for the late review! Staying at this hotel has been hands down the best hotel experience we have had. The food is beautiful with a varied room service menu and the staff make your holiday feel five stars. There was no limit to the excellent service we received. The staff go above and beyond to make sure you are happy, including giving you lifts from the city centre when we were waiting for a taxi in our case! Our room was clean and tidy, it was cleaned daily with fresh towels and bath matts, the air conditioning was a godsend too. Everyone is given a map of the island when you arrive and there are local bus times that take you to different beaches listed in reception. I haven't stayed in a hotel where you are given quite as much help and service as this place. The hotel wifi was also strong in our room (room 120) which was convenient for us. The location is also good, a 10-15 walk into the centre and taxis always available from the centre if you don't fancy walking back afterwards. Overall, I can say that I would recommend this hotel to absolutely anyone and we will be saving up to come back next year! Thank you so much for making our stay so enjoyable.",0
"We stayed at the Aeolos hotel in Mykonos at the beginning of July 2016. It was the last leg of our three weeks holiday. Panos, George, Kostas and the others are amazing. They really make you feel at home. They know your name, they help you whenever they can and have genuine interest in their guests! The hotel areas, room (ours was brand new in scandinavian design style) and pool are good value and well maintained. It's a little bit out of town (15 minutes by foot) but they have the change they'll bring you. We rented a scooter to go to town and secluded beaches to get away from Mykonos-franzy. If you like glamorous beaches go for Kalua at Paranga beach. Anyway, we definitely recommend the Aeolos hotel. We hope to come back at this little gem!",0
"Our second visit to this fabulous hotel and to be greeted by owners Panos and Maria like old friends. We took our friends with us this time and they are eager to return, Panos and all his staff make your holiday the most enjoyable experience on this lovely island. All the returning guests become friends and it was lovely to bump into guests that we had met on our first visit last year.We cant recommend this beautiful place enough and have already booked next years stay. Sarah & Steve",0
"Great staff, couldn't do enough for you to make your holiday special. Pick you up from the airport, drop you into town, nothing was too much trouble . Nice comfortable room - good to have a fridge too. Town itself full of lovely winding alleys, great restaurants, nice bars and the sunset ...... awesome!!!<U+2600><U+FE0F><U+2600><U+FE0F><U+2600><U+FE0F>",0
"This is our third stay at Aeolos Hotel, we first went in June 2014 and had no hesitation in returning last year and again this June. We stayed for two weeks and had a wonderful relaxing holiday. We plan to go back again next year and would not even consider staying anywhere else in Mykonos. The welcome you receive from Panos, Maria and all the staff (and this year little Yanis) is second to none. They make the stay very special and nothing is too much trouble. We were met at the airport by them and personally transferred to the hotel where our rooms, the service, the pool and the hospitality was fantastic as always. We met a few friends and people we had met in previous years and this is a common theme with this hotel......people always return! Thankyou Panos, Maria and all the staff for your hospitality and friendship during our stay and we will definitely see you again. Looking forward to next year already.

"I can't recommend this hotel enough. We stayed for a short 4 day break in July based on the great reviews here on Trip Advisor. The Location is perfect, 10 minutes from the airport. A 20 minute walk or 5 minute taxi to the center of town. Its a steep climb back up to the hotel from town so some might want to take a 5€ taxi. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Panos and his team really make this hotel what it is and it represents great value for money. The rooms are clean and functional with good free wifi. The simple buffet breakfast is great. I would book this hotel again without hesitation.",0
We only went for our usual short break to unwind for a few days and have stayed at various hotels all of which we have been happy with but pannos and his staff are fab.nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with a huge smile and a friendly handshake.we are very quiet people and they respected our privacy and we left feeling so pampered and refreshed it was a lovelly experience from start to finish.huge thank you to the lovely dimitri at the new part of hotel he looked after us so well and makes a wicked cuppa and toast on request lol.really we have to say thank you to everyone for a superb service.just sorry we couldn't get rebooked for our August visit but no surprise they are fully booked.   Room Tip: Rooms at the new part of hotel are quiet and beautiful view with doubke sofa beds for two people ver... See more room tips,0
"I can't recommend this hotel enough. The rooms are spotless, as are all areas of the hotel. The breakfast provided is continental and has a lovely variety.I've read reviews where guests have been annoyed about the walk into town. I can appreciate it isn't a great road to walk down in the evening but this was never an issue for us. Panos (the owner) always offered us a lift into town when we needed it. I liked that the hotel was set a little way from the main town as I wanted some peace and quiet to relax on my holiday.The thing that makes this hotel so special is Panos and his team, we were made to feel like family throughout our trip. Nothing was too much trouble and my friend and I didn't have to lift a finger once whilst relaxing around the pool. I have been to larger and more luxurious hotels throughout the world and I would chose the Aeolos over every one of them. There we weren't treated as a 'conveyor belt' of guests churning through the hotel with charmless service. We were all treated as individuals with individual requirements.Panos - The hotel and your team are a credit to you, I loved every minute of my stay with you all and I hope to be back again next year.Kostas - You make the best cocktails (which is why I never stuck to the same drink!)Marios - Thank you for making us smile and laugh on a daily basisGeorge - An absolute gentleman   Room Tip: Ground floor rooms have larger 'balcony' areas to sit outside See more room tips",0
"Aeolos Hotel was perfect for us. A short 5-10min walk down the hill to the centre of Mykonos Town was no problems. The hotel itself was very nice, great views, extremely friendly staff and excellent rooms. They also provided us with a free transfer to and from the dock. Would stay here again!",0
"What a wonderful experience fromStart to finish these guys show great warm't and work very hard , panos the owner was fantastic , Marius , George and kostas however make the experience the most enjoying and I for one will be comming back ASAP I just hope those guys will still be there , the resort it's self it's uber chic great food and drinks you just gotta get a visit in here .",0
"Where do I start. There are so many positive things to say. So I will start at the beginning. Arrived at the airport to be greeted by Mario, what a character. He made us feel relaxed & welcome as soon as we left the airport. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by Panos the owner. Well there are no words to describe this gentleman, he has an excellent way with customers. Bearing in mind we had never been to this hotel before & he treated us like friends. This continued throughout our stay. Nothing is too much trouble. His aim to make your holiday an amazing experience & he achieves this. He does this supported by a great team of people. Kostos, George, Maria Mario & his lovely wife Maria. The hotel is spotlessly clean. Rooms are spacious & airy. With the added luxury of air conditioning. Breakfast is continental & plenty of it. Pool area is lovely with plenty of beds to choose from. The location is only 10 minutes from the town & it nice be away from the hustle & bustle. There is always the offer of a lift to the town if required. Taxis back cost 5 euro. Panos your hotel is the Jewel in the Crown. Thanks again from Judy & Gill.I can only suggest that people don't just read the reviews of this hotel. But experience it's excellent hospitality.   Room Tip: Room 129 has a lovely sea view. See more room tips",0
"All the staff are relaxed and treat you like they have known you for years, rather than like a paying customer. If there is anything you need, they will cater for all your needs, it was like a second home. Its close to the town and central to get to other parts of Mykonos. We were given a free upgrade and they just made our stay amazing. Love this place!",0
"Just came back from four nights staying at Aeolos Hotel where we had a lovely time. The hotel is as good as all the reviews indicate. It offers very good value for money with good facilities; the pool is a real bonus, particularly as most Mykonos hotels in the centre of town do not have them. The most outstanding feature of the hotel though is the staff team themselves. Panos as the manager works harder than any hotel manager I've ever come across - and I travel quite a bit. He seems genuinely interested in all his customers, no matter how long they stay, nothing seems too much trouble. Marios and George are equally friendly and helpful, offering us lifts into town whenever they were free. A lot of comments have been made about the walk which I guess could take up to 10 minutes, especially if you were regularly stopping off to take photos along the way! The route is a little rough (so no high heels) but was pleasant enough and helps build up an appetite. My partner and I did it most days, and on a couple of occasions walked back, which was OK in the cool of the evening - and I'm 55 so it's not impossible! If you don't want to walk back however the taxi fare is only €5 and the wait is no more than about 5 - 10 minutes even on a busy night, and there are shaded seats available at the taxi rank. The drive back is only 2-3 minutes. I was glad the hotel was not in the centre of town which I can imagine must be noisy till quite late; the rooms were comfortable and we always had a good night's sleep. I should also mention that the rooms were well cleaned with beds made and fresh towels daily, even though we had not requested them; I believe the cleaner was Matilda, who though spoke little English, was friendly and thorough in her work.If you need more than sunbathing, shopping, dining and partying on your holiday then I would recommend a half day trip to Delos, where there are plentiful Ancient Greek ruins with famous myths attached; Apollo, Artemis, Leto etc. It was €50 pp for the whole excursion, including the return boat trip, museum entrance and guide - very good value for money. We went in the morning when the weather was cooler - Panos drove us down as near to the port as he could and gave us a large bottle of ice-cold water which was much appreciated. All in all it was a lovely few days thanks primarily to Panos and his team.",0
"This was our 3rd stay at the hotel in the last 4 years, we love it here so much, the way in which panos and his staff look after you is first class, we stayed at the Aeolos Art hotel which is stunning, Dumitru the barman is such a lovely guy and looked after us extremely well, Mario who picked us up from the airport is a lovely guy too, always smiling and happy, there had been a few improvements to the hotel since we where here in 2014, an extended breakfast area and some additional rooms, all looked great and just adds to the class of this place. Our last 3 days where spoilt a little by a young wedding party who checked in, they unfortunately took over the place and were rough and noisey, they turned the pool area into club 18-30, this is not the usual clientele the hotel attracts and we have never experienced this here before, this was no fault of the hotel it was just unfortunate we happened to be staying here the same time as them, it hasn't put us off staying here in the future. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fantastic small and friendly hotel with the most excellent hospitality, you won't regret it! Thank you panos once again, you and all your staff make the hotel first class, Lee, Simon, Tony and Mark xxxx",0
"We have just had 11 wonderful nights at The Aeolos Hotel !!

"Panos and his staff and their generous hospitality never cease to amaze us. There is a special magic to this hotel which brings guests back, year after year. Over the winter they have put a lot of work into upgrading the hotel, it's really paid off, as it looks great. Every year the Aeolos just gets better and better (this is our forth visit!) We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to returning for another stay soon!",0
"stayed here for a week and the hotel was lovely...had a great room 128 with a big balcony overlooking the sea...greeted by warm and friendly smile at the airport and taken back to hotel where we had a brief intro to the hotel and island. room was spotless and it was a bit embarrassing seeing panos struggling up the stairs with our cases when we were very capable, but that he what he is like...a gent who values his guests.....room was spotless with safety deposit box and air con as standard..no hidden extras. You could have pool towles but we had brought our own so used them, only one day was th pool area too crowded for us and then we just stayed on our balcony instead...i am sure if we had asked they would have found u a bed, but i dont always lik to be a pain :)....food is served all day with a basic breakfast which was great for me til 1030 so could have a lie in...i love greek cake adn yoghurt and fruit so i was happy, still havent quite got used to the milk in my tea over there so stuck with coffee. Lunch and dinner can be had at hotel, but we chose most days to go out into town, a 15 min walk downhill bit rough terrain so dont go wearing best heels, the hotel will take you down as well if you ask, which we decided to walk most days to work up appetite...only issue is walk back is all uphill so not for the faint hearted...we did it moist nights as there was a silly wait for taxis most nights (when it was much qucker for us to walk)which is only 5 euros but one couple at the weekend had 1.5hr wait fo a taxi (we never had this trouble, most waited was around 35min)...so the hotel was lovely there were a couple of things i would change, but these are nothing to do with how its run, and is generally outside of the hotels control so have not marked them down..1) location - would love a few more tavernas locally or not hill to walk up2) Location - the hotel is under the flight path of the airport so you do get regular noise and close views of the underbelly of plans all day...otherhalf didnt notice it too much, but was a little annoyance3) the bleeding cockrells nearby didnt undertstand when to be quiet :) we loved them really but did make us chuckle when it didnt matter what time of the day or night they corwed anyway :)SO in summary the hotel was great and couldnt ask for more and they do the island a good service...if we came back to mykonos we would consider coming back, but not sure mykonos town is for us as its a little too busy and touristy. thanks to all at the hotel for making us feel welcome and treating us well   Room Tip: 128 has a view out to the seafront See more room tips",0
"Never in all of my travels both back home in Australia or abroad I have received such outstanding service. From the moment my Partner and I arrived for our 3 nights at Aeolos, Panos and his staff went above and beyond for not only us but everyone else who was staying at the same time. At check in we were presented with a map of the island, with Panos running through and highlighting all the points of interest. A car was organised to take us to the ATV rental company and we were even given a lift into town one night at no cost to save the walk - a saviour to my partner who was in heels. The hotel is a 10-15 min walk from the city centre and anything else you need is literally at your doorstep - fruit markets, shops etc. we had dinner one night at Oregano around the corner about 400m, I highly recommend that too.All in all Panos could not have done any more to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable. I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Very easy to see why it is ranked the no.2 hotel on the island. My only disappointment was Panos was not around before we had to catch our ferry back to Athens so I could buy him a beer to say thanks!Thank you to everyone involved at Aeolos Hotel",2
"Panos and team run a gem. This hotel embodies everything customer service should be about - it's a gentle check in with you whenever they see you to make sure all is well and to see if they can do any more to make your stay more enjoyable, keeping the kitchen open when our ferry was late, seeing that almost everyone there was a repeat customer - or said they would be back. I'm lucky enough to have stayed in some far more expensive places around the world and I can't think of a time I have felt more welcomed or better looked after by the place I was staying. I cannot imagine going back to Mykonos and staying anywhere else... Thanks guys for a great few days..",1
We only stayed one night and wish we would have stayed longer. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the owner goes out of his way to make sure all of your needs are met. The rooms are very clean and large. The swimming pools inviting and the views are wonderful.,0
"Having landed in Mykonos after a long 8 hour journey, we arrived at our original accommodation and discovered that it was still under construction! To our disappointment, there was no pool and we were greeted by the sound of loud machinery and banging :-(Luckily, we managed to find alternative accommodation, and found Aeolos Hotel at the last minute online. When we arrived, we explained what had happened to the welcoming manager Panos, who completely took the weight off our shoulders from thereon as his staff carried our luggage to our room.With his warm smile and genuine approach, Panos and his colleagues ensured that our stay was everything we wanted and more. Our air conditioned bedroom was clean, modern and had a balcony overlooking the beautiful swimming pool.Whether we wanted information about directions to town, quad bike rentals, restaurants or the best beaches to visit, Panos and his team went above and beyond to ensure we made the most out of our stay in the beautiful island of Mykonos. Aeolos Hotel turned our holiday from hell into holiday to remember, and we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.Thank you Panos from the bottom of our hearts! :-)Luke and Katie, from Sydney",0
"We have just returned from the most incredible 10 days in Mykonos, and the main reason for our excellent holiday is the Aeolos Hotel and its staff. From the second we were greeted at the airport by Panos, the hotel’s wonderful owner, to the second we left, we were treated like absolute royalty and nothing was too much trouble (literally, Panos actually thrives on you asking him ‘difficult’ questions to challenge him!)It’s hard to put into words just what a magical hotel the Aeolos is, but to say we’ve come home with a tear in our eye and Mykonos in our hearts would be an understatement. The sign on reception says ‘Enter as strangers, leave as friends’ and if you book to stay here you will experience for yourself just how true this is. Just one example is that we were trying to book ferry tickets for a trip to Naxos online and asked for help… 30 seconds later we were in the car being driven to the port to book our tickets. Next morning, we were taken to the port and collected again when we returned. Superb, 5* service all round. The rooms at the Aeolos are kept spotlessly clean with maid service daily. The bar is well stocked and the barman a fantastic asset to the team. Try the Long Island Iced Tea if you like strong cocktails!My only advice if you are considering booking this hotel is, DO IT NOW, or you’ll regret it!To Panos, Maria, Maria, Costas & Marios – efcharisto. To the many new friends we met on our amazing break – yamas!",0
"Owner and staff the best we have come across in Greece, embarrassed to ask for information or help as they just sorted it for you or took you there no matter what.The hotel is excellent, wanted for nothing, a credit to Mykonos and the Greek tourist industry, will be back.",0
"We have just come home, after one of the best holidays I've ever had, we've been going to Mykonos for 28 years, and the Aeolos has been the friendliest and best hotel I've stayed at on the island, thanks to the owner and staff, who can't do enough for everyone, the guests our a mixture of mature to young , gay to straight ,and mainly English, who all take time to talk to each other, the whole complex, which is only small , Has a lovely atmosphere, you can feel it as soon as you arrive, every one friends each other, no matter what they are , which we've never came across, on any of our travels, And I'll talk to anyone, we've never go back to the same place twice, but we're definitely going back, Not for Mykonos, which has lost its identity, Dude to the cruise ships, and extortionate prices in the town , But I'll be going back to the Aeolos, just for that ! A lovely friendly hotel, fantastic staff , that could be anywhere in Greece , thanks panos , for making us feel special , Yama's",1
"Our first visit to this beautiful place and one we will never forget. This was mine and my partners first proper holiday together and so glad we stayed here. A quiet little hotel with gorgeous rooms placed in the right place to get anywhere. What makes this place though is the amazing staff. Panos, Mario, George and Costas go above and beyond in making you feel safe and welcome. All so friendly and warm they will make sure your needs are met and I genuinely miss all of them! Pick up and drop off to the airport with lifts into town at night. If you want a quad or scooter (which I strongly suggest) they give the guys a call and you will be picked up and taken to the place to get one. We met so many amazing people here and it just made our holiday, lovely pool and jacuzzi great food and drinks and always service with a smile and crazy conversations and laughs. Wanted to cry when we left but have promised to come back again and if we do we will be staying here!",2
"We enjoyed 10 days of pure relaxation in this lovely hotel. The rooms are well appointed and well furnished. The on site restaurant is so good we dined in every evening and enjoyed the varied menu. Although located on a busy road, it was an oasis of peace and calmness once through the doors. The double glazed windows kept out any noise from late night revelers. There's a lovely pool area with plenty of sun beds with shaded areas when needing to get out of the sun. The public rooms are furnished in a modern style. Every thing is kept in a pristine condition. There was a mixture of age groups when we were there. Young and old mixed very well and everyone was very friendly. The happy and relaxed atmosphere was thanks to efforts made by the owner Panos and his staff. Panos is a very hands on owner who greets his guests at breakfast to ask if they'd had a good night's sleep. What ever you ask for his reply is always ""of course"". I will say that we have never received such care and attention to the level that we received at the Hotel Aeolos. We were in need of complete rest so we did not venture very far but there was plenty to do for those wanting to be more active. The hustle and bustle of the town is not too far away and beaches can be reached by taking a bus out side the door. I don't think the hotel is really suitable for little children - it is more an adults place. We met many guests who were making a return visit - we intend to go back in the near future.   Room Tip: All rooms have a pleasant outlook - we prefer a first floor room See more room tips",1
"I have just returned from the Aeolos, fabulous boutique hotel on Mykonos and cannot praise it enough. Rooms cleaned, sheets and towels replaced on a daily basis (thank you to our wonderful cleaner). Tea/coffee making facilities and fridge in room. Great choice of breakfast, drinks and meals. Amenities/communal areas spotless, truly stylish and beautiful. Close to restaurants, a small 'department store' across the road, turn left out of the hotel and 5 mins away you will find a hairdresser, a small cafe where they make home made Turkish delight, a bakery and a supermarket. However like the rest of the reviews on here I have to assure anyone reading this that it is Panos and his team who make this hotel that extra bit special. Panos is extremely chilled and his hospitality is second to none. A very experienced, hands on owner/manager who knows the hotel business and how to treat his guests. Ask him anything you need to know. At checkin you will be presented with a map, a detailed explanation of the island and recommendations whether it be re beaches, trips or restaurants (I recommend the boat trip to Delos, island of light and one of the most mythological, historical and archaeological sites in Greece, birthplace of Apollo. Once a bustling ancient city and trading port now abandoned and party crumbled into the sea, a magical place but don't forget your hat there is no shelter and it is extremely hot. Also the small boat 'taxi' which visits many of the beaches giving views of Mykonos along route to die for. The 'boys' at the hotel Kostas and Mario (the latter not a full god as one review mentioned but a self confessed demi god) are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble always willing to help everyone with a smile whether it be serving you drinks, food, carrying bags, transporting you to the airport or giving lifts down the hill to town if you are too tired to walk the 10 minutes it takes on foot. This team make you relax as soon as you walk through the door, they make sure you stay that way until you leave. Go, you will not regret it 'enter as strangers, leave as friends'. Thank you Panos, we will be back. Best Wishes and Hi to you all Ruth and Lesley, Hereford UK x",1
"I have been ALL over the world and stayed in some amazing places but AEOLOS HOTEL has to be the best hotel I have EVER stayed in especially when it comes to customer service and relaxation. We were met at the airport by the very helpful very lovely Marios who drove us on the short trip back to the hotel. (this is a free service offered by the hotel). Upon arrival Panos met us and provided us with some fantastic information about the island and what it has to offer which was very helpful. We were then shown our rooms by the lovely Kostas :-) Our room was great - decent size, lovely bathroom & all the amenities and space needed for a holiday.We ate out most nights but on reflection we should have just had our evening meal at the hotel as the food & drinks served there were better than most of the restaurants in town and most definitely better value for money. The pork Gyros here are the best in Mykonos!Breakfast at the hotel was continental and there was lots of choice with it depending on your own tastes i would say there is something for everyone.This hotel has something more than clean rooms and a nice pool there is a really special feeling about it and it is down to the way Panos and the team treat you from the minute you arrive to the minute you are taken back to the airport. The feeling resonates throughout the guests who stay and everybody just has a great time. We met some great people on this holiday and that made our stay even more special! You all know who you are :-)Mykonos & Hotel Aeolos you will see us again soon. I have a feeling Jon-Paul & I will be coming back for years to come. Thank you Panos, Maria, Maria, Marios, Kostas & of course the gorgeous Yannis for a truly amazing holiday :-)",3
We stayed at Aeolos in June 2016 for 1 week. Very cozy room and the hotel is fully renovated. Panos and his staff are always extremely helpful and bending backwards for client satisfaction. Bus stop to Elia and Kalafati beaches in front of the hotel. 10 minutes walking down to the city or €5 taxi ride. Breakfast is good and if you want to enjoy their menu at night you won't be disappointed.I highly recommend Aeolos: you will feel like home. Two thumbs up. Hope to come back again soon.,0
"What more can I say about Aeolos that has not already been said?! My husband and I returned on Wednesday from a 7 night stay at this wonderful hotel and I only wish we were back there now! We were met at the airport by the lovely Panos and Mario and taken on the very short journey to the hotel. Our room was just perfect (room 128), with great views and in a lovely quiet location. The food at the hotel was fantastic, the Greco pizza and cheeseburger were definite favourites and all at very reasonable prices. What made this holiday so special however were the people...Panos, Maria, Maria, Mario and Kostas (plus the ladies who keep the hotel so spotlessly clean) are just simply the best in the business. We were treated to such warm hospitality that we truly feel we have made genuine friends. I also have to mention the other lovely guests who were staying at the hotel during the same week, they helped make this a week we will never forget and we will most definitely be back soon Panos! Thank you! Jo and John, Liverpool x",2
"We stayed for 3 nights this week at the start of our island hopping holiday. We were collected from the airport on arrival and taken down to the ferry port by the hotel staff when we left.The hotel is out of town on a main road but it is quiet and easy enough to walk into town. We are in our 60's but walked both ways but you can always get a bus or a taxi back up the hill. The reception and bar area, along with the restaurant face the road which ensures that the rooms are quiet. The layout of the reception areas provided a good meeting point to socialise with fellow guests if you so wished. Our room was functional and spacious and had a nice sunny terrace. Wifi was free and quite good.There is a pool area with a variety of sun beds/loungers. Food and drink was available all day.Buffet breakfast was the same every day but plentiful.The real joy of this hotel is Panos (the owner) and his staff. It would be difficult to imagine a problem or issue arising that Panos would not or could not help with..",2
"We arrived from Santorini on the very efficient ferry. We were met by Mario from the hotel who took us on the 5 minute journey to the hotel (free of charge). Once we arrived we met Panos the owner, who explained all about Mykonos town, places of interest and recommended a handful of restaurants. Our cases were taken to our room. The room was lovely. the shower was perfect and the beds very comfortable. We were overlooking the pool which for us was perfect. Our room was kept lovely and clean by the friendly maids.The pool area has a very relaxing atmosphere and just the place to chill out with a good book. The bar food is also really good, from burger to sandwiches to main meals. One of our favourites was the club sandwich. All very reasonably priced.Breakfast is served from 8 to 10.30 and has everything you need to set you up for the day. Maria the lady who looks after breakfast keeps everything topped up and spic and span. She's a credit to the hotel.The evening bar is run by another very helpful young man Costas. He's a new member to the Aeolos team - what a nice guy !Mario and George who took it in turns to take us down into Mykonos town go out of their way to help. Thank you.Panos - you've got a fantastic hotel. We had an amazing time. Your staff are a real credit to you. They've learnt off the master ! Thank you for a wonderful holiday. We'll be back.",0
"I don't usually return to the same holiday destination, but I couldn't wait to go back to the Aeolos again this year. Panos and his team have updated some areas of the hotel and it was even better than the first visit. All the staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble and the warmth and enthusiasm with which they look after guests is really impressive. thank you Panos - we will be back!Ali, Chaffey and Dad   Room Tip: I prefer the Aeolos Art area - spectacular views from the pool.

We have returned from our third trip to the hotel it's excellent very well run clean and the owner is most helpful and friendly we will go back again The pool is good and hotel nice size a must for couples and families great place   Room Tip: All rooms are well sited with most having pool view lower floor rooms have slightly larger private f...

"We were recommended this hotel after friends of ours stayed last summer and aeolos didn't disappoint. Upon arrival we were offered a beautiful room upgrade as we were celebrating a special occasion. Beautiful sea views (unlike main building although this also has lovely pool area) bar with the most attentive guy called dimitri for whom nothing was too much trouble. We spent every day of our 3 day trip around the lovely pool and dimitri was great to talk to.Panos the owner cannot be praised enough, this is a guy who knows how to make people feel welcome and special. The lunch menu was delicious, Greek salad, grilled meat, toasted sandwiches etc all reasonably priced too. The buffet breakfast was simple but plentiful and tasty. The walk down to mykonos town was enjoyable and all downhill (15 mins) but we got a taxi back every night as didn't fancy uphill. The hotel provides a really good map with taxi rank marked out and other points of interest. We will definitely be back to aeolos x",0
"On arrival we were met with a warm, sincere welcome by Panos the hotel owner. It was the same throughout the stay, all the staff we incredibly welcoming, genuine and kind.The hotel is situated close to Mykonos town (Chora) which is a delight to walk around day or night and is full of great restaurants. Captains was our favourite, situated toward the far left of the harbour near a blue domed church. Taxis cost 5 euros each way but someone from the hotel staff often dropped us off which was very kind. The hotel food was also great, especially at lunch time after a morning dip in and out of the pool and laying on the quality sun loungers that don't trap your fingers or collapse :0) The rooms are simple clean and provide everything you need for a stay on a small Island.After our stay we had booked an apartment further down the Island but took up Panos' offer and came back daily to use the pool and eat lunch. He genuinely made us feel just as welcome as day guests!All in all a great place, great people on a great Island. Thank you Panos. We will be back!",0
Coming to Mykonos and seeing our friends every year is a great joy . 12 nights of chilling and chatting in the best hotel in Mykonos . Our visits seem to get better and better every year . We are glad to have friends like Panos Maria Georgina and our new friend the Greek god Mario . All the staff go above and beyond. The welcome is impeccable. We meet old friends Lynn Alan which we shared a few drinks with and had the best time . A stunning place with beautiful people see you all again soon .,1
"What an amazing hotel! .We are in the middle of an 8 day stay here and i feel compelled to tell everybody about this place. We have stopped in hotels all over the world and this comes at the very top of the hundreds we have stayed in. We were picked up from the airport by Mario,who is very knowledgeable about the island. Once arriving at the Aeolos, we were greeted by the owner Panos. A completely chilled man who makes you feel totally at home. They really go out of their way to make sure your holiday is a wonderful experience. They will always drive you into town if needed and refuse to be tipped for their troubles. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The aircondioning is a doddle to use too. Breakfast is of a high standard with excellent fresh coffee and bread amongst other things, served every day. A really wonderful hotel that I can thoroughly reccomend. We will be back...",1
"This was our first stop on a two week island hoping holiday and it'll be hard for anywhere to live up to the standard set by the Aeolos hotel and their team of friendly staff. The owner Pano greeted us warmly on arrival and informed us of all we needed to know. Marios was extremely helpful with the shuttle service and was an excellent person to have meet guests on arrival to the port. We were given a choice of two rooms on arrival, one in the main building and the second was a two minute walk down the road in a complex with several newly built rooms. We chose the second room which had an excellent view of the island. The room was fantastic, nice and spacious and only five seconds from the pool. Huge sundbeds were a lovely touch as well as was Dimitrius. He looked after the complex we were staying in and was extremely helpful and always friendly helping us whenever we needed something. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was lovely so can't comment much on the food. Pano did suggest several places for lunch and dinner which we tried and were never disappointed especially with the restaurant oregano located just around the corner to the hotel. On departure despite our short stay Pano said he was sorry to see us go, a sentiment shared by myself and my girlfriend. Keep you the good work guys, will be back if we ever travel to mykonos again.",0
"We stayed here for a week and we had an amazing time! The owner is so nice, he will accept u as if ur part of his family. The pool is in pristine condition, the food is amazing (have the pizza!) and the cocktails are better than any bar in town. We loved every second of our stay! Don't hesitate..... Book! 10/10 <U+2764><U+FE0F>",0
"We just left our 3 night, 4 day stay in Mykonos and were absolutely floored by how incredible the staff at Aeolos was. Led by the owner Panos, everyone is extremely helpful and accommodating and they go above and beyond to make your vacation the best possible. We had many good recommendations given to us on where to eat and drink throughout the island. This was most definitely the best hotel staff that my boyfriend and I have ever come across. Everything was great - the rooms, drinks, food (including the complimentary breakfast buffet!), etc. Our vacation here was amazing and we couldn't thank the staff enough for being so helpful and welcoming the entire time!",0
"Dear Pano, thanks again to you and your team for the wonderful welcome back to Aeolos Mykonos. I don't think your hotel can be beaten for the facilities, the reception you provide and the value for money. My friends all now agree with me! Please give our thanks to Maria, Giorgos, Marios, Pavlina and the rest of the team for the care and attention they gave to us. Especial thanks to Dumitru for the fabulous service with a smile he always gives. He made our stay. I'm sure I'll be back again with you as soon as I possibly can. Have a great season, all the very best, Deb   Room Tip: Personal preference is for Aeolos Art, with the sunset views of Mykonos Town See more room tips",0
"I came to this hotel after sailing the Cyclades. I was picked up from the port absolutely no issues. The hotel is fantastic, great rooms, great pool. Lovely staff, panos very welcoming. Mario did a great job carrying my bags around and collecting me from the port and taking me to the airport and Demitri was faultless making sure I had drinks and food around the pool. Amazing continental breakfast every morning, I was even invited to breakfast when I turned up at 10:45am the first morning which I didn't expect and was kind of Panos. I would say to anyone this is the best place to stay in to stay in Mykonos. You'll find a big difference in price and the town is 10minutes walk down a path. What goes down has to come up though and the walk back up can be hard but take your time or get a taxi for 5 euro. There are also restaurants and a supermarket near the hotel. The last night I watched the sunset from the pool side it was amazing.",0
"many many thanks to my dear friend panos,and all the fantastic staff maria, Mario ,George and all the lovely kitchen acleaning ladies for making our stay so memorable ,we were made to feel part of the family straight away ,a lovely chilled bottle of wine a 2 glasses waiting for us on arrival , bags fetched to the room , rooms delightful a spotless and the breakfast amazing, scrambled eggs a olives cheeses , hams cake , jams and best of all the best greek yoghurt ive ever tasted yum yum .really nice pool area a hot pool spa was a bonus.

"We have just returned from a 7 day break staying at this hotel, we arrived at the airport to be greeting by the lovely Mario, who was kind & charming, it was a super welcome to the Island.Upon arrival at the reception, Panos (owner) greeted us, told us about the resorts & places of interest, gave us a map pin pointing the two. Centre etc. Basically had time to talk to us, rather than just check us in.Mario took our cases to our rooms with complementary wine!The hotel was very clean & modern and charming, we had room 124, which I really liked as I could see the pool, jacuzzi and bar.Security boxes are free.The pool wasn't heated so I have to say it's the first time I've not been in the pool on holiday, my friends went in, but I like a pool to be on the warmer side. Jacuzzi was lovely. Pool area & bar area very nice.Panos, Mario, George & the team make this hotel incredibly special, they work extremely hard but not in s stressed way. They are friendly charming & happy.Often Mario would drop us into town to save a 15 min walk, I've never known a hotel to that.We will be coming back.Places we liked:We went to the piano bar in little Venice which is cute brilliant atmosphere with live singer.Hippy fish, where they filmed Shirley Valentine, music very Ibiza chilled,good food & great sunbeds.Jackie o's - expensive but lovely.Onnos beach beautiful And lastly, didn't get chance to go to Scorpios beech club or Lola's cocktail bar - but that's for next time! Meant to be good.",0
"This was my first trip to Mykonos, and my first ever solo trip, so I was a little nervous. But when I landed , the lovely Mario was there to meet me and take me to the hotel. Once at the hotel Panos ( the lovely owner) introduced himself, and ran through the hotel information plus a map of the town, highlighting all the places I may want to see. I was given a choice of rooms, and chose to stay at the Arts annexe , just 150m walk away from the main hotel . It is beautiful, with amazing seaviews - just 12 rooms, with its own pool and plenty of sunbeds and daybeds. This is run by the absolutely delightful Dumitru- who with his smiley face, cheeky laugh and impeccable customer service, really does make your holiday. He is an absolute star! The bar is open 12pm until 12am daily, where you can get drinks and snacks. Breakfast is served in the main hotel, and has a good selection to cater for everyone. The room I had was huge, and brand new with everything you would need. A massive king bed, a fab rain shower, fridge, safe & free wifi. A kettle is provided if you need one. Outside the room are table and chairs on your own private terrace, overlooking the pool. The walk down into town was easy - via the path at the Shell garage, and took no more than 10 mins. I did walk back up a couple of times in the day - it's good exercise to walk off all that lovely Greek food and wine! In the evening you can just grab a cab back up which is only €5. Mykonos town is beautiful- a real little maze, with so many lovely restaurants, bars and shops to choose from. If you can, I would avoid going when the big Cruise ships are in town (there were 4 in when I went the first time) it makes it rather busy when they are! But as soon as the day trippers have all gone back to ship, the town returns to a delightful place to explore. I was only booked to stay at the hotel for 3 nights, as the hotel was full for the remaining nights I needed - but Panos sorted it for me, and managed to let me stay an extra 3 nights, which I was so grateful for - as I didn't want to leave! Thank you Panos :) I really did have the best time at the hotel - customer service is the best I have come across, everyone knows your name and it really did feel like home for 6 nights. A HUGE thank you to Panos, Dumitru, Mario and all the other staff at the hotel- it was an amazing holiday made more special by you all. I can definitely say my first ever solo trip was a huge success , and I will definitely be returning for sure :) Sarah x",1
"After our small tour of Santorini we were looking forward to coming back to Mykonos.We found this hotel on booking.com and couldn't believe the price for Mykonos town! Pros:Amazing service in the hotel, nothing was too much trouble for them Nice pool areaRooms were spotlessly clean Whole hotel was spotlessly cleanThey would drop you off in the town when you wanted Free transfers from the port/airport Oregano restaurant around the corner is AMAZING for the price!! Only €5 for a taxi ride from the town to the hotel",0
This is a wonderful hotel and is also reasonably priced. The personal service from Panos ( the owner) makes all the difference. The rooms are very pretty and spotlessly clean if quite basic. The breakfast room is beautiful and the quality of the breakfast itself superb. I will certainly recommend Hotel Aeolos to anyone visiting Mykonos,0
"This is a great hotel - unfortunately we were only able to stay there for 2 days. A couple other guests we spoke with have been returning for several years. The hotel is very comfortable, has a great pool area, and the meals (both breakfast buffet and off the menu) are good. The owner and staff are very helpful and try to ensure you have a pleasant, hassle free stay. Its locations is an easy walk to the town center and there is ample on site parking if you happen to have a car.We hope to be able to return for a longer stay!   Room Tip: I believe all rooms have a pool view and are quiet. See more room tips",0
"In the dictionary definition of boutique hotel, there should be a picture of Boheme. Everything about it is 5 star; rooms, staff, views, food, drinks at the bar, service, etc. We went from Mykonos to Santorini and the view and sunset in Santorini that people wait in crowds for, is a nightly occurrence from the bar at Boheme. Grab a drink, watch the sunset and be in paradise. As others have said, it is a short, fun walk into town which, in my view, is the best town in all of the Greek isles. There is nothing the staff won't do and they do it all well; reserve a car, a boat cruise, hunt for luggage lost at the airport, etc. Just a great place. We had a Boheme suite, which is big, has a private hottub and great view of the water and sunset.",3
The best. Awesome view. Awesome service. Delicious breakfast. The staff each and everyone fabulous.A homely yet professional atmosphere.A must place to visit often.We thank you kindly.A holiday of a lifetimeThank you,1
"Amazing hotel.While Mykonons was filled with energy, fun and partying (which I love), Boheme was a great contrast to all of that as it gave me a quiet and relaxing retreat to stay when I returned from all of the crazy.Staff is amazing (Mohammad...shout out to you!), food (particularly the breakfast) was top notch and the pool is excellent. Room was spacious and cleaned 2x per day, and the staff genuinely gets to know you.Only drawback is it's about a 5-10 minute walk from the city, on a busy street with no sidewalk, so you take a bit of a risk in doing that. But the drivers don't go too fast and they did a good job of accommodating pedestrians from what I saw.   Room Tip: All rooms are great, don't overthink it. See more room tips",1
"I've stayed in a few 5* Hotels in Mykonos since I first visited the island in the summer of 2000. I love Mykonos so much that I sometimes head over there a couple of times a year. This is the first time that I've experienced a stay like this though.Firstly, the hospitality is truly impeccable. Such lovely, warm hosts. The architecture is really unique and the staff are simply amazing. Too often in the past I've seen the fake interest in the eyes of managers in similar hotels, but here you really feel how genuine the interest in your stay is. From the smallest of details to the biggest, nothing ever seemed to be too much. When I arrived, I had such a sense of relaxation. I was placed in the hands of my hosts and now had nothing to worry about. I felt I could immediately just go about enjoying the holiday and everything would be taken care of. The room was just as it should be, with lovely decoration, unique furniture pieces and a gorgeous view.The pool area was so relaxing, with fantastic music selections, gorgeous cocktails I had never even heard of before, and some other lovely wee surprises each day. The restaurant at night, with the tables overlooking the scenic sunset of Mykonos, and the staff taking care of my every need? Heaven! As for the food, it was the perfect cuisine that I would expect from an island such as Mykonos, and if I had any special food requests, the chef was only too happy to accomodate me.I hadn't planned to, but was even able to take a yoga lesson one day. It was wonderful and the perfect way to start the day.I'm the first to admit that I can be pretty demanding and if I may say so, I'm sometimes not an easy guest, but at Boheme I felt that I had nothing to worry about. I honestly couldn't fault it. It was like a home away from home. There is nowhere else that I would choose to spend my holidays in Mykonos and I cannot wait to return! Give this hotel a try. I'm so glad that I did and I'm sure you'll be glad too!",2
"If ,you seek the perfect relaxation, service and smilling personnel you should book in Bohem hotel. Well decorated, perfectly clean rooms with fabulous view , always smiling personnel , excellent restaurant and relaxing massage treatments. Highly recommented for couples, families and business people !",3
"The staff is so kind and accommodating it's hard to complain, but don't bother with this hotel. Our room overlooks their parking lot and feels like an IKEA room. Nothing special. The design feels like an afterthought. Housekeeping barely cleaned our room and we weren't given fresh toiletries and towels every day. To get the hotel from town you need to walk up and down a hilly narrow busy street with gasoline fumes so strong I went to sleep every night with a headache. The breakfast included in the room rate is below average and is served in the room. It's shocking that this hotel could charge over $700 a night for something that feels like a glorified hostel. Go elsewhere.",3
"Excellent hospitality, tranquility, fun and a certainly must do! Ria Salmata the manager was superb not forgetting Chris 'the party man' who is the driver who gave us excellent recommendations on places to go for dining and partying! Well done to the management",2
"That was my 6th visit to Mykonos in so many years. First time at Boheme. Pick up from airport was excellent and was really surprised to arrive at the hotel in 5 minutes. Hotel is really close to the Mykonos town which is a 5 minutes walk (uphill when back from town though).Who wants to walk after a night out!Very simple and easy check-in. Reception team was great. Rooms are very nicely decorated and spacious. Was upgraded to a ""bigger"" room even though the same category. It was under the pool to a bit noisy especially during morning clean-up of the pool area.We had breakfast in the room on the terrace during our stay (a la carte).Food is not bad at all.My wife had a massage. She highly recommended the physiotherapist.No incidents at la Boheme but at the same time nothing was really special.Will try another hotel if I go back to Mykonos.",2
"A fabulous hotel with impeccable service!! The Rooms are beautifully modern, fresh and stylish with a great attention to details! I loved the little aroma therapy patch under my pillow!! From the lovely team at the reception that will literally do anything they can to help you even with little unexpected fashion emergencies!!(ladies will understand this one..Anna you are are star!!) to the the welcoming waiters all around the hotel.. Another special mention to Theodore who use to bring us our tailored breakfast and set it up beautifully for us every morning in the terrace with the biggest smile ever!! Fantastic location about a 3 min walk to downtown. Thank you Boheme for making our stay in Mykonos unforgettable.. A truly outstanding hotel by all means.",0
"Hotel Boheme was booked for us by our travel agent and we had no knowledge of the place. Fortunately we were very pleasantly surprised by the awesomeness of this place . From the location to the food to the extremely courteous staff this place was total perfection. Our room was a honey moon suite with a perfect view of the sunset at the sea. We also had a hot tub with the same view . The icing on the cake was instead of traditional buffet breakfast , here it is breakfast made to your liking and brought to your room or balcony . Yes we enjoyed breakfast with a spectacular view every morning . The staff was beyond courteous . George and Theodore were really helpful . I don't remember the other names ,but they were very polite and friendly . My son got something in his eye the bell boy ran and got eye drops for him . The food was best available at the island . The location is ideal too. It is just walking distance form the windmills and every thing else. I would highly recommend this place to everyone . Thanks a lot for making our stay so comfortable and memorable .",0
"We spent 5 nights at this gem of a hotel! We had high expectations since it came with a SLH tag and each expectation was met. Starting with the port pickup in a Jeep Wrangler to the complimentary upgrade to the Honeymoon Suite (read: with personal jacuzzi, sunset views, large balcony) everything about Boheme was outstanding.We got a detailed briefing right from the airport pickup to the hotel on the must do's in Mykonos...about the hotel and generally anything we needed to know including how best to spend the 5 nights we had in this lovely island. Each member of the staff is outstanding and very knowledgable and helpful! Within minutes of check in they all know you, which is very personal indeed. Anna and Rhea at the front desk made us feel very welcome and pampered!Each room is assigned a mobile phone with ability to call the reception from anywhere in the island for any assistance that you may require (read: taxis, restaurant reservations etc). No extra charge for this one!The hotel encourages breakfast service in the room although we always went to the restaurant to eat. The sea view and the pool by the side were compelling reasons to eat breakfast outside the room! The breakfast was all a la carte and was delicious! The quality of the food generally was quite good. The hotel is located within minutes of the famous windmills, little Venice and the old town. It's literally a 5-7 minute walk downhill and you are in the thick of things! The beaches are not too far off and all within 10-15 minutes driving distance. Believe it or not there are just 30 taxis in the whole island. But this hotel offers drops and pickups from key locations at the same rates as the taxis subject to availability of the hotel car (which is much better than the taxis...with Chris playing some fantastic music!)The rooms are very contemporary and designed and stocked with modern amenities complete with iPod dock. No tea making facilities although room service brings hot water whenever required. The bathrooms are lovely and stocked with Aqua di Parma toiletries. We would definitely consider staying here again and high recommend this small luxury hotel :)",1
"The most beautiful setting, impeccable service, fantastic food and drinks, and extremely friendly staff and manager made our stay an unforgettable experience. What also made it special was the little treats and snacks that we were given in the room and around the pool- it made us feel at home. We were very sad to leave but will definitely return in the near future!",3
"Boheme is well situated from the town of Mykonos. It is clean and well maintained with a beautiful view of the sea, with a lovely pool. We stayed in the honeymoon suite with a jacuzzi on the terrace. The breakfast was excellent, ample and tasty. But what makes Boheme a marvelous experience is the service provided by the staff for the guests who occupy the mere 20 suites. Ria, Anna, Vicki, Doula, Chris, Aggellos, Yannis, Gregoris, George, Theo, Nikos, Vassily, and Aurella provided gracious and attentive service. They made our 19 nights very special! Ah Mykonos, Ah Boheme. The best hotel on the best island.",1
"We stayed at this beautiful, modern hotel for 5 nights and everything about it was exceptional! The staff (reception, bartenders, drivers) and service are outstanding, quite possibly the best service we have ever had! We had a suite with a rooftop deck with a warm jacuzzi and a spectacular view of the sea. The room itself was bright, spacious and spotless and the bed and pillows were very comfortable (and I am very fussy about pillows). The location was also amazing, being about a 5 minute walk to Mykonos Town, a 5 minute drive to Ornos, and a 15 minute drive to Paraga and Psarou beaches. It was a dream vacation and my husband and I can’t wait to go back next July.",2
"The best room I ever stayed at and I've tried quite a few 5 stars Hotels across the globe due to my job! Spacious, breathtaking view, luxurious combined with simplicity, all the amendments you could possible look for! Simply amazing!!!We didn't want to leave and I guess we weren't the only ones. That's the reason we only felt a bit uncomfortable on our check out since by 12:15 we had two notices and an ""intrusion"" for mini bar check!Hotel's staff without any exception extremely polite and totally professional!!!Although it is highly priced it is a luxury that worths it, if you can afford it!We are definitely coming back one day!",2
"Stayed here with a friend for five nights last weekend. What a great hotel! Everything was exceptional. The reception staff can't do enough for you, the rooms are immaculate and the view is insane. Breakfast on the balcony every morning at a time chosen by guests is the icing on the cake. Another winning hotel from the SLH group.",3
"This is the 4th time in 3 years we stay here. We can just repeat, this hotel is the best place to stay on the island! We love the room, the view, the staff... The service is more than excellent! The hotel is very stylish, a bit minimalistic (which we love!) and you can just feel the people work here with joy and passion! Already booked for another week end of this month!",2
"We write rarely reviews, but in this case we do like!After 7 years we are back for a short stay in Mykonos.On the island has not changed so much - it is still very nice and charming,but there are some renovated and new (small) hotels.We have found the perfect one - the Boheme!The Boheme is a very beautiful and so lovely small boutique hotel.Very close to the Mykonos center (5 minutes to walk) and with an incredible staff - so nice, friendly and helpful!!!!!Open Rezeption, beautiful Pool, nice Rooms........and the breakfast is standard on the room (with an amazing sea view)!It is very familiar and everything was perfect.Thanks for a wonderful stay!We will definitely come back again..........Thomas and Claudi",1
"I reserved Boheme for the first week of June and had such a good experience I wanted to come on here to praise them!PROS: Amazing views, detail oriented staff that wrote a wonderful welcome note and left it on our room, very good breakfast, great location walking distance from the center of everything.CONS: water was lukewarm during the stay, it could have been better, and had an issue getting into our room one night when we lost the key, it took longer than it should have to get help.But I would still rate the hotel a 5 as it hit all my major points.",2
"The Boheme hotel is located very close to Mykonos city, just 5 min walk. Great place to stay, Very friendly staff. wonderful facilities.the pool is excellent. The kitchen/cocktails are the best of Mykonos...Chris, driver, he is very helpful, recommended to move around.",2
"Booked this hotel for a 4 night stay with my partner. Found on hotels.com with significant discount (AUD$530/night, about 50% discount for a Deluxe suite sea view).Location is a 5 min walk out of the hustle and bustle of town Centre. This is great. The walk into town is down a very busy road and a little hill that some people may find a little dangerous. Not a problem in my view.This SLH boutique hotel is perfect for couples or a group of people prepared to splash out a bit.PROS:- Very friendly & helpful staff. Made dinner reservations on our behalf very happily.- Chilled vibe by the pool during the day.- Chic modern room decor.- Great breakfast served on your private balcony.- Acqua di Parma bathroom products.CONS:- Avoid room 28. It is located under the pool bar, there is a constant gentle hum that can be heard at all times (caused by pool filter or something similar).- Limited shaded/covered lounge seating by the pool when the hotel is busy.- Water should be provided for free during the day. Expected at this price in my opinion. A 500ml bottle per person is left in the room in late afternoon. You really need much more as it is quite hot during Summer.The hotel quoted us €30 per person for an airport transfer. We just caught a taxi from the airport for €10 for what is a short 3km trip. Go with this option!",1
"I booked last minute, the location was a plus for us. Its very close to the center where all the shops and restaurants are. Our room had an amazing view of the sea that we were able to have breakfast by. The staff were beyond kind and helpful. They provided us with a cellphone to call if we needed anything while we were in the city. The driver we asked for was also so kind! overall amazing service and staff! Being two interior architects we loved the interior very boheme :)Will definately be returning sometime soon....",4
"We have just enjoyed a very pleasant and comfortable week in this three year old hotel. We had the good fortune to have an upgrade to probably the best room in the place(19) owing to a misplaced conception that we were returning guests! So we got lucky. The situation of the hotel is excellent, just 5/10 minutes walk from the town, and as a result very quiet, with lovely sea views. The rooms are simple in the extreme. Bare walls and floors; not a picture or rug. Very limited hanging space for clothes and not a single shelf or drawer. I think for €500++ per night one deserves some more space to unpack. But the balconies are well supplied with cushions and seating. Service is efficient and very cheerful from hard working staff. The pool area is also nice, but might lack space if well used. Personally I would dispense with the music. If I want music I will provide my own. Isn't that what everyone does these days?. Breakfast is served in your room to order. The pool area doubles as a bar and eating area. Food menu is limited but quite acceptable. Nothing outstanding. Recommended if your wallet can cope!",2
"We loved everything about this hotel - our room, the wonderful pool/bar/restaurant area, the food, the location and most of all - the great people who work there.We stayed in one of the standard rooms and whilst we were a little jealous of the rooms with jacuzzis and larger terraces with loungers, it was nevertheless a lovely room with everything we needed - a large comfortable bed, a good size bathroom, a small balcony and separate terrace with great views over the bay and surrounding area. The room and all other areas of the hotel were always spotlessly clean.Although there are lots of nice places to eat in the town, the food in the hotel's restaurant was so good (in our opinion) that we ended up eating there every night except one. It would also be very hard to beat the restaurant’s outdoor setting, with fantastic sunset views over the bay. Although we would also advise exploring the town at night time.The breakfast is also very good, with a wide selection of items which I’m sure would suit most tastes. You can either have it in the restaurant area or brought to your room at a time of your choice.The location is perfect, only a five-minute walk from the old town and the windmills. It's a bit uphill on the way back, but nothing really to worry about. But the best thing about this hotel is its staff. We've had very good service before, but have never stayed anywhere where every single member of staff has been so genuinely friendly and helpful, but without ever being overbearing. Whilst it doesn’t seem fair to leave anyone out, we'd particularly like to thank Anna for her warm welcome and helpful advice about where to eat/drink/visit etc; Theodore, Gregor, Georgios and Nikos in the restaurant and bar, and Chris from reception. You must try one (or more) of Nikos’ cocktails – made with great attention to detail and the best I’ve ever had!We would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return as soon as possible.",2
"The hotel has just been redone with a lot of taste. Just what you expect when you first come to Mykonos. The service was incredibly nice with lots of nice attention.We had been go en a free portable Phone with the registered number of the hotel in case of needs. Charger for your phones in the room etc....As we were visiting for a wedding,we got up at noon and they kindly brought us our breakfast without charge . As i had put Nutella on My bathroom wardrobe I left a note to apologize to the cleaning lady and i got back a new one with a cute little drawing.A give minutes walk from center which a s good because you don't want to be in the crowd .Nice jakuzzi on our own Terrace at great temperature, ideal after partying to rest and look at the shooting stars   Room Tip: With jakuzzi See more room tips",2
"We recently enjoyed a 5 night stay at this wonderfully designed hotel. The staff were all very approachable and helpful and were genuinely welcoming to the guests. The concierge desk provided useful advice on local attractions and dinner recommendations and we particularly enjoyed our interactions with the staff manning the pool bar/kitchen who were kind, attentive and good fun. The public spaces of the hotel (the lobby and pool area in particular) are stunning with gorgeous views out to sea and simple, attractive design in keeping with the Cycladean style. There was plenty of space to relax and sunbathe and the large pool provided cooling refreshment. Our room (a honeymoon suite) was spotless and beautiful with a perfect sea view, comfortable and large bed, interesting design features, plenty of storage space, well appointed bathroom area, and a lovely deck with Jacuzzi and day-bed. You could choose to have breakfast on your deck or at the pool bar which was a nice touch.The rooms and the public spaces are a calm retreat from the buzz of Mykonos town and after a long day at the beach or wandering through the town it was great to have a quiet place to retreat to in comfort. In short this was just what we wanted - a beautiful place to stay with genuinely kind staff and little touches of luxury throughout that added something special to our stay. Wholeheartedly recommended.   Room Tip: The honeymoon suits provide extra touches of luxury to enhance a stay. All the views are gorgeous. See more room tips",2
"This is a very nice hotel and in a great location within walking distance to the main town. While it is lovely and has been rated so highly, we were curious to check it out but found a few things that were a bit disappointing. First off we had a very large suite but it had the tiniest of bathrooms with absolutely no storage space for toiletries. For three people this becomes a problem. More annoying was the fact that there's literally no furniture for clothing (no drawers or shelves) other than a small closet area by the door so we were essentially living out of our suitcases for 4 nights. Not how you want to travel. In lieu of the large L sofa it would've been nice to have a dresser or armoire. There's an AC but in the main room in order to cool the king bed area you had to freeze out the person on the rollaway. The pool area is beautiful but on our first day we left our chaise for maybe 10 minutes maximum to grab a few things from the room and we come back to find that the pool guy removed all our belongings and gave away or spots to another couple - even after being gone such a short time and leaving behind an ipad, sunscreens, reading materials, hats, etc. He gave us no apology and the most ridiculous story saying he thought we left for the day. I mean seriously, it was a few minutes and we left all our stuff! On a positive note they offer a nice breakfast and the staff was friendly and eager to please. we came across other 5 star properties (particularly those at Psarou) that we might have preferred but there were many nice things about Boheme. I would have given 5 stars if the accommodations were furnished better and if our view didn't overlook an abandoned concrete building.",0
"We stayed here for 3 nights and as hotels go this was amazing. Location is a mere 6 to 7 minutes to mykanos town, and located in a perfect setting for catching the sunset by the pool and restaurant.The restaurant serves a fantastic array of food and cocktails, andeven uses its own herbs and lemons growing in its garden.The hotel is clean, spaces and peaceful with staff on hand throughout to look after you. The staff actually made you feel part of the island and hotel and helpful in all aspects of the hotel.Would highly recommend and certainly be back.Thank you boheme",2
"We stayed in the Bohemian Suite. It was wonderful. Very large and comfortable room with 2 double beds and an outdoor with a private jacuzzi, comfortable lounge furniture and table and chairs where they brought us breakfast every morning. When we checked in, they gave us a phone which we could use to call them wherever we were and they would come and pick us up. But the best part was the staff. Anna, Chris and George were genuinely nice people and provided exceptional service. The hotel itself is about a 5 minute walk to town; I think it was a 5 or 8 euro cab ride. For breakfast, we called the night before and ordered what we wanted and they brought it to our room. Everything was fresh and delicious. I'd most definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.   Room Tip: Stay in the Bohemian Suite! Great view, great room. See more room tips",3
"This hotel was magnificent. Amazing service, gorgeous views, delicious food (breakfast is especially delicious). 5 minute walk from Mykonos Town. Highly recommend for a romantic couple's getaway. I would not stay here with kids as it's a very quiet, intimate hotel.   Room Tip: all rooms have sea-view with balcony See more room tips",2
"The team was amazing , friendly, helpful, polite.Breakfast very nice ! We ate also lunch and it was very tasty . Very clean .Position perfect, very close to the center of the town and bus station - taxi rank for the beaches .I would recommend to go",2
BRILLIANT!! If you're thinking of trying this hotel JUST DO IT!! Found this as an early offer and it looked great. It surpassed all our expectations. Stayed from 5th to 12th May 2016. Weather warm / hot and sunny. Welcome breeze in pool area. All the staff were brilliant - polite friendly and very professional.Even gave us a mobile phone for our stay so we could call the hotel for any problem we might encounter whilst out and about - how thoughtful is that?Best boutique hotel we have stayed in   Room Tip: Lower level rooms have excellent views and are lower down from the road See more room tips,2
"Superb location just a 5 minute walk into town, a 5 minute drive from the airport (not that you'd know), a beautiful setting, lovely room with all the amenities that you need, what else could there be?Well the people who work there for a start, they are amazing !!! I'm not underestimating this either, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you feel part of the Boheme family. Everyone is so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble, from George and Theodore by the pool to Ria, Vicky and Anna on reception (plus those who's names I can't remember - sorry Boheme people). Service in every aspect was impeccable and we are looking forward to going back !Not to mention the ""double upgrade"" that we got - thank you so much Boheme and Pietra E Mare !If you are looking to stay in Myknonos Town, stay here you will not be disappointed !!",2
"Firstly, this hotel is undoubtedly lovely. There were several nice touches on arrival including a glass of fresh lemonade, great service and we were even given a Greek mobile phone which we could use to call the hotel reception for a taxi or any help whenever we were out and about in Mykonos Town. The hotel is in a great location - just 5 minutes walk into Mykonos Town where there are gorgeous bars and shops. The setting around the bar and pool of the hotel is beautiful - perfect view of the sunset and the beds around the pool are ridiculously comfortable.You can order your breakfast to your hotel room and eat it on the balcony which is another great touch. The breakfast menu is extensive however there are a few items which you have to pay extra for (avocado and smoked salmon etc.) which is a shame.Me and my friend visited this hotel in early May and overall had a lovely time. At the end of our stay we were asked to provide some feedback on a form which was left in our room. We did so and noted a few tiny issues. None of these issues were ""deal-breakers"" and would not stop us returning to the hotel, however we thought it would be useful to note them down so that the staff at Boheme could address these and make the service even better for future guests.As we checked out, the hotel Manager unfortunately read out our feedback form in front of 4 other members of staff who were standing behind the front desk. She challenged each point made on the form rather than apologizing or offering any kind of condolence. This was quite frankly mortifying and unfortunately ruined the end of our stay. My friend and I felt uncomfortable, intimidated and also embarrassed. Considering the hotel is noted as a 5* hotel, I would not expect this kind of customer service.",7
"Having booked this hotel 48 hours before flying to Mykonos we were not sure what to expect but were utterly blown away by the beauty of the island & the warmth of the staff. We loved it so much we changed our fights & stayed an extra night -! The views of the sunset from the pool terrace are tough to beat, the food in the restaurant is absolutely excellent, & the people who work here should have their salaries tripled immediately. Thank you, Anna, for making my birthday so special-! We were surprised to see children staying in the room next to us, as the ambience of the hotel does not really lend itself to families. Luckily they were never in their hot tub when we wanted to relax in ours! Mykonos was a fantastic destination, with incredible beaches, shopping & nightlife. Book this hotel immediately - you won't regret it.   Room Tip: Avoid the rooms immediately below the kitchen area- they are LOUD See more room tips",2
"My friend and I visited Greece last week and had the most amazing and relaxing time! Of all the places we stayed in, Boheme was by far our favorite. The staff was so welcoming and helpful; they were warm & friendly yet made us feel like we were special guests. Since the hotel is fairly small with only about 30-40 rooms, the service felt personalized. The room was very clean and beautiful, kind of looks like a West Elm inspiration. (Wish I had taken pictures of the room but the photos on trip advisor are accurate depictions). We had a private jacuzzi and hang out area on the balcony where we relaxed and watched the sunset. The vibe of the hotel is more relaxing so there is chill music playing in the background and is peaceful. Mostly couples which made it feel a little awkward at first but everyone was so friendly that we quickly forgot and just enjoyed our time. It was such a nice getaway from hectic life in NYC to be somewhere relaxing. The great thing is that it was only a 5 minute walk into Mykonos town where it's more vibrant with locals and tourists, restaurants, shops and bars but can easily head back to Boheme for the relaxation we were looking for. The staff had some great suggestions for places to eat and visit, they are all so friendly!! Anna was our main contact, who welcomed and helped us get checked in. We were welcomed with some fresh homemade lemonade from their lemon tree (nice touch). She gave us a tour of the property and handed us a mobile phone we can use to contact the hotel if we got lost (which wasn't an issue) or had any questions/needs while we were out and about. If we needed any room service, they were always on top of it. Breakfast was included in the room rate and had some delicious choices. We placed our breakfast order when we returned from outings in the evening and they were able to gladly accommodate.Can't wait to go back to Mykonos and visit Boheme again. Thanks to the staff for such an awesome experience!",2
We stayed here at the end of April for 5 nights. This hotel is absolutely stunning and we can highly recommend it. The attention to detail is superb. We were made to feel extremely welcome from the moment we arrived and nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly and efficient team led by Ria the Manager. We were lucky enough to be given a free upgrade to the most stunning room with the best toiletries - Acqua di Parma ! We can honestly say the beds were the most comfortable we have ever had. The hotel is very well located just outside the hustle and bustle of Mykonos Town but within a 10 minute walk. It has fantastic views from the rooms and the public areas. The breakfast was excellent and could be taken either on your balcony or in the restaurant. We also had lunches most days and could not fault anything. Everything about this hotel makes you just relax and we will definitely return. Thank you.,3
"What a fantastic stay. We’ve just returned from a week at the Boheme and we really couldn’t fault it. We were met at the airport by a private transfer following a very early flight which was lovely and the moment you walk in, you feel at peace. The decor is simple, understated and very stylish. The pale concrete finish of the seats and floors perfectly complement the white walls and brightly coloured soft furnishings in the public pool area and the view is great overlooking the water and Delos – a perfect spot to sip a cocktail watching the sun go down. We took a seat in the reception area and were given a complimentary homemade lemonade which was lovely and refreshing. After completing our registration we were shown the public areas of the hotel and we then decided to get changed and sit by the pool as our room wasn’t quite ready. After only about half an hour and a cup of tea drunk whilst we lounged on the lovely big bean bags gazing at the sea, we were shown to our room. Again the decor was lovely and simple, very tasteful and exceptionally clean. The room also had a small balcony overlooking the water which was lovely to eat your breakfast at or watch the sunset. The bathroom was great and we also had a smart TV that enabled us to log into our Netflix account one night and watch tv when the weather wasn’t too good. Each morning you can have breakfast in your room which is really nice. You order what you want from the menu the night before and it’s brought to you at a time you choose. You then call reception to get it taken away again when you’re done. We usually waited until we’d gone to the pool or went out which was also fine. The hotel is situated about a ten minute walk from the centre of Mykonos Town up so it’s easy to walk down the hill to find something to eat in the evening or go to any of the local bars. Take care on the road as the cars and bikes do tend to whiz by quite quickly. We spent the first three days lounging around the pool each day as it was lovely and quiet with attentive service. The pool is lovely but was chilly as it’s not heated but in the heat, is actually lovely and refreshing and not too excruciating once you’re in! We then usually ventured into town for our evening meal.During the week, I used the massage service which has its own little dedicated area in the small garden. The experience was great and left me feeling sleepy and relaxed but was over all too quickly! We also ate at the hotel one evening and although we were the only people there, the setting and ambience was perfect.I can’t rate this hotel highly enough. The staff were all exceptional and really help to make your stay outstanding – nothing is too much trouble. We have been to Mykonos three times for a week over the last 15 years and the Boheme is now one of my favourite hotels in the world. We will without doubt stay here again when we return.",2
"Gorgeous boutique hotel with a beautiful sea view, minimalistic and chic rooms, and excellent service. Room was spacious and had a terrace which was perfect for sunset. Didn't have an issue with noise, but it's not high season yet. The moment we arrived we were already greeted with warm smiles and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They were helpful in everything from booking excursions, recommending good local restaurants, to finding us a photo shop in town when I needed a new SD card. They also remembered where we went everyday, which made us feel at home. It's a short 5 minute walk to town, which we appreciated as it left our schedule more flexible and we didn't need to book taxis for dinner. Breakfast was great, with a wide range of fresh, made-to-order options. Again, wonderful service from the waiters. Highly recommend this hotel, which is worthy of the SLH accreditation. Thank you especially to Anna, Vicky, Hamad and Chris for making our stay so comfortable!",1
"We stayed during one week. The room was really comfy and the jacuzzi on the terrace was amazing, with seaview !! Every morning the breakfast was served in room... The team super kind !! I recommend this hotel in Mykonos !!!",1
"From before our arrival, throughout the entire stay and even after the return home, we were struck by the Boheme's quality and magical sense of service.We had the chance to experience the hotel exclusively (with no other guests) for one afternoon - it was the first day of the season - and have to say that even when other guests had arrived the permanent feeling of comfort was very welcome.We were especially struck by the availability and professionalism of all staff members. A small example was the patient ""aftersales"" service provided by Doula, who undertook all efforts to have some of our clothes sent to our home via courrier after we had left - we probably forgot them because we wanted to stay-.We can only advice others to try this place, but for us it was simply ""magic"".Many thanks to all staff and see you soon!

"We wanted a week away before the kids stop school and the summer madness starts... However this small boutique hotel has the most relaxing feel that I don't think it matters what month you go. We arranged for a private transfer from airport to hotel, Chris picked us up and welcomed us to Mykonos, we jumped into his jeep with 2 bottles of chilled water waiting, we needed them and such little detail impressed us. (simple things) and it was only a short drive to Boheme. Arriving at hotel we were greeted by the lovely Anna, she handed us 2 glasses of homemade lemonade, picked from the trees in the garden. We were then given a tour of the pool/bar/garden area were she explained everything we need to know. She then handed us a mobile phone so we don't get lost, or if we need anything we can call reception anytime, another little detail that came in handy.The room is very chic and instantly you can tell your on an island, sun- bleached wood and distressed paintwork. Natural colours, textures and stone, plumped scatter cushions perfectly scattered, quirky mis-matched light fittings that fit, art books carefully placed on surfaces, a spacious comfortable balcony and the view! It's cleaned daily with fresh towels/toiletries and bottled water left on your bedside table. The pool area is exactly what it should be, comfortable and relaxing, sinkable bean bags, cosy Bali beds and a cushioned shaded area to escape to, no uncomfortable sun loungers here! The polite, friendly and well mannered pool/bar staff, Theo Hamed and George looked after us, they were always there but never intrusive and if you needed anything they magically just knew! Nothing was too much trouble for them and they could not do enough for you.The breakfast is delicious with a wide variety of choice, it can be ordered the night before or you can call in the morning and the wait is around 20 minutes as everything is cooked freshly to order, it's then delivered to your balcony - the best way to start the day! We also had lunch most days and the food there is better than most restaurants in Mykonos town! We wanted to hire a car as we were recommended to go to Agios Sostis beach, it was done for us, no hassle at all, and a beach bag filled with towels and water was waiting for us when we left. (The beach 15 min drive away is a must visit place and kiki's taverna too.) The location is perfect, Mykonos town itself is charming, cobbled laned streets filled with shops bars and restaurants, its only 5 min walk away - which you really appreciate as there is only 30 taxis on the island. We have had the most relaxing and wonderful experience at this hotel, the attention to detail is impeccable and the staff are all so friendly and helpful. Thank you everyone! Special thank you to Ria the hotel manager who clearly does an amazing job, Anna, Doula, Theo and Chris for looking after us so well. We look forward to seeing you all next year. Cheryl & Liam",0
"Everything about the Boheme really is perfect. Every little detail has been thought of and the team are the friendliest and most helpful I have ever met, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfasts on the balcony were fantastic and the a la carte food was delicious too. Our room (22) was a haven of relaxed chic, the furniture was more like art and the view from the balcony was to die for.It is only a short walk into Mykonos town and although we ate in town most nights, the food at the Boheme was far better than any restaurants in town. We also got a mobile phone for the week pre-programmed with the reception number just in case we got lost in town (everyone does), or basically if we needed anything at all.Whilst we were there it was my 50th birthday and I was given a lovely handwritten note, bottle of wine and a scrumptious fruit platter, a really special touch.Thank you (apologies for the English spelling) George, Hamed, Chris, Theodore, the amazing girls on reception...... all of you are brilliant, we can't wait to come back.   Room Tip: We had room 22, a deluxe suite, it was fantastic. See more room tips",2
"Stayed here for 3 nights and it was a great experience. The hotel itself is situated in a great location to enjoy the sunset and view, and close enough to walk into the main town. It also has great decor and rooms.The staff was very welcoming and friendly. The manager was great! We had an issue with a cab called for us (it was more expensive than we thought) - so she arranged for our ride to the port for free and made our stay more comfortable!The breakfast each morning was great as well.Will definitely stay here when we come back to Mykonos!",1
"The reviews and photos of Boheme honestly don't do it justice. It was perfect in every respect - the staff were out of this world - genuinely friendly and interested in making sure you had the best stay ever. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome - ice cold homemade lemonade in the prettiest reception overlooking the bay followed by a tour from Ria the manager who was charming, whilst Chris grabbed the bags from the hire car. Thodoris, Hamed and Gregoris were always on form at the bar and Chris the chef rustled up the best breakfasts I have had - absolutely delicious each and every morning with a huge variety to choose from - naughty and healthy - the Greek omelette was so delicious as was the French toast with cinnamon sugar. And you don't have to leap up at 8am to get breakfast - it is delivered to your balcony every day (no extra charge) right up until 11am. The rooms are wonderful with the most amazing balconies and views of the sunsets (some balconies have hot tubs too!). The decor is really cool and quirky - I was sorely tempted to steal all the cushions and light fittings! The pool area and restaurant is soooo relaxed we had to drag ourselves to the many beaches (all great recommendations from the guys) because it would be so easy to stay on one of the many beds - doubles, beanbags or cushioned shaded areas. Nicos and Christos made a mean cocktail and the ice cold beers were fab - all served with nibbles and a friendly chat. The sunsets in the evening were absolutely stunning and different every night and it was so lovely to see all the guys enjoying them too even though they see them every day. We had a ritual every evening of a cocktail at sunset and then a walk into town for supper. Mykonos Town is a only a 5 minute walk down the hill and again the lovely staff offered ideas on where to eat and what to see (thank you Hamed, Vicky, Anna and Arxondola!) - we didn't go wrong once. A non-hotel related tip (but recommended by the staff) – don't miss Delos - amazing archaeological site 20 mins away by ferry from the old port. Boheme has the most wonderful atmosphere – the care that has been taken in the design (feels like a beautiful home) and in choosing such lovely staff shines through - we honestly could not recommend it highly enough. We would definitely return in a heartbeat. Thank you everyone at Boheme",1
"Great stay. Staff very attentive and helpful. Room service was great. Located only 5-10 mins from town. Rooms very nice and clean. Only prob was a noise from the bar that woke us at around 07:30 each morning in room 27. Staff said if we told them earlier they would have moved us. Anyway, great overall",1
"We stayed for 3 nights from the 30th April and met up with friends who had arrived the day before.Excellent service from the time we made our booking and during our whole stay-Such a lovely welcome from everyone when we arrived,all so friendly and helpful!Delightful breakfast on our balcony daily or by the pool- you can do either,whichever you prefer.Attentive service at the pool area and bar throughout the day,getting towels and sun beds ready as soon as you arrived,checking if we wanted any more drinks or food,nothing was too much trouble and all with a cheerful smile! The hotel is ideally located and tastefully decorated . Very airy rooms with exceedingly comfy beds.Very easy to walk into town if you wish as only 10 minutes or the hotel will call you a taxi if you want to go elsewhere.We were given some great suggestions for restaurants for the evenings ,although if you prefer you can eat at the lovely bar area.Would recommend this hotel to anyone ,it was a wonderful relaxing break and we look forward to returning on our next Greek island tour!Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made us all so welcome.   Room Tip: All sea views See more room tips",2
5star Greek hotels in my experience can be a bit of a variable feast. Fear not prospective guests - this is one of the best! It is situated just over a 5minute walk from Mykonos town down a steepish hill with no pavement and a lot of traffic much of which is driven by tourists unfamiliar with their vehicles and Greek roads Take extra care - major trauma results in a trip to Athens. A taxi costs 5euros to get back. Without exception all the staff are incredible. You eat by the pool terrace or have breakfast in your room.The food is good - Iwould have liked to have a Greek plat du jour added to the menu. Do not bring many clothes here as room storage space is ridiculously limited.,1
"This is an impeccable hotel and the staff are very attentive and friendly. There were some lovely small touches like a mobile phone if you need to help with anything while you are away from the hotel, and they gave us candles to celebrate Greek Easter. Rooms and hotel grounds are very clean, well decorated and comfortable with superb sea views to enjoy. Our room had a hot tub which was a lovely extra and well used on the one cool wet day we experienced! We had a fantastic breakfast served on our terrace every morning. Its a short walk into the beautiful town centre and although its a walk up the hill back, we didn't find it a problem. Our only minor criticism was the outdoor pool which was unheated and far too cold to enjoy. But overall, we could not fault this hotel or the island and its lovely people and cant wait for our return visit very soon!",1
"Great welcome, staff really kind and helpful, location just out of the hussle and bussle of Mykonos town and yet with gorgeous views. I liked the small details (mobile to keep in touch anytime, beach towel to take out, breakfast a la carte in your room, etc.).",0
"Very clean, nicely located, excellent view, extremely friendly staff, marvellous swimming pool area, high quality breakfast, modern and minimalistic decoration. Keep up the very good work and great quality services in this wonderful hotel!",1
"Turning 40 is quite daunting, however my week celebration at this hotel was the best experience everAll the staff are exceptional, they made every element of my holiday feel so relaxed and I felt totally special - like a queen! From the beginning, Etihad airways lost my luggage and the front desk staff selflessly worked 24 hours to ensure my bag arrive to the hotel. During my whole stay the staff really spoiled me from their scrumptious breakfast room delivery to hosting my guests that came to visit me at the hotel. There were two Mo's that serviced the room daily - they were the best hotel employees. Not to mention how they showered me with attention on my actual birthday. They surprised me with a free 1 hour massage as my birthday gift. The service that I loved the most was the use of their mobile phone. They provide you with a mobile phone to use anywhere on the island. I would call the front desk reception to arrange for a pick up and drop off and they would pick me up any where from the island within a 30 minute time frame . This made my entire trip stress free. You can drink and not worry about transportation.I felt totally safe and loved during my stayI will definitely return to this hotel",1
"Dear God, I'm overwhelmed by my experience at BOHEME. Impeccable service, fantastic room.All my needs were met and exceeded. I've never been so much at peace during a vacation.Manager and front desk staff to be applauded for great communication.",2
"My husband and I chose to stay at Boheme after reading wonderful reviews and seeing the many beautiful pictures. We cannot sing their praises enough! The hotel is very close to Mykonos Town, only about a 5 - 7 minute walk. It was worth staying a little ways out of the town because of the gorgeous sunset views all Boheme rooms have to offer! Due to the timing of our flight into Mykonos, we arrived quite early but the staff hurried to have our room ready as quickly as possible. The entire staff was extremely friendly and always ready to give us a list of recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing. Anna was particularly helpful and is such a sweetheart! She definitely knows the town well and gave us amazing recommendations. They will arrange for reservations at any restaurant you wish. They also made our arrangements for renting an ATV for the day to tour other parts of the island (highly recommended!). Every morning we had an extensive breakfast menu to choose from - all included in the price of the room. The extremely friendly staff delivered and set up breakfast for us on our terrace each morning at the time of our choosing. The food was delicious and very fresh! I will be craving the Greek omelette and fresh pastries for a long time to come! They also have their own lemon trees in the garden which they make fresh lemonade from. We were greeted with a glass upon arrival, and It is unlike any lemonade I have had! We stayed in room 22 and the private terrace every evening was ideal for watching the beautiful sunset while enjoying a glass of wine. They also have a restaurant located by the pool which is a great spot to watch the sunset and enjoy a cocktail before dinner. We wouldn't change a thing about our visit and hope to be back someday! Thank you to everyone at Boheme for making our honeymoon so enjoyable!",3
"From the minute our shuttle pulled up the service was impeccable. We were greeted on the street to help carry our bags into the hotel and promptly given glasses of fresh squeezed lemonade while we checked in. Our room wasn't ready yet, so we changed into our swimsuits, they assisted us with renting a four-wheeler, and we rode off to explore Mykonos. When we came back, we walked into our room to find a jar of cherries and a beautiful note wishing us a happy marriage (it was our honeymoon) and a bottle of water. The view from our balcony was gorgeous, their breakfast is delicious and the beds are super comfy. The bathrooms are very modern, as is the whole look of the room and the property. A lot of exposed concrete in an urban way. I absolutely loved it and would go back in an instant! Our room was at the top of the hotel, which means that we were at street level, since the hotel is built into the side of the hill, and I never had a problem with hearing the traffic. It actually made it really convenient to just walk out the door and walk down to Old Town.   Room Tip: The higher floors are at street level, but that didn't bother me. I liked having the higher vant... See more room tips",1
Staying here for 6 nights in April and we can already give an excellent review. With only 20 Suites you get very personal attention and good service from the lovely staff. Whole hotel is very smart with lovely swimming pool and wonderful views. Close to town with a short uphill walk back to the hotel but taxis at the bottom of the hill if you really need them (which we didn't).,1
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel, from the beautiful relaxing decor, to the excellent service, this is definitely one of the best places that we have ever stayed in. The staff are excellent and very helpful, and go above and beyond to make you feel welcome, breakfast is included and hand delivered to your room in the morning so that you can eat in the privacy of your own balcony over looking the sea. One of the highlights was watching the sunset from the pool bar while sipping on a nice glass of bubbly. We did go off season in April so it was nice and quiet, and we felt like we had the place to ourselves, we were also upgraded to a bigger room without even asking and I love the fact that they give you a mobile phone to take out with you so that you can call them at anytime if you need anything. It is also only a 5 min walk into town and only a 5 min taxi ride from the airport (8 euro) We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Mykonos.",2
"I cannot recommend this hotel enough . i would come back to mykonos in a heartbeat just to stay here. The staff were AMAZING every hour of the day,all such beautiful people. The views are breathtaking and the hotel itself is STUNNING i had the most romantic time with my partner and had a crazy time with my friends! Thank you so much to all the staff, see you again soon boheme",2
"The room is fashioned mostly of polished concrete, very comfortable. Beautiful views. Terrific staff, very accommodating, very helpful/knowledgeable making various arrangements. Good food, great bar. Very nice pool area. Good location, short walk to town and harbor.",3
"Stunning hotel, staff fabulous. We were lucky to be upgraded to a honeymoon suite which was fab. Loved lazing round the pool and the food was marvellous. A short walk down the hill brings you into town where there are some fab bars and restaurants.   Room Tip: Think they are all nice See more room tips",3
"From the moment we arrived until our parting goodbyes, the staff and service at Hotel Boheme were exceptional. Our room was bright, comfortable, perfectly appointed, and the view was beautiful. The restaurant, bar, and pool area is inviting and perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, sunbathing, reading and just plain enjoying any moment of the day. We loved Hotel Boheme and we can not say enough about the amazingly gracious and helpful staff.",2
"We stayed at Boheme mid October and we were absolutely delighted with everything about our stay. First to mention is the service - from the moment you arrive, to the moment the staff wave you goodbye, the service was impeccable. Never intrusive but always there - just what you want for a relaxing holiday. A special thanks to Mohamed and Leo for the service and to Chris for the one-off cocktails - you really made our holiday special. Food was great, especially breakfast served to your private terraced everyday - a real treat! Lovely to have an outdoor hot tub to watch the sunset every evening too.The rooms are minimalist but extremely comfortable and clean. The pool area is a place to seek total chill-out. The location is excellent, just a short walk every evening to enjoy the delights of Mykonos town.We are both very well travelled but our stay at Boheme was exceptional. Again, a big thank you to all the Boheme staff for making a holiday for us to remember and one that we will definitely want to repoeat.   Room Tip: All rooms have sunset views but I would recommend upgrading to outdoor hot tub See more room tips",4
"This is the only place we will stay in Mykonos. We stayed back in late May, 2015. We were whisked away from the airport and soon sat at the outside desk with glasses of lemonade made from the lemons grown on site! We were unexpectedly upgraded to the Honeymoon suite which gave us a private terrace and jacuzzi tub. The breakfast served in the mornings was delicious and the service from the staff was top notch! Everyone was so friendly. One day was spent lounging around the pool which also had great views. Thank you for giving us such a wonderful experience!",5
"We were on our honeymoon after getting married a few weeks before. It was to be our first return to Mykonos after meeting there 22 years ago. We chose the honeymoon suite at Boheme as best meeting our requirements of a small, luxury hotel with quiet surroundings and a private jacuzzi. The privacy of our honeymoon suite was not good. We had 3 other rooms looking directly onto our balcony and the room next door's jacuzzi was adjacent to ours, separated only by an open topped wall. For the last 2 days of our stay, there were disruptive guests in the room next door. They were playing loud music, shouting across the hotel complex, swearing loudly, having sex on their open balcony within meters of our jacuzzi and even entered our balcony and dropped a beer bottle and cigarette butts in our jacuzzi/balcony. The hotel staff/management were dismissive of our complaint and unable to resolve this over the 2 days. Their only offer of a solution was to move us to an inferior room. Even after later complaining to the general manager, they did not consider the other guests behaviour to be unacceptable. This is apparently their standard procedure for handling disruptive guests. This spoilt our honeymoon, so would not recommend if you are hoping for a quiet, romantic honeymoon/getaway.",12
"Stayed at The Boheme during a one week getaway in Mykonos and was greeted with a beautiful place with very friendly staff. Everyone was very accommodating and met all of our requests without a worry. We had a private terrace overlooking a traditional greek garden with views of the sea. The bathroom and bedroom designs were modern and clean and the double shower was standout. The massive buffet breakfast which they laid on complimentary was incredible and the service from all staff was too good to be true. Needless to say, this is exactly where we will be staying next time we're in Mykonos.",2
From the moment my mother and I arrived we felt very welcome (with delicous lemonade from lemons that were grown in the gardens of the hotel). We had a very friendly and quick tour of the resort and was greeted with a smile from the staff. There was also a lovely little welcoming note with some treats in our room upon our entry. The restaurant and pool area was relaxing with big cushions layed out. Overall I believe the service of the staff at this hotel was exceptional and would highly recommend anyone to stay here. Hotel is a 5 minute walk from the town centre.,3
"This is one great hotel. Our experience there was outstanding. the location and the facility are excellent. The staff can't do enough to make your stay memorable. They are all friendly, efficient and hard working. The rooms are simple but beautiful and well appointed. We would go back there in a heartbeat. If you are planning a trip to Mykonos, this is the place. Don't miss it.   Room Tip: Ask for a sea view room. See more room tips",6
"My Husband and I stayed for a 5 day break mid September. It all went well from the moment we arrived. We received some welcome drinks and as I room wasn't ready we were walked through the places to eat and drink on the island. 30 mins later our room was ready to our sheer delight we were upgraded to the Boheme Suite what a treat..!! The room was simply stunning and stylish in design. 1 very tiny criticism is that there very little storage but that is in keeping with the hotels design. Hotel is in a fabulous location a 5 minute walk down hill to the town. Be warned it can be a pretty hairy walk up and down so keep your wits about you. Staff were amazing extremely friendly and helpful. Loads of advise on places to eat and were able to books tables at their suggestions.. All suggestions were spot on. Another big tick was the mobile phone service which enabled us to call the hotel to send us a car to be picked up from the beach so we were able to get about without the need of a car or quad. I was pregnant so we opted for taxis to get around but they are expensive £££. The breakfast service to your terrace was a nice touch.We ate lunch at the hotel twice food was amazing we opted to eat out of an evening so didn't get a chance to try dinner. hotel was quiet of a day with a handful of bean bags and cabanas we always found a spot if needed, but most guests much like us tended to hit the beaches. Similar of an evening you are 5 mins away from the town so most guests dine out. I looked at a lot of hotels before booking this but was so glad I choose Boheme.. Would recommend to those looking for a nice friendly base for Mykonos Town. Would definitely go back...",6
A friend and I visited the island of Mykonos in May and stayed at the Boheme. From the minute they picked us up at the airport we were in heaven! The staff is absolutely the best I have ever had! They made you feel like family and took care of our every need. The bar and restaurant were superb and the guys were so knowledgeable and attentive. If you are lucky enough to be going to Mykonos you will not be sorry to stay here!,6
"What a great place to stay... They really take good care of you! At Boheme hotel they are soooooo great. They pay attention to every little detail. It was a ""no-worry"" hotel. They serve breakfast in your room. Location is great. Friendly staff. Amazing view of the sunset.",6
"good place , all detail in the right place, good service for breakfast till 11. o'clock ,they make up the room twice a day . i think they have only 20 rooms all with balcony we were at the n. 25. we had an upgrading from the room that we choose originally , was good ,maybe if i want to be perfectionist , a little less privacy respect others but was perfect, clean and good quality towels , nice bed ,wifi free in all the areas public and private.the concierge service was efficent . hotel located near the center .we requested to rent a small car who was delivered to the hotel at the time we asked for .from the main beach it takes more or less 10/20 minutes not more.the airport 5 minutes.   Room Tip: those in the uppper side of the hotel for the view ,for the qiets area those in the bottom 25/26 ect... See more room tips",5
"This hotel is wonderful and I cannot write enough good things about it! This was my second time at the hotel (7th time to Mykonos) and I am already planning my third visit next year. The rooms are beautifully furnished, stylish but comfortable, very clean and fresh. The views from the terrace is lovely and a great place to watch the sunset. The service was out of this world from beginning to end, with incredibly friendly staff who are, in my opinion, awesome! The attention to detail is incredible. The location of the hotel is a short walk to Mykonos Town which is perfect. The pool and poolside bar are a great place to relax. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting Mykonos and I can't wait to go back next year.",7
Cannot fault this beautiful hotel. The staff and the ambiance are wonderful . Everyone here makes you feel special and they really know about service . We will definitely be back . I hope though it remains a great little secret ! Ideal base for seeing some great beaches and only walking distance to Mykonos Town which is a must do destination . Loads at bars and restaurants to close from to suit all tastes and budgets .,6
"We returned from our stay at the Boheme last Friday and are still talking about the beautiful premises and the fabulous views over the bay; not to mention the great service and attentiveness of the staff.This was the holiday that was to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and a belated celebration of my husband's 70th birthday. It did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived we received a warm welcome and a very refreshing glass of homemade lemonade - it was delicious! This was much needed as we had been travelling since 11.30pm the previous night. This was all conducted in the pretty area of the outdoor reception. We were given a tour of all facilities, from the beautiful pool and surrounding areas to the bar and restaurant. Next we discovered they had upgraded our room in honour of our WA! Lovely room with sea view and attractive terrace. This room contains all the extras you need for your holiday - slippers, bathrobes, (this one is my favourite - a hairdryer that isn't attached to the bathroom wall and can be used somewhere more convenient- yess), small fridge, bottle of water with jar of cherry compote. Shower creams etc. in a subtle fragrance. Lovely towels too. There is also the option of beach towels and pool towels - in our experience this is unusual.The bed was extremely comfortable and not the usual arrangement with double beds where they put 2 single beds together. It was one whole bed and very wide. Excellent!Breakfast was served on our terrace at a time of our choosing and was delicious. So much choice - we had continental breakfast as a base and added extras such as scrambled eggs, omelette and so on. (I can recommend the scrambled eggs - best ever!) We also had lunch on 2 days at the hotel and this was also delicious. They also serve some excellent Greek wines. For our anniversary we were made to feel special and were treated to a bottle of superb wine accompanied by savoury snacks and a fruit salad- this was after we had been out in the town and was served late into the night. Thank you 'Boheme', it was lovely.There is an excellent choice of food served at all hours of the day, they even have a night menu for 11pm - 7am.As other reviewers have mentioned, we were given a hotel mobile in case of problems. This was really helpful and gave us peace of mind.The staff are really attentive and there seems to be a genuine ethos of wanting to make sure your stay is as good as it can be. The waiters care for your needs at the pool area. For example, as soon as you enter the pool area, one of them comes forward with a towel for you to lie on, on one of the sunbeds. They are there for you in a very subtle way and at no point is it intrusive.All in all this is a splendid hotel. They will make a restaurant reservation, get you a local bus timetable; anything you need just ask.If we do go back to Mykonos we will definitely stay here; I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.Just a note about Mykonos. Although we belong to the older age group, we did not feel out of place. I had heard it was a party island for younger people but I think that is mainly in July/August. The town is lovely, people friendly with loads of places to eat and escape the outside world. I can recommend it as a holiday destination, whatever your age, although I don't think I would take very young children.Just one negative and that is the walk into town from the hotel. There is no pavement and the road is very busy. It takes about 10mins to walk to town and 15 back (uphill). The authorities ought to provide safer access. It still wouldn't put us off going again though!The service there is second to none, go there, you won't be disappointed.",6
"we have just returned from the Boheme on saturday 19th after having seven fantastic days at the Boheme, from the minute we arrived the staff made us feel so special, we were also upgraded to the Bohamian suite with its owns hottub which was out of this world, the Hotel is so special with amazing views and superb staff who will do everything they can to make your holiday so special, we will return to this hotel without any hesitation and will recommend this special hotel to all are friends, also a thank you to Theo and Mohammed who did all they could to make this holiday fab, see you all next year.   Room Tip: all rooms are fab See more room tips",3
"A great hotel in a good location close to the town. Excellent service from all the staff and a well appointed room with a view over the bay and the magnificent sunsets.The food was good, but should have been better for a hotel of this class.",2
"We were only able to spend two days (one night) at La Boheme, but it was enough to blow our expectations completely out of the water. We got up to the hotel (take a cab just up the hill from where the ferry arrives) around 11 or 12. Check-in wasn't for a few hours, but the staff welcomed us warmly and provided us with freshly squeezed glasses of homemade lemonade. After a small debacle in the check-in area (some gent was infuriated his suite was ""small"" and went off yelling and cussing like a lunatic), we were formally welcomed by the manager. Her voice sounded as I imagine a sultry Greek goddess' would--I still impersonate her sometimes. She gave us a private tour of the grounds and facilities. From the pool, to the restaurant and bar below, over to the massage canopy and the small herb garden (which you can pick and give to the bartender for a cocktail with extra whimsy). Next, she took us to our room, which was a (not THE) honeymoon suite. Inside the outside gate to the room, there is a small hot tub, without the hot. It's the perfect temperature to relax in for hours, if you don't mind raisin fingers. Here's where I really started to notice how thoughtful the amenities were. Along with all the standards, you also get flip flops, slippers, robes, welcome jars of homemade cherry compote, and a cell phone. The cell phone was the kicker for me. We wanted to go out and explore the island, but didn't have a great idea of where we wanted to go, nor where the best places were. All we needed to do was press ""send"" twice and we'd be put through to the front desk, for help with anything we could need.A complimentary continental breakfast *spread* was brought up to our room the next morning, and we also had a 4-wheeler delivered right to the hotel.The service was impeccable--the kind of service that JUST when you think of something you need, a staff member is already walking across the pool deck towards you with water, an ashtray, a stool, an extra towel, what-have-you. Also, the views and phenomenal. I mean, it is a Greek island after all. If you're accustomed for first-class treatment, or want to know what it's like, La Boheme Mykonos will treat you right.",2
"Immediately upon arrival we noticed the great customer service. As we were stepping out of our taxi two people from the hotel were already there to greet us. What really stuck out for me was the way each individual person introduced themselves and shook your hand. It was such a warm welcome we were so excited to be there. We were asked to sit in a lovely seating area while they gathered our bags and check in paperwork. They gave us some delicious homemade lemonade, made with lemons grown on site. When they walked us to our room we were given the pleasant surprise of a complimentary room upgrade! A private terrace with a soaking pool, overlooking the water and sunset. It was bliss. The hotel on a a whole was just spectacular. The staff was helpful in every way imaginable. They gave great suggestions for night life. We had a delicious lunch with wonderful cocktails. Room service was a breeze and always pleasant. The reception staff helped us to arrange and ATV for the day and booked our ferry tickets when the time came to head on to the next stop. My one negative comment would be that there is a bit of noise from the road....this is because everyone drives scooters or ATVs around town....this is part of Mykonos and not something that the hotel can really change. It did not effect our sleeping at all. The bed was great!",5
We stayed here in September this a a wonderfully relaxing place. The service is so friendly the staff can't do enough for you. It is situated within walking distance of Mykonos town.and beaches. The views from the hotel are outstanding. The lovely rooms are so comfortable with balconies overlooking the sea. The pool area is well designed to ensure maximum comfort. I can't recommend this highly enough.   Room Tip: Go for a suite on the South side. See more room tips,4
"Had a three night stay at this hotel and had a very enjoyable stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is quite small but never felt too busy, the immediate surroundings were very quiet and peaceful despite being so close to the airport and town - only a five minute walk away. Only disappointment was there's no immediate access to a beach, but beautiful views all the same!",4
"My partner, Mother, brother and I stayed at Bill & Coo for 10 nights from the 27th June onwards. I can already tell you that this box will not be big enough to write how incredible our experience was here. The staff are what makes this hotel so incredibly unique and special, yes the interior, views, food and everything else is spectacular but I would simply return here just for the staff. As soon as you are picked up from the aiport you know you are in good hands, as soon as we arrived we were taken outside to check in given beautiful food and drinks. We stayed in one of the suites which was beautifully decorated, the a/c is somehow always at the perfect temperature and more Motlen Brown toiletries you could shake a stick at. The breakfast is absolutely divine, something I have never experienced so much before, it is unbelievable that this is all included in the cost. The breakfast team are seriously special, they all work tirelessly to make sure you are happy and fed well, offering us traditional dishes to try with wonderful reccomendations. If you want something thats not on the 5 page breakfast menu they will happily fix you up anything. The pool and views are wonderful and there is always a sunbed for you, mid morning the staff brought us fresh platters of fruit, ice smoothies, hats and facial mist to help us cool down. We didnt have dinner in the evenings but had lunch most days and the food is absolutely incredible, great wine selections (my favourite Domaine OTT and Whipsering Angel were readily available, we used the car service every day and again excellent service - this hotel wouldnt be so successful if it wasnt for its incredible staff - from the drivers, chefs, cleaners and front of house I have never experienced anything like it.We will definately be returning and thank you for an unforgettable experience!!",1
"I really cannot say enough about our week here. Was perfection. We had a huge room with private outdoor hot tub overlooking the sea. The pool area is beautiful, we had no problem at all securing chaises, contrary to other reviewers. The service is the best we have ever had. This is only a 30 room hotel. By day 2, every one knew our names, our drink preferences, etc. Staff was hugely helpful in making reservations for lunch at the beach clubs and also for dinner. It is a manageable walk to town, a huge plus on this island. This was our second trip to Mykonos in two years and we will be back again. Would not stay anywhere else.",0
"Great chef -Athinagoras- great location, magic view! It's not strange that this restaurant earns a reward every year! You enjoy the feeling of Greek cuisine with a creative unique way! Don't miss the desserts! Excellent in everything! Congratulations!",0
"Just wanted to share what a fantastic experience we had staying at Bill and Coo in lovely Mykonos. It's all fabulous but it's the service that really made it for me. The staff there are so gorgeous, attentive, thoughtful and funny - this is the best service we have received anywhere in the world. We had our 11 year old daughter with us and they were so sweet, fussing over her and chatting away to her, she was literally walking on air. The kind lady at the desk found me a proper hairdryer after I explained that I wasn't getting on with the one fitted in the bathroom - thank you, much appreciated. I also used the hotels complimentary concierge service and they kindly booked up all our restaurants and beach clubs, all super efficiently done. Again, very much appreciated.The hotel itself is stunning and beautifully maintained - small and boutique style but big enough to create a lovely ambience. Food and bar are both amazing and of course there is the view from their gorgeous pool area which is super special. One thing we found incredibly useful was the car service, particularly as the roads in Mykonos are a nightmare. They give you a little mobile phone when you arrive and when you leave anywhere just press a button and a lovely chap in a BMW comes to pick you up, we used this as lot to the level where we were referring to the drive as 'Dad'! What a great idea. Thank you to everyone at Bill and Coo.",4
"We had the pleasure of dining at the restaurant at Bill & Coo last night, we made our reservation for 8.30 so we had time for drinks and to watch the stunning sunset! The service and food were sublime.... Definitely worth a visit if you're staying in Mykonos.",1
"Bill and Coo restaurant came highly recommended and it exceeded all my expectations. It is situated in a luxury but understated hotel with an amazing view of the Myconos sunset. Very romantic and cool. It is really more of an experience rather than just a restaurant. After having drinks in the lounge, we got a welcoming drink (tzatziki cocktail and a small delicious snack). We also got to meet the chef before we started. We decided to go for the Bill & Coo experience (a set menu of at least 8 dishes) for EUR130 per person. There was another option with a set menu of three courses for EUR80 and a la cart menu as well. The experience started with amuse-bouche and a series of unbelievably tasty and interesting dishes. My family really enjoyed every single of them - our favorites were ravioli on rib eye, pork belly and cod. Deserts were fantastic too (two completely different ones plus an extra one). I was also impressed by the wine list - no need to spend a fortune and still enjoy a very nice and well-priced Greek wines. Overall, to me, this is the best restaurant in Myconos and we have checked quite a few (our fourth year in a row). Please keep it up, we will come back next year!",1
"Visiting our friends Stella Oia and Steve Metsovas at their home on Mykonos. First night dinner at Bill and Coo. Chef Athinagoras Kostakos lived up to his reputation with an amazing dinner. This team easily deserves one or more Michelin Etoile.We were greeted by a lovely food ambassador whose job was to guide us through the story of our meal. It sounded corny, but was executed brilliantly. A brief overview of the concept behind Chef's cooking style while being presented with an initial palate cleanser to prepare for the journey. After being escorted by our ambassador to our table overlooking the sea, we're overwhelmed by a menu describing dishes that demanded our attention. Even as a new round of Amuse Bouche arrived at the table, we decided that at least 6 appetizers had to be tried. Each was extraordinary in beauty, taste, and culinary execution. However, the Sea urchin ala Delos was devine (pun intended). We pushed on to entrees, each of which was unique and perfectly executed. Annie had Filet of Cod in a sea of avgolemono veloute. I had the winner. A two part homage to Chef's childhood labeled a Mousakka. This does not do justice. Each part was worthy of being a perfect entree. See pictures below. If you are a seeker of Chef's with stars in their future, Bill and Coo is a must to visit.",0
It's a fantastic property with beautiful views. Breakfast is very nice with lot's of options. The staff is very helpful but not as courteous as one would expect in a hotel of this level. Gym is quite a let down.,0
"We had the pleasure of staying at Bill and Coo last week for 4 nights. It is a wonderful hotel in a fantastic position, very close to Mykonos Town. The location is perfect as it is not right in the middle of the town, however a 7 - 10-minute walk with fantastic water views.Our room was one of the newly renovated rooms and was large, modern and had wonderful features like an IPAD to control everything within the room as well as a Sonos sound system. The shower and bathroom and amenities were excellent.Food at the hotel is wonderful, with a la carte breakfast served daily with many options, with one of Greece’s best chefs who runs an award winning gastronomic dinner menu.The pool area is fabulous, with a great view and relaxed tunes playing. Water is constantly served with no charge and all staff are extremely attentive. The setting encourages you to stay by the pool and unwind.What really makes this hotel are the people. A couple of names I remember: Stephanos, Funya, Demetri and Harris. But all are wonderful, genuine, caring and lovely people who do nothing else but want to make your holiday better.I highly recommend having a massage with Alexis who is honestly one of the best masseuses I have ever had.We have stayed in Mykonos before at other luxury hotels and Bill and Coo surpasses them all. I highly recommend and will be returning. Thank you to the team and apologies to the names of the team I didn’t remember – you were all amazing.   Room Tip: Request a renovated room as these have much larger rooms, bathrooms and modern technology features. See more room tips",1
"My family of 9 spent 3 wonderful nights at Bill and Coo. From the moment you walk in you are treated like royalty. The staff from the font desk, Stephano and his colleague to Harris and his team by the pool are so very warm and welcoming and offer exceptional service. I have read the other reviews on Bill and Coo and I am only repeating all the wonderful things that has already be said. It was an absolute pleasure staying there and I'm sure my family can hardly wait to revisit Bill and Coo next time we plan to go to Mykonos. Congratulations to all the staff .",0
What a beautiful hotel perfect albeit pricey it was amazing! The restaurant has the best food on the island and the pool is the most amazing on the island with pretty fairy lights on the bottom of the pool. If you can afford it do it the staff are lovely and sunsets are amazing,0
"Pure class from the moment I was greeted by one of the smiling staff at the airport. I stayed six nights, and could have stayed more. Everyone of the ( just right amount ) of staff were warm and friendly, and unlike some other reviewers who found this occasionally false, I really would disagree. I hadn't deluxe jacuzzi suite- and well... The view was something else. It was very difficult to force myself away from my terrace and get into Mykonos town, which is a 10/15 min walk on the coast road. Being a late riser, I partook of breakfast in the room several times. Always on time, and just right. The room was minimalist, great shower, very comfortable bed, well stocked mini-bar.I dined at the main restaurant on one occasion- and the welcome palate cleanser, the service and the actual food itself deserves a Michelin star at least probably two. Wonderful but subtle mixture of flavours that honestly I could actually still taste the morning after- they were still on the tongue. Yes- it is very expensive- but I was prepared for it, and not dissapointed. Only three mild issues: The 'lounge' music that is piped out constantly doesn't really need to be there, such is the view, and friendly atmosphere created by the staff. The gym facilities: as a runner you're catered for with a treadmill and an inspiring view of the coast, but I do feel they could expand it. Also, the swimming pool by the bar is visually lovely- but the lovely , stunning swimming pool by the bar and restaurant is visual more than practical. Few guests ventured in. Maybe they could create some space for a lap pool somewhere on the property? Then, Bill and Coo- which is pretty close to perfection , would be perfect. Genuinely.If my bank balance allows, I'll be back next year!",0
"This was the best dining experience I have ever had. The staff, service, setting, experience and food were truly exceptional. I can't wait to come back and try next year's Bill & Coo experience menu. Michelin need to award them a star! 8 course tasting menu was actually 12 courses if you include palate cleansers/amuse Bouche etc. A must if you are a foodie visiting Mykonos.",1
Just had a week here . I have to say it is one of the best hotels in the world I have stayed in. Service is excellent. The food in the gourmet Restraunt is in my opinion worthy of 2 or 3 Michelin stars and I don't say that lightly.The served breakfast is superb as well.We had a lovely room with patio and sun beds .Ok it's not cheap but the best never is .,0
"It was the closest to an Amman I have experienced outside of the Amman chain of hotels, the staff is very very friendly, rooms are great? Breakfast was terrific, try the poached eggs with bread all mixed with olive oil. They never ask you to sign anything if you order something at the pool, they just take it to your account. you order and you are treated like if you were at your home. Transportation service to everywhere on the island is a great service considering there are only 30 taxis in the whole island. We arrived a day late on a three night reservation because of a problem with my pregnant wife and they were very supportive, they offered my to stay my original third night at a 50 per cent rate.",0
"Had a lovely chilled out week in June at Bill & Coo. The hotel is small but this is a positive, service is excellent and the decor is beautiful. It was my first trip to Mykonos and I will return. Thanks to all the staff.   Room Tip: All rooms have sea view! See more room tips",0
"Probably one of the best dining experiences I have had... From the second you walk in the service is fantastic, the hostess introduces you to the chef and his team and the waiters will ensure that you get the best experience of this restaurant.The food is perfect and the little touches take it from exceptional to nearly perfect.I haven't even mentioned the views!! If you are after the whole package culinary experience whilst on holiday this is the place to g",0
"The infinity pool with the stars under your legs and views were breathtaking, the ideal location, only 10 minutes from the town by walk.Breakfast is always the best time for something juicy, fresh and greek delicatessen, it just feels like the right way to open the day. About the dinner, ""the gastronomy project"" exceptional taste crafted by Chef Athinagoras Kostakos, recipes inspired by the authentic Greek cuisine and the finest of international gastronomy. The restaurant situated by the pool of stars(architecture lighting, makes the feeling of the sky with the stars) Bill & Coo’s Gourmet Restaurant in Mykonos awakens all senses. Absolutely you will have five star experience.",0
"We were at the hotel 4 nights and enjoyed every minute. Especially want to commend Harris the waiter who treated us amazing, he was so nice and kind to us. All of the staff!!!. Of course we will return again !!!Danit, eliav, eran, daniel",1
"To start, to set the scene, if I was able I would use the TA system to rate this hotel higher than 5* / Excellent option. Having just returned from Bill & Coo Suites and Lounge (suite 223) Mykonos and re-read the other superlatives, I now understand first-hand just why this hotel is heaped with so much well-deserved praise.The Bill & Coo Suites and Lounge, simply put, is an outstanding hotel in all areas, particularly shining in terms of customer service, friendliness and professionalism as well as location and all-round all-too-rare quality. From the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty. You glide past the reception to be taken to the open area pool / lounge, offered a refreshing glass of water, home-made lemonade and tasty snacks all prepared in the restaurant. Check-in is seamless (our thanks to the ever-smiling lady on reception [sorry, we never did get your name] and Stefano) then taken to your suite. The view from the pool / lounge area across the infinity pool and out to the azure sea / Mykonos Town is stunning. The suites (no rooms here!) are spotless, light, cool, and airy and come complete with a daily cleaning and turndown service and quality, daily-replenished bathroom washing lotions, bottles of water, night-time cookies or cakes and a well-stocked mini-bar. Breakfast is unbeatable. You can order from the set menu suggestions, go a la carte or do what we usually did and mix and match a little from both. `Service with a smile` would be an understatement here; from the constantly replenished pastries, water, juice, tea and coffee, to the helpful tips and enquiries about your night or your plans for the day. Demetrious, Harris, Nicky (and others - we didn’t get your names) are a real credit and show what genuine quality and customer service is really like. Due to our late arrival and being a little jaded from travelling, we opted to dine in the Bill & Coo restaurant on our first night. Again, what an experience in fine dining `journey` (as we were informed!) from the too-numerous to recall, but excellent, tasty small appetisers, to starters and on to the main event of lamb and Sea Bream all accompanied by a surprisingly excellent (recommended by waiter) bottle of Greek sauvignon.The general feeling of serenity and calm here leads to an extremely chilled and relaxing holiday. When you settle down on the double loungers by the pool you’ll be kept refreshed by constant top up’s of chilled water, occasional melon and face-spritzers from Demetrious summing things up aptly by his “welcome to the Bill & Coo way of life”. Exactly!The hotel is only 20 mins walk / 10 mins car journey to the centre of Mykonos Town but Bill & Coo have that covered too, providing a free shuttle service at any time of the day up to 1:00 a.m. The town can be a little busy and confusing with the narrow winding streets but after a while you get used to it and some evenings don't even get lost! There are plenty of choices of restaurants (varying quality) and bars, some OK some not so. Local beaches are nice but less rough seas can be found a few miles away, particularly in the Ornos area. Beautiful sunsets from the town too.We would recommend Mykonos and in particular the Bill & Coo Suites and Lounge without hesitation. The hotel is a unique experience, very special, although as some others have commented, a little more expensive than usual, but well worth it and what a treat! Thank you all so much for helping make our all too brief holiday so magical - Demetrious, Nicki, Harris, Stefano, in fact all the waiting, restaurant, bar, reception and housekeeping team … the list goes on. We’ve highlighted a few people but in reality the whole team work together, with the sole aim of providing their guests with a wonderful experience, which they always achieve. We have been fortunate to stay in some top quality hotels in the UK and abroad and without doubt, in our experience, no-one and no-where comes close to the Bill & Coo. We hope to return soon.   Room Tip: Any suite facing the sea. In fact any suite in this hotel. Views from 2nd floor amazing See more room tips",1
"I dont usually write reviews but felt compelled to do so due to our experience here.Here are the highlights:1. highest quality hotel we have ever stayed at... comparable to the Ritz or the Four Seasons in the US but much more special due to the location.2. Service is like nothing you will experience in the US. Everywhere you turn someone wants to help or try and get you something (and they are not looking for a tip, in fact its not the norm to tip here). At breakfast there were 4 seperate people servicing our table for just my wife and I.3. Hotel is modern and just beautiful. The price point is high but its worth every penny. Everything in the room is controled by an Apple tablet, the lighting, AC, everything. The rooms are sooo nice!4. They provide you with a cell phone (small one to take with you at night) and if any point you have a question, need directions or need to get picked up from anywhere (free service) they will come right away or help you with anything you need.I could continue on here but bottom-line if you are looking for a special hotel that is top notch this is it. It totally made our honeymoon",0
"I knew it was the best choice from the very beginning-from the moment we were picked up by the driver, till the welcoming at the reception! The room was just amazing with the best sea view! We were traveling with our 5months old baby and it was very spacious and comfortable to accommodate us all!The most friendly staff I have ever met, willing to help even before you ask for help! The service by the pool was excellent! We always had cold water, cold face towels to freshen up and-the most refreshing-water spray offered by the staff every now and then! We didn't go out a lot so we tried almost everything on the menu! The food was delicious with the best ingredients, very well cooked!The breakfast was also very interesting, choosing from the a la carte menu either some fixed choices or making you own! The staff was always there to recommend and believe me..they always knew ;) We also had dinner at the very famous restaurant. Loved it!! It was a great experience starting from the moment entering the restaurant. Very inspired menu, a very attentive chef with a great team! Totally worth it!I would definitely go back!Miss it already ;)",0
"I really cant say much about Bill and Coo...just tha its a true 5 star hotel ! Room just perfect , pool and bar also amazing...the view of the hotel its breathtaking and last but not least the stuff of Bill&Coo are simply the best i have ever seen in a hotel ...they make you feel special!!!me and my wife are going back for sure!!!!",0
"Our stay in the Bill & Coo hotel was spot on! everything was just perfect! atmosphere, care, attention to customer, attention to detail, generosity and friendliness of the staff. Thank you Harris for my salt and olive oil! and thank you to everyone for making our stay to relaxing and memorable.",0
"Thank you for such a wonderful stay, to all staff at this beautiful hotel, thanking the wonderful Harris, Dimitrios, Nikki, Labros and Stefanos, what wonderful service always at our beck and call! A must if you are visiting Mykonos! Will be back for sure!",1
"We took a group of students to visit Bill and Coo to see a 5* boutique hotel and the welcome, service and all round experience was exceptional The general manager who took the time to speak to us about the hotel, guest expectations and gastronomic dining was amazing. A truly individual hotel which stands above the rest, promoting individual style, quality and excellent service. Thank you so much for allowing us to visit and giving us your time.... I would recommend this hotel to all who seek a unique, high end and extremely private experience on a truly beautiful island",3
"We have just returned from a perfect week at Bill & Coo. This 30-room boutique hotel is on a hill overlooking Megali Ammos beach and Mykonos Town. The town is about a 20 minute walk away, near enough to access easily but far enough to get a good night's sleep.The service is amazing; staff soon learn your name and nothing seems to be too much trouble. You're given a mobile phone that you can using during your stay: you can call their concierge service at any time to book a restaurant or to send transport to get you back to the hotel. Our room (114) was a Bachelor Suite. It had a super kingsize bed, sitting area, Nespresso machine, minibar, TV, Sonos wifi speaker, large rainshower and a lovely balcony with bistro set. There's an iPad mini for controlling the lighting, air conditioning and Sonos music (via Deezer). The air conditioning is quiet and bed supremely comfortable. There's a nightly turn down service, also providing a 500ml bottle of mineral water per person and a boxed biscuit (or other treat) at the bedside. Most people spend a lot of time around the pool. It's a great place to relax, chat and listen to the great music on offer. You're provided with glasses of mineral water, which are regularly topped up. Of course you can order any food or drink that you like. Occasionally little complimentary treats are offered: we particularly enjoyed the frozen pina colada shots!Breakfast by the pool is from the A La Carte menu. You can choose as much or as little as you like and the food is of excellent quality. We had lunch once. It was excellent but obviously priced accordingly. We thoroughly enjoyed our week and look forward to returning. Thank you so much!   Room Tip: All rooms overlook the sea, have a balcony or terrace. The sunsets are amazing! See more room tips",2
"From the phone given to you by Stefanos, which you can use until 3am to get a pick up from anywhere on the island, the ""Avene"" spritz for your face every hour from Dimitris while sitting at the pool, to the personal service given to you by Harris every morning while you order anything you want for breakfast to be made on the spot. This place really understands how to make you feel on holiday. It was also so cool and ""Monocle"" certified that we didn't feel the need to go anywhere else on two of the evenings we were there. And on the nights we came back at 3am, the staff happily made us a smack before we retired to bed! I am going back asap!",2
"Impeccable service that considered every aspect of our visit. The even began with a tzatziki palate cleanser and ended with a dessert trio called stairway to heaven. Texture, taste, temperature, aroma, and presentation were all finely crafted and described by the single best wait staff I have ever had. We only ate here at the pool deck, and did not experience the hotel. But dining there alone is a must do for couples with an interest in food.",3
"From the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we left Bill and Coo,we were treated with the finest service I've ever experienced. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Every meal was excellent and dining at the restaurant (although very expensive) is the ultimate food experience. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Bill and Coo and only wish we could have stayed longer.",0
"It started with a pick-up at the airport: very well on time, neat car, very friendly service en hot towels, water provided.Arriving in the hotel: we were welcomed, seated in the lounge and all personnel came to greet us, we received a drink and a tapa, were given a map of Mykonos and explained the to do’s-to go’s. Vacation feeling guaranteed.Then we were shown the room: very modern and beautiful – a tablet is given for the electronics control: lights, curtains, music (unfortunately the music rarely worked).A great start ... Overall:We are world travellers and have approximately 150 hotel stays per year – I can compare this hotel amongst the best hotels in the world. Fantastic stay in this hotel – really to be recommended. The beautiful lounge part is great! Only 30-ish rooms make you feel important vs being a number. Towels and drink water continuously refreshed, some fruit and smoothies provided during the day. The infinity pool is just wonderfully beautiful.The personnel gives service to perfection – never had this before. From opening your towels to filing your glass of water every time you drunk to a personal note and word at every opportunity – just top ! Harris kept the team well under his leadership ;)The food is gorgeous! The chef just makes everything being the best taste you ever had. The breakfast is included and is “a la carte”, whatever you chose, if is just wonderful. The reception is extremely helpful: from booking quad to any demand, Fania and her team are there for you; the BMW X5 is at service to bring you to the city or pick you up. At arrival you receive a Nokia cell phone with the Hotel’s telephone number, you can call them anytime for anything. Top!",1
"Wow. What an amazing hotel. I can only reiterate the comments that other guests have made. The service from the staff is outstanding - everyone is so friendly, so efficient and so attentive yet without being intrusive. It's a fairly small, intimate hotel and you do get to know everyone quite quickly so it does help when they are all so fabulous! There is the most wonderful pool area with an outstanding view. Chill out & relaxing during the day on the large double sun loungers and enjoy the constant supply of complimentary water, the daily cocktail shot and some fabulous music! At night it's a super setting by the pool bar to watch the sun go down with a fabulous cocktail (they make some good ones!) before having dinner in the restaurant which matches the standard of any Michelin restaurant I've visited. Breakfast is fantastic - a la carte freshly prepared which I personally much prefer to a buffet style. Rooms are spacious with a large comfortable bed and high quality duvet and pillows and a great mattress topper. We opted for a room with hot tub on the terrace but, in all fairness, the pool area is so welcoming we didn't really use it. Location is excellent - a 10 minute stroll into the fantastic Mykonos town with its quaint streets filled with so many high standard restaurants, bars and designer shops. There's an old port area lined with eateries and bars and a sunset strip so something different to do every night. And don't forget the beach clubs, there are some good ones! Reception will help with suggestions and will arrange travel so it's really easy. Mykonos is chic, sophisticated and classy - which also sums up Bill & Coo. We will certainly be returning next year.",2
"My husband and I have just returned from our week honeymoon at Bill and Coo. Overall we had an amazing stay. The real positives for us were;1. The location - easy 10 minute walk to the main town and great view over the bay.2. Rooms were fabulous - we were in one of 2 honeymoon suites - suite 206. It was at the end of the hotel - quiet, spacious and fab private terrace with a hot tub. Just a note for any honeymooners the other suite looks over the pool - stunning but less private. And the beds... I slept better than I do at home!!3. Service - top notch! Friendly and attentive - but not overbearing. Only slight disappointment is that we did have to remind the hotel on day 2 it was our honeymoon but the manager was clearly equally disappointed and took steps to make it right and we accept things happen - and it doesn't change the fact that service here is fabulous! 4. The gorgeous infinity pool and pool area - I would say that shade can be an issue as the umbrellas and beds are fixed to the floor. We did mention it to the manager as feedback during our stay. 5. Food and drinks - are great. It's been said before that it is very pricey and it is. If I am honest we would probably have eaten and drunk more at the hotel if the prices had been a little lower. An example is in town a cocktail would be 10-14 euro whereas the hotel prices are circa 20-22 euro. Having said that - the overheads here will be high - the service is as I have said amazing and drinks come with a selection of nuts and olives. In summary - this is a gem of a hotel and really very special. We would come back without question.",2
"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times over the last 3 years. The location is great. Close to the city of Mykonos although you better take a car to go. The hotel has a relaxed atmosphere and the service is very good. They emphasize on high quality service. My best advices if you stay there try the restaurant. Excellent food, Michelin star quality.The staff is trained to be as polite it can get. This sometimes seems to be disingenuous since the polite manner does not match effectivity in problem solving. A good example to that is the hotel manager. I asked for the same room as the first time I visited. A GREAT room with a pool, but with a major design problem. The wc (toilet seat) is only divided from the room with a glass dividing wall and a glass door only partially hiding the person sitting on the toilet.As intimate as you feel with your other half I don't thing you want to share these private moments.When we first stayed at the hotel the manager came to us asking us about the room since he said it was just the first year used. I told him about the wc ""problem"" and he confirmed that many previous guest had stated the same and it for sure would be fixed.2 years later nothing has changed. So why be so pretentious telling us how important our opinion was since he had no intention to change anything? I totally dislike people that pretend to be interested in one’s opinion when they are only interested to show a good face.The same comment goes on our second remark about the restaurant seats that are declining to the front being a bit uncomfortable.In short. bill & coo is an excellent hotel. With good service. they don't need to exaggerate playing totally interested. I would appreciate honesty more than exaggerated politeness   Room Tip: its worth getting a good room. private pool or jacuzzi See more room tips",1
"My best friend and I started here 3 nights while visiting Mykonos. We had a two bedroom - absolutely stunning. The service, food and property were perfect. It was an easy walk into Mykonos town too. Very much recommend this hotel if you are looking for luxury!",2
"Just come back from our 13th annual tour with our closest friends ! 13 unlucky for some but DEFINATELY not us ! We had the most amazing time in probably the best place we hv ever stayed ! From the moment we arrived the staff went above and beyond, the attention to detail was perfection ! Even to the point of when we were leaving my friend needed something that they didn't have and they sent a driver out to go and get it and would accept any payment ! I could go on and on about this hol but mainly I would like to thank Harris, Dimitri 1,Dimitri 2 the chef and the owner for making our holiday total perfection we shall DEFINATELY be back",3
"I cannot sing the praises of this hotel highly enough. We were there three nights to celebrate our anniversary, and throughout our stay we experienced the best service of our lives. The staff is attentive to every detail and anticipated many of our needs and desires. The food is spectacular, from breakfast through the haute gastronomie of their dinner service. The views are marvelous, the rooms are spacious and very well-appointed, and the location -- a 10-minute walk outside of Mykonos Town -- is hard to beat. In fact, it was such an oasis, we ended up spending much more time at the hotel than we had planned. I only wish the weather had been a bit warmer, so that I could have whiled away a few hours in the stunning infinity pool.Many places give you a luxury price tag and/or a luxury name but don't live up to either. Bill & Coo exceeded every expectation, and I recommend it without reservation.   Room Tip: It didn't look like there was a bad room. We were in an upper room, and our views were excellent... See more room tips",1
Bill & Coo - what a gorgeous stay we had. Staff were sincerely welcoming - wouldn't let us lift a finger. Panos the Manager went above & beyond his services to make everything perfect.The food was exceptional - the views are to die for. The beds - the most comfortable I've slept on. The owner would always come & say hello & recommend us places on the island to visit.Our stay was worth every single penny & more. Bill & Coo we cannot wait to return.,1
"I'll start this by saying that we stayed at Bill & Coo in June 2015. We hadn't wanted to rush this review because we wanted it to be right. Overall, this hotel is entierly deserving of its praise and its recent introduction into the Luxury Hotels of the World. We are a young couple from England and for us this hotel was a splurge (although very reasonable all considering). I had never been abroad before this holiday and my partner never to Greece. I think it is fair to say that we will never have another holiday as special and that is entierly down to the dedication of Bill & Coo's staff. When we arrived into Mykonos airport, we were greeted by a porter from the hotel who immediately took hand of our luggage and ushered us into a Mercedes. We were given hot towels. When we arrived to the hotel, all of the reception staff came out to greet us and we were sat in the pool area to welcome drinks and a shrimp appetiser. We were introduced to the island with maps and recommendations etc. We were told that the room we had booked (a double with jacuzzi on the balcony) unfortunately wasn't available for our stay as there had been a plumming problem, so for our first night we were put in one of their standard rooms with a balcony. This was still an upgrade as there were two adjoining doubles and two bathrooms. We were brought yet more drinks and water to our room, along with some small cakes and nuts (all complimentary). We stayed there for our first night and were then moved into the Honeymoon Suite. The reception staff were wonderfully accomodating throughout everything. Porters were called to come and take our luggage and move it upstairs. It was as though nothing was ever too much trouble. The Honeymoon suite was beautiful; minimal in its design, stylish and huge. We had our jacuzzi on a private balcony looking out to sea, equipped with two sun loungers. We very rarely made it down to the pool to sun bathe because we didn't need to. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We ordered room service one night and can only say that the food was superb. On another night, we ate in the restaraunt, and though without a booking, the staff were wonderful to find space for us. We met the Head chef and his staff before we sat for dinner and were given tomatoes stuffed with risotto and a liquer. Experiences like this (which were custom at Bill & Coo) are still unmatched for us. The ten courses we enjoyed were all wonderful and the staff were so knowledgable and passionate about every dish. Following on from this, the breakfast selection was incredible. We would sit down each morning excited for what we would have that day. As everything is a la carte, we were careful not to order too much, but special thanks must go out to the staff who when we ordered one croissant each, brought us four. We became addicted to the feta stuffed pastries part of the Mykonian breakfast. As well as the food you order, you are brought round plates of cheese, continental meats, fresh fruit. We were able to joke with the staff whose service was tongue-in-cheek and playful. The main pool was beautiful and even more so at night. We sat one morning on the lounge chairs overlooking the sea and within minuets a man had rushed over to move a table closer for us and with glasses of iced water. The staff here truly go above and beyond what is expected. I only wish I could remember names so they could be credited accordingly. Our holiday would certainly not have been the same without Bill & Coo and we are already planning ways we can go back. We both fell in love with Mykonos but more over Bill & Coo and its staff, who are the real stars. We are both determined to travel, but somehow when planning our next trips we keep going back to thoughts of this holiday, and joke that we may need never go anywhere else ever again. When we asked one waiter how he was that day, he responded: ""I'm wonderful, how could I not be happy in a place like this?"" and I have to agree.",3
"Truly one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Suites are extremely clean and well kept. The bar/pool area is gorgeous, truly feels like a 5 star hotel. Staff is incredible and extremely helpful. Highly recommend.",2
"Well this hotel has to be one of the real luxurious on my scale of hotels. We spotted a couple of celebrities a while there and you can see why this is such a hotspot.Firstly the whole hotel is simply chic, classy and very well decorated and maintained. The staff are so professional and very smart that tipping them almost feels embarrassing! They cannot do more and are always aware of any discomforts guests may be feeling, they seem to have this sixth sense - what I think is just very considerate and conscious staff.We had a jacuzzi suite which had an iPad to operate all the fancy gadgets and also a personal mobile phone to call for service from anywhere in the hotel. The room was spacious with beautifully white and relaxing interiors. The views out to sea were lovely.The breakfast at this place was just very special with a la carte menu where you could order your eggs to your preferred style and endless fancy options. It was all very good.The beach beds are comfy and spacious and the staff come around offering face mist and cleaning of sunglasses.I had a massage which was also very impressive and worth the money.Would I go back - yes please!",0
"out of this world, amazing suites, amazing service, amazing location, I am addicted to Bill & Coo Suites and Lounge, we will definitely come back for more days and with more friends. Little note: the food is delicious",0
"Think....... What do you seek in Mykonos holidays?Fun , nightlife, extravaganza unforgettable moments?This hotel suits all the above. Near all the sinister places and yet secluded enough you can have it all. Discretion and pampering included. Expensive and overrated yes! But that's Mykonos! If you are looking value for money.... Stay home. Here the money pours quicker than tequila shots!",2
When you travel to Mykonos you have to try this Restaurant it's a fantastic place to be;) great traditional greek food created very modern:) the best creek chef.The view from the restaurant is one of the best for a beautiful sunset.Great drinks served by a fantastic staff.Try it and you'll be happy after this experience:,1
"We were here on our honeymoon in May 2014 and loved it. We were greeted with cocktails upon arrival and we received some champagne and fruit delivered to our room shortly after check in. The infinity pool is awesome. Although the drinks at the pool are rather expensive (~$30), they are really delicious.The best part of our stay besides the poolside cocktails was our dinner at the hotel restaurant. This was unexpected but after telling a random waiter in Santorini where we were planning to stay in Mykonos, they advised us to eat at the restaurant. We decided to heed her advice and were so glad we did. My husband and I consider ourselves ""foodies"" and would say this was one of the best meals we've ever had. The breakfast that was included in our stay was also quite amazing. Everything was so fresh and well prepared.   Room Tip: Eat dinner at the restaurant, it's amazing. See more room tips",2
"From the minute we were picked up from the port, we were treated with excellent service. We were even upgraded to a suite with a hot tub when we arrived (where we witnessed the best sunsets, even blowing away those of Santorini). The staff was super friendly and accommodating. Close walk to Mykonos town and a pretty, relaxing beach across the street. Check out Joanna's Nikos Place for a great meal.Only a few complaints, one being it was a bit too ""bougie"" and pretentious for my husband and I. Also, review the bill when checking out. Hit us with a few charges on things that were supposed to be included. Overall, happy with our stay.",1
"Incredible staff. Everyone was so friendly. They made great recommendations for food and activities. Although I could have never left the hotel and been entirely content. The pool and views were breathtaking. The location is ideal- very quiet and serene, but an easy walk to Mykonos town. One of the best places I've ever stayed.",2
"Upon our arrival we were treated with top notch, professional service. The hotel is quiet and beautiful. It's very clean and has everything you ever need. The location is an easy 10 minute walk to the quaint town of Mykonos where we loved exploring. We ate at the hotel for a gourmet meal which exceeded our expectations. Breakfast was fabulous, from the Greek yogurt and honey to the homemade marmalade and chocolate. Eggs, breads, pastries, meats, fruits, all delicious and served to you impeccably. The assistance we received from the front desk was always helpful! We loved Bill & Coo and wished we could have stayed longer rather than travel to Santorini. Thank you for a great experience.   Room Tip: We had a room overlooking the sea and with a Jacuzzi and sunbed on the patio! Room 223 See more room tips",4
September is the perfect month to visit this lovely hotel its still nearly full but the whole island seems more relaxed.The front of house manager is amazing and her knowledge of the best restaurants bars beaches is fantastic.Every recommendation was perfect.The restaurant is lovely and a must on at least on night during your stay.Breakfast is another lovely experience with majestic views across the sea.Our standard room was lovely but some of the others look great so consider upgrading.Lastly the location of this great hotel is perfect being just minutes out of town .Last bit of advice?Go!ECDLondon   Room Tip: All are good See more room tips,4
"The hotel sits up high in a great view location, but it has many flaws. #1 the view is sometimes obstructed right in your face by a large telephone pole, (room 101) The hotel conveniently doesn't seem to notice it. But you definately will. And for the prices you pay to stay and eat there, they should call it a ""room with partial view"" not a full view and charge full price.#2 no pools are heated, not even the main pool, which is strange. so when you ""get upgraded"" to a great room with a pool? As they will do, you can't swim in it. Lol, they failed to mention it. Conventiently.#3 Then there's weird things like laundry room air vents that randomly shoot out of walls at your feet as your walking to your room, or a red fire extinguisher sitting in the beautiful landscape. Then here's a funny one, my bathroom window opens to my neighbors hot tub, oopps he was naked. So whoever designed this hotel, was just not that smart. The staff was great, super friendly, the food was tiny and gourmet, their idea of rack of lamb is 1 small rib, 1, not 8. So dont come hungry. Im not a perfectionist, but there were to many flaws. I dont believe for a second ""celebrities stay here"". Nope. Just dont buy that story.",1
"Professional and cost little hotel. Pro: clean, nice big room, friendly staff, gorgeous pool facing the sea, relatively clogs to town, comfy bed, fantastic breakfast spreadCons: close to town but still at good 10-15 min walk. Car/bike highly recommended, gym is smal",2
"Stayed with my wife here for 11 days in October in a Jacuzzi suite (room 222). Stunning Hotel. Could not fault anything about the experience. From the minute we arrived at the Hotel the service from the staff was impeccable, nothing was too much trouble. Special mention must go to Terry and Jacob the evening bar waiters and Dimitris at Breakfast for making our holiday experience perfect. The room was cleaned twice daily, and every evening we were left a tip for the following day at our bedside along with an evening treat. The food at the hotel was delicious. We tried most things on the lunch/room service menu by the time we left and could not fault anything. Breakfast was superb, especially my personal favourite, 'The Mykonian Breakfast', which included a selection of traditional Greek dishes. The Hotel is located a short walking distance to the main town,10 mins, and 5 mins downhill to a beautiful coved beach. We loved every minute of our stay here, never anywhere have we experienced such incredible hospitality and service. Would not hesitate for one moment about recommending Bill & Coo Suites. May we express our most gracious thanks to all at Bill & Coo for an unforgettable Holiday.",4
"We came to Greece for our 20th Anniversary. We were met at the airport & transported to Bill & Coo by one of their drivers. Our driver provided much appreciated facecloths to refresh ourselves after traveling a long way from Atlanta, GA - USA to get to Mykonos. The staff spoke perfect English. Check in was an incredible experience, which took me by surprise. Staff took our bags to our suite while we were escorted to the bar and supplied with a complimentary local snack and drink while we completed our check in paperwork. Music from the bar serenely serenaded us as we looked out over an incredible ocean vista. Our suite #212 was on the first floor (a few doors down from the bar) and had an amazing view of the ocean. At first, I was a bit worried about the noise from the bar, but there was none. I would recommend this room for the view alone. The suite decor was serene, complete w/plenty of outlets, soft linens, and a good-sized bathroom. While the hotel is luxurious and really a wonderful place to stay, it's the staff that makes the experience at Bill & Coo so incredibly spectacular. Thoughtful gestures such as complimentary water and snacks randomly brought to our room without asking, they all learned our names from the get-go, and provided us with plenty of guidance as we planned out our days in Mykonos. The included breakfast was a feast and a delight - the wait staff friendly and anticipated our every desire. Yes, a latte is 4e additional at breakfast, but their coffee Americano w/warm cream was delicious and flowing, so that was sufficient. They helped us rent an ATV to tour the island and we were glad we arranged everything through the hotel because we heard horror stories from other travelers who rented from local places in town but their vehicles broke down, whereas ours ran great. While we didn't use all of the hotel amenities, we saw other guests enjoying sunbathing on the bed lounges, complete with staff spritzing them with a cooling water spray (if desired). The hotel was a short walk into town, and so we did that every night and it was a beautiful, short walk. I honestly can't think of a single complain to share about this hotel. It was well worth the price. If we came back, I would stay here in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.   Room Tip: Room facing ocean is well worth it. We had room 212 and loved it. See more room tips",1
"Had the most relaxing 8 days in an amazing resort. Some of the best service I've encountered, great setting and beautifully simple rooms.No check-in here, it's a proper welcome ritual with paperwork all done behind the scenes. This is echoed in the amazing restaurant - voted one of the best in Greece - where the attention to detail is astonishing. Attention to detail sums up the establishment but I won't spoil all the surprisesMy only change I would ask would be for a few more options on the lunch/all day menu as after a few days it becomes a bit repetitive. Whilst there was nothing stopping us going elsewhere we were so in love with the place we preferred to have lunch here. Maybe a couple more specials would help but this is really a minor comment.   Room Tip: Choosing a room with hot tub is a great way to watch the sun go down See more room tips",0
"Stayed here for a week in September and it was amazing.The location, the view from the pool, the comfy double sunbeds, everything! The staff are excellent, friendly and attentive but not overbearing.We upgraded to a suite with a Jacuzzi on the balcony and it was definitely worth it as we could watch the amazing sunsets from the Jacuzzi.They give you a mobile for your stay so that you can contact the concierge whenever you need them.The WIFI is free and reliable. And the food was delicious.So why the 4 stars and not 5?Two things that are pretty important to me, the hotel was full when we stayed there and unfortunately there are not enough sunbeds for everyone. I’m surprised none of the other reviewers have mentioned this as it’s a pretty big thing (well for me anyway). By 9.30-10am all the beds would be taken.And, the room was very big and had lots of space, but the bathroom by comparison was tiny, there was hardly any shelf space and the light was not bright enough for grooming which on a ‘beach’ holiday is pretty important.I also agree with some of the comments regarding prices, when I stay at luxury hotels I expect the prices to be higher than normal, but I think that charging 5euros for a tiny bottle of coke may be taking things a little bit too far, you can buy one twice the size at the shop down the road for 1,20euros. And the extra charge for a cappuccino just seems plain greedy.However, I would definitely recommend the hotel and would probably stay here again the next time I visit the beautiful island of Mykonos",1
"I have now visited Bill and Coo 5 times! When we arrived we were greeted with ""welcome home"" by the staff on duty. The team at Bill and Coo make it look easy and deliver.. every time! Nothing is ever too much trouble, suggestions always made and they are happy if you are happy. It is by no means easy to pull that off and still come across as genuine..There have been some welcome additions to the hotel since we stayed last and these have only made things better.. New sun beds, new casual dining restaurant.. Panos the manager is always around to answer any query and offers advice at every given moment. Makis, Dimitris, Teddy in the restaurant and lounge are faultless - every time. Panos and Panos in the bar remember every special request and look after you like an old friend.. Drivers John and Spiros were exceptional and very helpful! I dont feel I need to comment on the rooms - they are superb - no change there.Panos and the team at Bill and Coo - Well Done. Your amazing. See you in 2016   Room Tip: Sea View Suites - Everytime.. See more room tips",1
"This hotel just set the standard for luxury on the island of Mykonos. The design, the staff, the food, the poolside amenities, made our week long stay at the property felt positively ethereal and otherworldly. I think the staff has really gotten down the science of how to anticipate customer wants without feeling like they’re in your face each time. The staff within a day learned each of our names in our party and would make breakfast feel like you were having a meal in your own living room despite a view fit for gods. The room appointments, the service levels are all impeccable and well worth the price/value of the location. I highly recommend.",4
"I have traveled to many 5 star resorts and never had such service with smile. From the time you check in and are given your own personal cell phone to contact the concierge 24 hours a day from anywhere on the island, to the constant attention you are given on site, pampering is the name of the game at this hotel. I can't say enough about this little gem.",2
"We booked this hotel because of the Restaurant I love my food and I wanted to experience the food by one of the greatest chefs in Greece Athinagoras Kostakos and I was not disappointed with one bit. The room service, views, pool, reception, dining area were amazing I loved every minute of my stay here. I can honestly say the night we booked into the restaurant it was out of this world and I totally recommend this hotel to anyone heading to Mykonos. The experience was amazing and the best service. The 2 bedroom apartment we stayed in was beautiful and built very well and sound proof there was2 bathrooms as well but the only problem was one bathroom didn't have a hand basin but the master bathroom had two not sure why this was this way, having a shower toilet etc but no hand basin very strange.",0
"We had 4 nights here and the hotel was just amazing! Lovely room, and my husband just loved the mini iPad to turn on the lights, aircon, and Sonos music! Breakfasts excellent and you could order a la carte from an extensive menu, and we ate here one evening, on the normal menu, and the food was very good. What is so outstanding here are the staff who constantly and discretely run around all day looking after your every need....always a glass of cold water by you if you are by the pool, extra treats like a slice of watermelon, and they will organise anything you want to do....they really are fantastic. Fania, the Front Office Manager, was so helpful in sorting out a booking problem, and we can't thank her enough. A wonderful stay...",2
"I cannot WAIT to come back to Bill & Coo!!My fiance and I stayed at Bill & Coo in May this year and we are so glad we did. Absolutely everything was amazing, from the breakfast, to the room and the pool area. Not forgetting the fabulous restaurant, where we ate twice in 9 days! The staff were SO friendly and helpful. We actually arrived quite early, so expected our room not to be ready, that was no problem. We were told to sit down, relax and given some complimentary nibbles and drinks to wash away our travels. Then one of the reception team provided us with a map of Mykonos and advised the best places to go, which made our stay even better, due to our love of bars and restaurants. Then earlier than expected, they allowed us to our very spacious room. We booked a room with a private Jacuzzi and it was perfect for the evenings after walking back from town. The hotel is a short walk away from the main town, which is perfect and the views are stunning and our routine quickly turned into a walk to the main town every night. We were very lucky to have fantastic weather for our stay, which made it even more special.We also took advantage of the onsite spa and treated ourselves to massages, which were great.Thank you Bill & Coo for the much needed and restful holiday and we look forward to seeing you again soon!   Room Tip: Either go for a private pool or Jacuzzi room! See more room tips",4
"We knew nothing about this hotel before going and were blown away by the service, food and crowd at this place! You will not find better service and friendlier staff anywhere in the world and I travel a lot! They make you feel like you are a guest in their home and it never feels like a hotel.The food is exceptional. Breakfast and lunch are delicious and faster than you could make it yourself. Dinner is out of this world! Chef Athinagoras Kostakos is a young culinary genius. Be sure to have the sea urchin bloody mary.If you are not looking to party until sunrise, this is the perfect place. It is right next to the party, but not IN the party. We made several great friends that we will be sure to see again in the future, many of whom have been coming back to this hotel for years. The hotel is full of interesting, fun people in their 30's and older and we really felt sad to leave.I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Mykonos...   Room Tip: Rooms in the new wing have better bathrooms. See more room tips",3
"This was our 4th time at the Bill & Coo and we love the place it really deserves the accolades it is now receiving, although I hope it won't spoil the atmosphere and attract the wrong crowd!We love everything about the hotel and the staff are exceptional who really do give your stay an extra special lift.We will be back next year, already looking forward to it - no better place to stay in Mykonos or Greece!   Room Tip: The left hand side of the hotel See more room tips",2
Loved everything about this hotel. I would come back again! The food was exceptional (I don't say this easily!). Our room was gorgeous and the view spectacular. It has the most amazing pool and the staff is extremely friendly and professional. 10/10!,1
"Service and location was very goodGood design hotelReserve gym for private use ahead of timeSmall number of sun beds by the pool so you need to grab one before breakfastReally liked the additional complementary touches in the rooms, like the mini I pad to regulate room temperature and lighting also you can play music from their playlists, also gave you use of mobile phone to contact concierge when outside and of course the practical nespresso machine.   Room Tip: Renovated Bachelor suite See more room tips",2
"From the moment we were picked up at the airport until our goodbyes the staff at Bill and Coo were without fault. Drinks overlooking the pool to where the sun sets, own private spa and sunbathing area, fabulous food in the outdoor restaurant, sumptuous breakfasts, care and detail to every aspect of guests needs - this was truely the best experience.",2
"Fantastic hotel with brilliant service. We were here at the end of August for 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. We stayed in one of the larger rooms with balcony and jacuzzi - found the latter somewhat redundant to be honest. The main pool deck is gorgeous and you are truly pampered by the fantastic staff - hat tip to Dimitris whom we took a particular shine to. The only negative ? Agree with others about the irritation of finding extra charges at breakfast for relatively insignificant items, management should take note of these kind of repeated comments rather than fob guests off with the excuse that 'Mykonos is an expensive island...' We all know that's the case ! If I could have awarded 4.5 stars then I would have done so but as we had such a fab time.....",3
"First class service, the best . Very friendly staff, could not do enough for you. Rooms very clean, cleaned twice a day. Excellent food, some of the best I have tasted, try the pork. sea view scenery,Holiday stay one of the best I have had. Would highly recommend.",0
"Overall a stunning property. Very hip, stylish and with great service overall. However, as much as I loved it, the price is simply exorbitant for what you get in terms of the actual room and agree with previous reviewer who was irked by the niggly additional charges for breakfast for things like a cappuccino or latte (when you are paying almost 1000 Euros per night this is rather insulting). But loved our stay overall and location is also great (just outside town but within walking distance).",2
"Great room with terrace & hot tub, clean and modern. Service is friendly and very polite. Pool has stunning views and lovely loungers, looks stunning after dark. Relaxing atmosphere, and food at dinner is exceptional. My only negative really is breakfast. Very disappointing and overly fussy, with additional charges on many items, including a basic cappuccino or smoothie; which in my mind is unnecessary and really rather greedy on the hotels part, certainly not the norm for a hotel that charges €900 per night. For this reason I will rate it with four stars.",4
Cannot recommend highly enough- true professionals work here and operate an amazing boutique hotel. Attention to detail with no pretence and fabulous humour from staff. Have been totally indulged. Will only stay here again when we return to Mykonos,2
"My wife and I stayed a bunch of nice places while traveling for a month in Europe on our honeymoon; however, Bill & Coo was easily our favorite. The room do have a bit of a high price tag, but they are easily worth every penny! The service at the hotel was outstanding. They have thought about every little detail to make sure that you have a perfect stay while you are in Mykonos. The pool deck is incredible! We will definitely be back!!!",0
"Beautiful boutique hotel. Fantastic service at anytime of the day - really impeccable staff. We had an upgraded suite and the views, interior and private pool were simply amazing. Great vibe, drinks, and fantastic breakfast at the restaurant. Highly recommend Bill & Coo.",1
Second visit to hotel so we obviously like it. Food excellent from breakfast to dinner. The kindest and most helpful staff you could ask for is the main attraction. Only downside is the price compared to the luxuriousness of room. You would get more in UK,2
"This hotel had one very big flaw that I just can't get past. There is nothing wrong with it. Which leaves me with nothing to criticize regarding our 3 night stay in an executive suite at Bill & Coo. So all I can say is this: Impeccable, perfect, incredible Bill & Coo, I miss you already and I will be back! And then the following:Check in by the pool with a welcome drink and amuse bouche. I don't normally eat sardines but when I'm at Bill & Coo I do!Handwritten welcome note with pastries and wine in our room. Jacuzzi on our balcony from which we drank champagne and watched the Mykonos sunset. Degustation menu served with such creativity and theatrics that Heston Blumenthal would be impressed. Restaurant staff whose light-hearted and not-over-the-top clownish approach, together with prompt and thorough attention to detail, put every guest in a good mood. Greek goddesses on the reception who were unfailingly competent, attentive, and top-notch. And gorgeous in their crisp white dresses! Driver who recognised us as hotel patrons on foot, quite a way down the road, and he pulled over just to give us a lift into town. Night time treats and weather forecast next to our bed. Who could ask for anything more? Bill & Coo is simply the best!",4
"We spent a week here, never having been to this hotel before, one week in Mykonos and then on to Oia, Santorini for the second week. Everything was perfect, excellent room, helpful, charming staff. The restaurant here is quite exceptional. Although we normally eat out in town, we did eat in the hotel restaurant for both dinner and lunch, the food is expensive but an experience not to be missed. I recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a top class hotel in Mykonos. It is a fifteen minute walk into town, or 25 minutes down to the harbour, but most decent hotels are on the edge of Mykonos town and you get used to the walks.",3
"Firstly, this hotel is all about service. It is as good as you will find anywhere. Simply, they cannot do enough for you. The treatment is as though you are family.When we arrived we had an issue with our original room and this was dealt with in a very polite way and the next day we were transferred into a different room which became a very comfortable home for 10 days.Because it is a small hotel you get to meet everyone , from the GM to the owner. The Chef who is a celebrated chef and considered to be one of the top chefs in Greece greets you personally and is a delightful young man.Breakfast is served A-la Carte, and the mornings were brighter with Demetrius who is a wonderful character and makes breakfast a delight.The pool area is integrated with the restaurant and bar along with the casual dining area. The sun beds are all double beds and are very comfortable. Although sometimes it is difficult for one person to get shade when the other partner wants full on sun. Also you cannot move the bed into the suns direction. One gripe is that in the evening when coming down for sunset drinks there are no areas (apart from the casual dining tables) where 2 couples can sit comfortably to have a cocktail.The gym is very basic with a treadmill and a cross trainer and a basic multi gym and some free weights.All in all a wonderful hotel and one i would recommend highly as it has something very special about the whole experience.,   Room Tip: 22 and 105 Very nice rooms.Great terracing and very bright.Lovely sea views. See more room tips",2
"We just got back from Bill and Coo last night. This hotel has a breathtaking view, great pool, cocktails and (bar / pool) food - but most of all amazingly professional yet personal staff. Even though the hotel is not in the town, it is only a 10 minute walk and actually we preferred to relax with the views, high up over the bay where the hotel is located. Mykonos town is great for lunch or a night out but it is so nice to return to Bill and Coo for the sunset or for quiet mornings. Very relaxed, very chilled, just superb all round.   Room Tip: If you go for the 2 bedroom suite (214), note that it has 2 bathrooms but neither are en suite. See more room tips",1
Things that are great.1. Picked up in fancy transportation 2. Very friendly driver with water and wet towels.3. Arrived in lobby and greeted with an apitizer and shot of tomato puree.4. We were shown the aminities of hotel and met most all employees.. everyone friendly with smiles.5. Shown to room where they delivered our luggage 5 min later. Found out it was hotel manager giving us the tour.6. 5 min later 2 men showed up with more treats and bottle of water7. Hotel room top for on the corner gorgeous view and pretty purple intierior. (Wife loves this)8. Ac is cold as can be!!! Awesome9. Love this place and we have been here 30 min,2
"I have been visiting Mykonos for 20 years and this is the best hotel I've stayed at in Mykonos. Breathtaking views, a great pool/bar/restaurant zone especially at night, and well equipped rooms make it a special stay. It was easy to spend days at the hotel, and equally close to Mykonos town to wander in, or to arrange a transfer with the hotel to visit beaches. The breakfast menu was extensive, and the service very attentive. We dined in the fine dining restaurant one night and it was an excellent and must-do experience if you stay here. The food was amazing. We would definitely recommend Bill & Coo.",3
"A coworker who came to Mykonos shortly before I came gushed about her stay at Palladium, and that was enough to convince me to book - and I'm SO glad I did!! I was honestly floored by my experience there, from the refresher towel and welcome glass of champagne at check in, to having the most amazing host who made sure our whole stay exceeded expectations - Thanos, you're amazing!!Since we were just two girl friends in Mykonos for a few nights, we booked the most basic room (a standard double, I believe) but Thanos whisked us into the most amazing room on the property, complete with our own private garden, pool, and jacuzzi. It was UNREAL. We couldn't stop gushing over how gorgeous it was!! But even outside of the amazing hospitality shown to us, the property itself is absolutely gorgeous. Very clean, minimalist white styling as is typical in Mykonos, and the pool's starry floor is a sight to see at night, and any room overlooking it must have a treat of a view. The room service menu was extremely reasonably priced, which was super convenient. Breakfast is extensive and delicious.The location puts you within a stone's throw of Nammos, which is a strong selling point itself :-D It's also not to far from Scorpio's, which was a highlight of our time in Mykonos.I'll definitely return to Palladium the next time I come to Mykonos!!!",0
"Maybe the room walls are a bit thin, other than that a lovely hotel. Nicely decorated.Nice reception area. great balcony.We will return for sure, its on the quite side of Mykonos, a 10 minute bus journey.",0
"We loved this place. Great staff - Thanos, Stavros and Dionysis were standouts - friendly, helpful and most hospitable. Our rooms were clean, comfortable and well appointed. The breakfast was outstanding - so much food and plenty of variety. The pool and pool bar offered a great place to ""step down"" after hanging at the beach all day - thanks again to Dionysis. Its an short walk to Platis Gialos and Platis Psarou - straight down the road to Gialos or hang a right half way down to hike down to Psarou. The walk up the hill wasn't too bad - especially knowing the pool bar awaited. Its all about the beach in Mykonos - so staying close to two beautiful beaches is the way to go in our opinion. Plenty of restaurants nearby and a taxi/bus ride to Mykonos town. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend the hotel to everyone.",0
"Best hotel in Mykonos by far, great service, incredible location i recommend this hotel very much to anyone traveling to Mykonos, ask for Thanos he can do anything you wish for he is the best !! Great experience thank you very much !!!   Room Tip: I had a room that connected to the hotel pool it was excellent because we could walk right into the... See more room tips",0
"The hotel concierge is extremely friendly, and provide top service!! Located near Psarou Beach (walking distance to hotspot Nammos). We stayed in a sea view standard room on the third floor, great balcony and very spacious room overlooking the pool. The bus into Mykonos Town takes about 10 minutes and stops right in front of the hotel. We rented an ATV to get around to the beaches during the day, this was arranged by the hotel concierge-- would highly recommend this hotel!",0
"At the buffet breakfast the availabily of a large choice of gluten free options made staying at the Paladium a pleasure for us. All the staff were very aware of the importance observing a gluten free diet for coeliacs. We were even given GF goodies for the return flight. The starlit pool is stunning. The staff really go that exrta mile to ensure that you are happy. We will return.   Room Tip: Rooms on the first floor (the floors are numbered in reverse order, so this the top floor) have the...

"Wow what a mistake I made booking this hotel !It all started when we checked in we were greeted by the manager Thannos , who is similar to a slimy used car salesman in the Bronx. Just a terrible feeling from his immediate initial greeting . Aggressive and pushy , you were immediately feeling like you had to be on guard. Not only me who noticed , my kids and wife all shared the same feeling. The whole place did not have the same feelings as the pictures. It felt empty and deserted , people did not seem to be happy. Two of the staff complained about the management shortly after our arrival. The pool area was empty with no one on duty. The the room felt very small and cold It was stocked with very little amenities. We asked for soap and shampoo every day , the Kleenex box had only 2 tissue left. We had to constantly ask extra towels as we were 4 in the room. All evenings we asked for turndown service , but it only happened 1 night. The closest beach is 200M away ...... In normal circumstances it would take 3 to 4 minute walk. Well that is surely not the case ! If you were an avid rock climber or hiker wearing proper gear this would take you 7-9 minutes. Beware if you are elderly or under 10 years old , as going to the beach is a dangerous option !!!!! Generally the staff was rude and had attitude , except for a few ... Stavros was great , he really went out of his way to make you feel welcomed as he was like a great ambassador to Greece , always ready to genuinely help. The breakfast at the hotel was the best thing. It was surely the best on the island. With lots of variety and everything was fresh and clean. The 3rd evening was the icing on the cake. There was a terrible noise started about 2 AM from the pipes in the bathroom. It woke us both. I tried running the water , flushing and even turn on the shower in hoping this would stop the noise.....I was unlucky as the noise did not subside. I put on a robe and went outside around the room , hoping to find a solution or shut off the water coming to the room. Nothing !I went to reception and told the man on duty the issue. I suggested to climb the roof as there could be pipes or valves that can cause the noise. His reply was that there is nothing he can do and we would have to wait until the staff arrives early morning. I returned to the room and my wife and I attempted to go back to bed with a pillow over our heads. Needless to write , this was a sleepless and frustrating evening. In the early morning I went to reception to find our greasy manager Thannos. I had him come to the room and listen to the noise. His answer was , I do not know where the noise is coming from. He mentioned the good news was that we were to switch rooms that evening as our room was for 3 nights only and we were being moved to a different category room. We explained what a terrible night we had and he had NO compassion and did not admit any guilt or express an excuse on behalf of the hotel. As a matter of fact , he said if it would had rained hard it would have been noisy as well and we would have had a head time sleeping. I let him know how upset I was and wanted to know how and what he would do to compensate us for an evening without sleep. We moved rooms the next evening , and had no noise. Upon check out I felt and expressed that wee were to be reimbursed for the evening of no sleep. There answer was , we stayed in the room that evening and there was to be NOTHING they were ready to do !Sorry to write this , but Thannos and his management and staff are total scum !To summarize, DO NOT STAY AT THE PALLADIUM HOTEL !!!!!",4
"A welcome return after a 3 year gap to the Palladium Hotel. First off, the whole booking process was so good dealing with Elena and Helene.. makes you feel like you're very welcome.Ive stayed in lots of lots of shiny, expensive hotels but the ones that really stick out are the ones where people treat you like friends. And they do here.. its just the way they are.Fabulous room on 1st floor with lovely views over the now remodelled and superb new swimming pool. A lovely touch the star lights in the pool floor that twinkle at night.. The rooms have been updated and now a hint more modern.. all very white and calm and luxurious. Extra (and now fluffy) towels always appear when you ask for them and while I sit drinking my very special coffee ;) on the terrace I feel very happy with being there. The craziness that is Mykonos in the Summer is perfectly counterbalanced with the white calm, cool breezes, upscale guests and peacefulness that is the Palladium. [I'll add this is not really a family hotel.. its seems to work best without kids running around everywhere and isn't really geared to them.]I like to swim early.. and I've worked out how to get pool towels that are not usually available til after 10 am at the pool - just ask at reception where they keep a supply for those early swimmers -- its taken me 5 years to work this out! So now you know!So, on to the people who make it so wonderful and special; the driver at the airport who zipped me to a late dinner on the day I arrived... thank you -- then to the very capable, professional and on it Thanos who has stepped up to be the go to man at the hotel. The very lovely Katerina who appears at breakfast and then later as the Conciege we love you; Hora and Elean, classy and charming, sharp and efficient and took care of all our every changing reservations (thank you) -- then to the legend that is Stavros -- this man is an icon and I almost go back just to see his ever smiling face and wonderful approach to life.Finally, the glossy Helene -- now being groomed to take over running the ship.. you are as charming as beautiful. And all of this quietly and serenely steered and guide by the the Queen herself, Stavroula. Thank you for making such a beautiful, classy, calm and special place.Make an effort to know these people and all of this is will happen.. I just work on the basis of what you put in, you get out. Lovely people, great place. I will return.   Room Tip: First and second floor pool views out to sea See more room tips",1
"This hotel was a strange mixture. Hotel's restaurant, public rooms and pool excellent. Service great. But hotel bedroom bizarre. So minimalist, nowhere to sit down. Everything white. When we arrived, no door on the shower which was like being on stage. Later got plastic shower curtain. We had paid extra for a private pool which was a virtual (and quite deep) tank, albeit pure white. Hard plastic loungers are too uncomfortable to sit on outside room. Eventually given lounge cushions. Lovely people. Amazing breakfast buffet - one of best we have ever had. Ask for a room in the main hotel with a balcony.",1
"My family was pleasantly surprised upon arrival at the Hotel Palladium. The pictures did not do enough justification to this clean and great looking hotel. We had the room with the private pool and it was awesome. Wait till you walk by the main swimming pool in the night and you will be mesmerised by the lights in the water. The staff's service level is top notch. They were attentive, friendly and you can tell they placed lots of emphasis in that area. The buffet breakfast offered a wide variety of food and were quickly replenished when it ran out. Overall, great experience and my family loves the place.",0
"Great hotel, excellent service.They have a great pool, great rooms, great people.If I come back to Mykonos I will absolutely stay here again.The food it's really great, specially the chicken nuggets and the pizza.Great experience being here",0
"The best hotel in Mykonos.Excellent service, location and ammenities.All the crew are amazing.We have a junior suite and is a great very spacious room.I recommend this hotel to all the people from all the ages.Also very good food 24 hours",0
"I just spent a week in Mykonos and two nights in the Palladium Hotel. The Wifi is fast and the location is great - waking distance to the beach and many good restaurants and also mini marts.My experience at the Palladium was truly wonderful. Right from check in we were greeted by Hara who was very friendly and easy going, and gave great recommendations about places to visit and eat, as well as arranging our airport transfers. She was truly keeping up with all the smallest details and needs of our stay.I booked our stay via Expedia as the hotel is part of the +VIP Access collection. Being gold members with the programme, we were really surprised that the hotel recognised our membership status (unlike many other +VIP Access hotels.Shortly after check in, we were escorted by Thanos who was the most enthusiastic and helpful hotel staff we’ve came across, giving us a very lively tour of the hotel as well as efficiently assisting with our luggages. We spent two nights in the Suite with Private Pool which are new and very well designed. All I can say is that the suite was utter bliss. Although the room faces the hills and not directly at the sea, having the private pool and terrace is extremely convenient. The suites are isolated from the rest of the hotel, giving you a lot of privacy. But it’s also really convenient as everything you need is within reach of your own suite. We really enjoyed the privacy of being able to tan and swim unclothed. In the night the pool is illuminated, creating a relaxing ambiance that you can also enjoy from within your room.That said the hotel grounds are perfectly maintained and very well designed. The drinks at the pool bar were also surprisingly not overpriced. Dionysus at the pool bar was also very friendly and served up wonderful cocktails.Overall I’m really sad to leave Mykonos and the Palladium Hotel. We are already thinking about our next trip to the Palladium. Thanks for making our stay a wonderful one",1
"If you're looking for a boutique hotel with great service and good amenities, this is your hotel! We booked our trip last minute and were lucky to find availability at this hotel. We spent most our time at beach clubs but the time we spent in the pool and at the hotel, we had excellent service. It also has a great location! Thanos at the hotel was very helpful in giving us suggestions and also arranging transportation for us. Getting around Mykonos is very difficult so if your hotel can provide you with a driver or help you with this- take it! it's very helpful. Also, if you decide to stay here- ask for Thanos- he is excellent and will go above and beyond to help you have a great trip. Overall, we had a great experience at Hotel Palladium.",1
"We loved our stay at Palladium. The hotel was clean, cute, and conveniently located right next to Psauro Beach – perfect for our first trip to Mykonos. The staff was wonderful, helping us with some unrelated travel issues, transportation around the island (cabs are not plentiful), rides to/from the airport, and general tips. Thanos in particular went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was perfect. The pool was lovely and relaxing with tons of sunlight.",0
"Excellent hotel and service. All the people treat you perfect....................... The food excellent, the pool with a beautiful view, very clean place and all the staff is very polite. Ask for thanos and he will help with all that you need is the best....",0
"The hotel is amazing and the people is great! The best hotel in Mykonos by far. You feel like home.The service is exceptional, they do everything they can to make your stay an incredible experience that you will certainly want to repeat.Ask got Thanos, he is the best!",1
"Just returned from a vacation there. It is a nice and clean and well-maintained hotel. It's nothing spectacular but it serves the purpose in a comfortable fashion. The staff is extraordinary and extremely helpful and outgoing. The hotel grounds are well-maintained.Their transfer from the airport and to the ship port via the hotel van was also very nice.Breakfast downstairs was very average. I would even go as far to say it is somewhat mediocre. But with breakfast included, I won't complain too much.A heated pool and one or two heated Jacuzzi's outside near the pool area would be nice. Having better transportation via the hotel to take Guest to Mykonos town and other popular beaches would be nice. Getting a taxi or rental on the island was very difficult.Hotel itself was very quiet and peaceful at night. It also has a gym which is an added bonus. Once again, the staff are extraordinary. Kudos to all of them for excellent customer service.",0
"A beautiful boutique hotel, in the heart of Platis Yialos and short walk to Psarou Beach. The hotel had a very warm and happy feel. The staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome and at home from the minute we arrived. Our 2 year old was traveling with us and the staff were very accommodating to all our requests. The room itself was fresh, modern and the king size bed and air conditioning heaven. The pool area was fantastic and the pool side service great. The hotel buffet breakfast was divine with great variety. Plenty of parking on the premises for our rented car. The hotel shuttle service to and from the port/airport is extra handy as taxis in the area are limited and few. Overall, a great hotel and we will definitely stay again.",0
"The hotel is nice, typical white building, good decoration. Rooms are ok, but for a 5stars hotel the facilities, conservation and services are quite limited. There are 3 top class things to highlight, breakfast, super! The pool area, that has been renovated recently, and the staff, always there at your service. I'd rated this hotel with 4 stars due to rooms and services. Rooms need to be renovated and also bathrooms where rusty taps and pipes make them out of the standard. Minibar is so limited, and decoration need to be improved. We tried to use gym, but most of the facilities didn't work. Please, avoid if you can 4th floor, too noisy as it is by the pool and children and teens never stop shouting and specially about 404 right in front of the laundry and you can listen to Washing machines all night long. I came here with that high expectations as I was looking for a boutique and top class hotel but I found a good hotel where people shout, in front of the laundry room... There is free of charge wifi, but is quite slow... The distance to the beach is about 10 min walking.   Room Tip: Ask for sea view rooms on the 1st floor which is the highest floor See more room tips",2
"We spent a few nights at this beautiful hotel, following a wedding in Tinos. What we were looking for was a bit of luxury and ultimate relaxation - we couldn't have chosen a better option. They offer a free transfer from the airport and port, and when you arrive, you are truly looked after. The rooms almost all overlook the pool with slight sea views. We opted for a standard room and it was small but more than fine for us, as we didn't spend much time in it. Everything is very modern and spotlessly clean. The staff are also so helpful and can't do enough for you. The food both by the pool and the breakfast is amazing - lots of choice, great quality and service always with a smile. Pool bar staff are also very attentive and drinks are reasonable too. Location wise, the hotel is set alone and whilst there are a few restaurants and beaches nearby, you do need to be able to walk a fair distance (15-20 mins). Either along the road (downhill there, uphill back) or down some pretty steep steps. Whilst it was fine for us, others may struggle so it's worth pointing out. Mykonos Town is about a 5-10 minute drive away, the hotel offers transfers (although prices are steep @ €60 return) or there is a local bus/coach that runs every 30 minutes and was pretty reliable. The bus also runs until about 3am for those that want to party. Taxis on the island are very difficult to get hold of as they are very limited. We would certainly return to the Palladium Hotel if we find ourselves in Mykonos again. Would highly recommend.",0
"This was my first time to Mykonos so I was a little apprehensive about booking outside of the town itself.The hotel itself is beautiful and clean. All of the team there make you feel so welcome and as it is a boutique hotel, there is that personal touch of recognising you each day which was lovely. Irini and Demetrius (I think) in particular stood out for us as they were so warm and friendly at breakfast and remembered the drinks we liked to have with breakfast. The guy with glasses was so funny too, he made me laugh every day and we even saw him out on a few nights out which is just typical of how friendly Mykonos is!Speaking of breakfast, it was world class. Brilliant selection and tasted beautiful.My room, 108 was brilliant, spacious and the balcony was the highest so I felt like royalty standing out on it with such an impeccable view of Platys Gialos.The room service, was again quick and the food superb. The television choice wasn't great in English to be honest we literally had a few shows a day. However, I expect that when on Greek Islands so no big loss.Internet was superb, probably the best I've encountered on a small island!The location was a bit odd as you are on a main road about 10 minutes walk to the coast/restaurants but right next to a bus stop to the coast or Mykonos town (10 minutes away).Thank you for another lovely stay between Mykonos and Santorini, I think I've experienced some of the best hospitality in my life!   Room Tip: Room 108 (mine) seemed to have the biggest and highest balcony with nothing to your left side! See more room tips",0
"I will ensure to be very fair when I write this review. The staff are fantastic, and do everything they can to make your stay great. Especially Thanos, Dimitiris and Stavros.The pool area is great and the views from the balcony rooms were nice. Location was fantastic also - we used quads to get around very easily.The negatives are due to the price they are asking for. Maybe it is the norm in Mykonos during high season, but for approx 550 euros per night - we expected a bit more. I've stayed in many hotels for a lower price which were truly 5 star - I felt this hotel is more like a 3 or 4 star hotel, although with 5 star service.Negatives: Unfortunately a foul smell in the rooms when the taps were turned on. Air-conditioners are loud and out-dated, rooms are tiled and simple given the price.",1
"The staff at Palladium will help you out with everything you need, in particular Thanos. He will arrange everything and make sure you are in good hands. In Mykonos it is always best to stay at a Hotel for security reasons and Palladium Hotel is a really good hotel compared to the other hotels in Mykonos.",0
Really beautiful hotel close to the beach.Beautiful pool .Lovely bedrooms.Unfortunately we only had one night before leaving Mykonos so really didn't get the true feel.Left early and couldn't get breakfast.,0
"Not only is Mykonos a dream in itself, our stay at Hotel Palladium took it to a new level of wonderful. We stayed here in July 2016. Having a private driver waiting for us at the airport upon arrival, and then taking us to the hotel only to be greeted by the friendliest staff anyone could ask for. We had our own private balcony, with a private jacuzzi. Thanos especially, made sure our stay was everything we could have dreamed of. Anything you wanted, and the staff at this hotel would make it happen for you. This hotel offered something for everyone: families with small children, couples or groups of friends. This hotel was so close to the beach, had a beautifully renovated pool and pool area, easy bus access (for like 1 euro) to Mykonos Town, or to the clubs. This was by far the best hotel I have EVER stayed at, service and cleanliness (better than any other 5 star hotels/resorts we've stayed at). I would 100% recommend to a friend and I am counting down the days until I can go back to Hotel Palladium.   Room Tip: Lower level floors seem to have more privacy See more room tips",0
I have stayed at the Palladium hotel for last 3 consecutive years with my friends. Every year i have had an incredible time. The hotel is very well managed and the staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Especially Thanos who was very welcoming and always willing to offer recommendations of amazing places to go. Further the hotel is situated right by Psarou beach and Platys Gialos Beach . I really found the location superb as it was right by my favorite restaurant Nammos which made everything even more convenient.I highly recommend this hotel.To next year,0
I stayed at the Palladium with a few friends in July and it was an amazing experience! The staff was very accommodating and friendly - and helped us with everything we needed. The service was amazing and the food was delicious (especially the breakfast with do it yourself orange and grapefruit juice machines. I'm definitely coming back next year!,0
"We first stayed at Hotel Palladium in 2015 for 1 week and had such an incredible experience that we decided to come back again in July 2016. Every aspect of the hotel, from the staff to the food, is catered to ensure that the guests have a comfortable stay. The staff is incredibly friendly and are willing to help with anything - especially Thanos, who took care of us throughout our stay and made sure we were comfortable.This is definitely one of our favourite hotels and we will continue to come back every year.",0
This a great hotel near the beach. The breakfast is amazing!!! So much to choose from and it is included with your room rate. Service was very good and the hotel shuttle picked us up from the airport. The room was a tad small and off to the back. Also the front door of our room did not fully close which caused the wind to come through all night. Overall it was a great stay.,0
"Palladium is a small buttick hotel near Namos beach, who offers great service, beautiful and clean rooms, good food, but above all the best staff a hotel can have - they helped us with everything - where to go, how, when.. And always with so much patient and great attitude. The atmosphere is very intimate and personal. I went back after 3 years and Thanos recognized me, it felt great :)",0
"An Mykonos.amazing boutique hotel in a great location just off the beautiful Psarou beach in From the minute I walked in with my friends, we were welcomed and looked after. The hotel is nicely styled and has a contemporary feel. We spent 5 nights at Hotel Palladium and the staff always greeted us warmly and were there to help whenever we needed anything - nothing was too much trouble and they even went out of their way to help and ensure we had a comfortable and enjoyable holiday, especially Mr. Thanos Grigoropoulos . The rooms are a good size, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and highly recommended - we enjoyed it very much.The hotel is ideal for a holiday with excellent facilities.Overall, we highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again when we next visit Mykonos.",0
"Third visit in June and everything beyond good as usual.Stavros & Thanos continue to excel & all the new staff are maintaining Palladium's customary highest standards.So good, in fact, that we are returning in September.",0
"What an amazing stay! My friend and I stayed here for two days in our trip through Greece. We booked the basic room with a garden view and ended up getting so much more! Upon arrival, we were given champagne and fresh towels. Thanos, the manager, immediately upgraded us to a room that is not on the website with a private patio, sun beds, and pool! We were able to stay in the upgraded room both nights and it was so big and beautiful! The service was incredible - everything we needed Thanos went above and beyond to help us with - from recommendations for dinner / going out, to arranging private transfer for us, to meeting us outside the hotel in Mykonos town to help us get a taxi home (it is extremely difficult to get a taxi at night there). The room service food and wine options were delicious and really well priced for how nice the hotel was! There was even a 24-hour menu for when we came back to the hotel around 4 am! The breakfast buffet was insane - there was everything from traditional Greek breakfast to an omelette bar, to unlimited mimosas. The hotel pool was also very nice and beautiful at night. We could not have been happier with our stay and cannot wait to come back! Thank you so much!!!!",1
"Stayed and fell in love with the hotel, food was excellent and the hotel was everything you could want, clean, tidy and welcoming. Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough for you. We would recommend this hotel to everyone.",2
"Truly can't say anything bad about this hotel. The service, the guests, the rooms, the view, the area, the food, everything was incredible. I have never been to a hotel where the staff gets to know as well as the staff here did. They were extremely helpful with everything. They gave the best dinner and lunch recommendations, they helped my friends and I navigate Mykonos, and they also checked made sure our stay would be nothing but excellent. The rooms were beautiful with an amazing view. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, the bathrooms were spotless, and there was a lot of room for all of our things. The guests at the hotel were of all ages. Overall, my experience here was nothing short of amazing.",0
"A beautiful hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Mykonos town with two beaches in really close proximity. Our standard double room was spacious with everything provided for and direct access to the glorious pool. The rooms are kept really clean with a twice daily maid service. The stars of this hotel are the staff, and I genuinely mean ALL of the staff. Every member of the team made us so welcome and went out of their way to ensure we had a wonderful holiday. The staff were really friendly and chatted whenever they could to get to know us. Thank you to all of the staff you really are the best. The food at the hotel carries on in the same high standard way. Breakfast is so generous and plentiful, probably the best selection I've ever seen. The restaurant and pool bar also serve wonderful food. Don't hesitate on staying here, you really Won't be dissappointed.",0
"Beautiful hotel just ten minutes walk from the beach which is a positive rather than a negative as this gives just that extra bit of peace and quiet.The staff are wonderful, all very helpful and friendly especially at breakfast which is a vast array of foodstuffs-never seen anything like it.Lovely, large swimming pool with nice bar.The only thing that wasn't great was our bathroom which was very small and not very well designed.We'd definitely stay there again.",1
Hotel Palladium is fantastic. It is situated perfectly between the beaches and downtown and has a great greek atmosphere. The rooms were amazing and staff very helpful. Ask for Thanos when you arrive. He is always there to answer your questions or make your wishes come true. He's the reason our hotel stay was perfect.,0
"Myself and some friends had the pleasure of staying here last week. From the moment we checked in the hotel, the staff was supper accommodating especially with all the demands me and my large party had. Service was always above and beyond from organizing car services to setting up reservations for us. Everyone was exceptionally nice, especially our man Thanos, who was always available to help. The location was also amazing, less than a 10 minute walk from the Psarou beach and Nammos. Definitely going back to this hotel the next time I'm able to visit Mykonos!",0
"The Palladium Hotel was an impulse booking having seen it on the Great Escapes email. We had previously enjoyed a holiday on Mykonos but weren't planning to return as there are so many other great places to visit. However, it turned out to be a good decision as the hotel and staff were superb and we had an excellent week. A special mention must go to Stavros and his assistant Marious who made the stay even more enjoyable. Stavros is not only an excellent restaurant manager he is a wealth of knowledge about the island and much more and It was always a pleasure chatting to him. The hotel itself is very clean, the rooms are good, the food is excellent and it's location is close to Mykonos Town with a regular bus service. The local beaches during the high season are very busy and beds are packed close together - not to mention the cost of hiring them! The pool at the hotel on the other hand was far more comfortable and if you hire a car you're able to go to quieter areas around the island. All in all we would definitely recommend Mykonos and this hotel.   Room Tip: Higher floors have an ocean view See more room tips",0
Very pleasant stay and great service: bedroom with the sea views terrace and the nice staff are the best of this charming hotel boutique!Very good location: walking distance from the beach (Psarou) and 10 min drive to Mykonos town for nice dinners and evening walks.Hope to come back soon!,0
"The Palladium Hotel in Mykonos was the first stop on our Greek island honeymoon tour and it definitely set the bar HIGH for all of our following hotels! From the second we walked through the door, we could feel how amazing the hotel was going to be. We first met Hara, who was incredibly sweet, knowledgeable and absolutely amazing! She continued to help us with things throughout our too short stay. In addition, Thanos was incredibly friendly and helpful! The daily breakfast is awesome with many delicious options! Our room was beautiful and had a gorgeous view! The location is great! A short walk to the beach, but far enough away so that you get some peace and quiet. Everything was absolutely perfect about this hotel! Thank you for the wonderful memories! :)",0
"The staff at this boutique hotel are consistently enthusiastic and eager to make one's stay perfect and memorable. The location is great - less than 10 min drive to Mykonos town, a 5 min walk to Platys Gialos and Psarou Beaches. Restaurants were equally amazing and breakfast had incredible selection of foods and beverages.",0
"Hotel Palladium, is simply a great place to stay, while enjoying your time in Mykonos. From the great service and support from the staff to the ravishing cinematic view from the hotel grounds. Palladium is most definitely should definitely fall unto the list of the the hotels, absolutely fantastic for first timers like myself on the island. Upon arrival you are instantly given a warm welcome and a toast to celebrate the beginning of an unforgettable time. The 24 hour service is a reassuringly a much appreciated bonus, the staff is happy to oblige, no matter the time of day. No matter how you feel, they always seems to appear cheerful and encouraging to try new things and provide any necessary information, as well as give insightful pointers. When leaving you will most definitely at least consider coming back to make experience whatever you missed out the last time. Finally, one staff member stands out the most. Happy to answer and help at anytime, the hotel's guest manager Thanos has definitely stood out the most from the staff. From the moment of my arrival to the point of my departure Thanos did not disappoint once and I am really grateful to have met such a diligent and astute person. All in all, Palladium was a great time and a great stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that plans to visit Mykonos. Overall a great experience",2
"Great location right near the beach. You can walk not even 5 minutes to Psarou beach. About 10 minutes drive to the town (one downfall; taxi prices are high in Mykonos no matter where you go. I didn't see any metered taxis while there so they charge whatever they feel like charging) besides the taxi situation, Service was impeccable at this hotel . All staff is very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. Large variety of breakfast buffet selections. Omelet guy in the morning makes a tasty Omelet, Vladimirous was attentive and the entire wait staff were hospitable. Thanos was amazing and front desk check in was informative.",2
"Coming from a horrible flight experience with Volotea Airline (DON'T EVER FLY WITH THEM), all we really wanted to do was get to our hotel and rest. But we didn't expect to arrive into one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. We were welcomed by the most amazing staff with such amazing customer service skills. We originally booked a double room with a private pool, but got a complimentary upgrade to, I believe, a superior suite with a private pool. The room was beyond amazing and one of the staff, Thanos, was so welcoming and helped us get settled into our room. Breakfast in the morning was always great. They had a good variety of food and there was always something new, unlike other hotels that serve the same thing everyday. Sad thing is we only stayed 2 nights and one of the days got cut short because of our super delayed flight. We definitely plan on coming back!Special thanks to Thanos, he's seriously your go-to guy, just plain awesome!! I'm sad that we didn't get to know the other staff members because of the time constraint, but every staff member we came across from the front desk to the breakfast area were all so nice and friendly. This hotel has definitely exceeded my expectations in every way possible.. definitely a 5 star hotel. Nothing else can compare.",0
"I stayed here on a solo holiday and, must say, it was absolutely amazing. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are extremely accommodating and helpful. Particular thanks to Thanos and Stravos for making my stay enjoyable. The food is also truly amazing. The best hotel by far during my 2 week island-hopping Greek holiday.",1
"We spent a fantastic week at this hotelLocation, service, food, excellentAll the staff were very helpful and polite The hotel is very clean and well presentedThe only small criticism for a 5 star hotel better changing facilities are required if you have a late flight and have already checked out   Room Tip: Rooms over the pool or to the side of the hotel good See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a wonderful time! The hotel is stunning, with luxurious rooms, a breathtaking view and very courteous staff! The one thing that definitely stood our for us was the hospitality, made us feel at home! Definitely recommend it!",0
"We were at the palladium hotel this time last week and now have a serious dose of the holiday blues. This was our fifth visit to the Palladium and it just keeps getting better and better.From arrival at the airport and having the friendly driver Stathis waiting to whisk us to the hotel, checking in with a glass of bubbly and a nice cool face cloth, Thanos collecting our luggage and taking us to our room, the way we are welcomed makes you feel special. The breakfast is the best we have ever experienced abroad and I defy anyone to be disappointed with the choice available. Now to mention the best thing about this hotel, The STAFF as many reviews have also said, they really are amazing. With too many to mention by name but you all made our visit special from the wonderful fleet of maids that keep the hotel spotless in every aspect to all the others that work very hard but always have a smile on there face. The wonderful Stavros who controls breakfast and is the host in the restaraunt on an evening has become a good friend and his new helper Marious and the new chef are great additions to the team, as is Demtris at the bar who's cocktails are a must to try. We miss you all and want to say again thank you for a great holiday. Bev and Carl x",0
This is a great hotel with very nice service. Good location only a 5 minute walk to the beach. The front desk was very helpful with recommendations and reservations. The pool was lovely and plenty of room. The breakfast was spectacular. Good choice and good value.,0
"This is a beautiful boutique with out of the world hospitality. A special thanks to Thanos and Gerti who took such great care of us! The hotel rooms are stunning. Also, the view of the hotels swimming pool at night is breathtaking! Will definitely visit again!",0
"We stayed here for a week in May and had a lovely time. The hotel is so luxurious. Gorgeous views from the restaraunt out onto the sea, amazing food for breakfast and dinner. The pancake chef makes you fresh pancakes which are perfect. It's about 5 minutes bus into Mykonos town and there are 3 beaches from the hotel that are walking distance. Quite small beaches but good sea for snorkelling! The staff are so hardworking and friendly, they make you feel at home and help in every way! Definitely recommend!",1
"Amasing place in a beautiful island!People in the hotel make you feel really warm! Really nice acomodation, grat food...really an amasing experienceThis is a place everybody mut visit on Mikonos!!!!",0
"My boyfriend and I thought we should have a weekend away and we decided on Mykonos. I have been many times before and I have stayed once before at the Palladium. This time and the previous time I had used Secret Escapes to book this hotel. The first time back in July 2013 it was sheer bliss :) So I knew from the start this hotel was going to be the best choice. Not only were we extremely happy but the experience exceeded all expectations.The price was amazing for the value and it included transfers, welcome beverage with a warm towel to freshen you up and breakfast and dinner. To our luck we were even upgraded to a junior suite which was beautiful.The staff just to name a few: Chara, Eleni, Thanos, Stavros, Dionysus etc were extremely polite, accommodating and were a pleasure to meet. I have never been to a hotel with such service, such hospitality and kindness. This hotel is beautiful and cosy, the food is delicious, prices are extremely reasonable but I find what made this experience amazing was the staff. Everywhere we visited in Mykonos the people were fun and hospitable but the staff at the Palladium define that word hospitality.Its in a great location, only a 5-10 minute walk and about a 10 - 15min drive to Mykonos Town. Apparently there are only 30 taxis on the island but there is a regular bus outside the hotel that takes you to the town. I very much recommend renting a quad as they are fun to drive and you get to go around the whole island. My boyfriend and I are already planning our next trip.",1
"We have just returned from 10 days at this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived and Thanos greated us with all the front of house staff we knew we had made the right decision.Stavros is often mentioned in reviews and he deserves every compliment he recieves he is always charming and helpful whatever the time of the day.The wonderful Dion who runs the pool bar never stops, always looking and making sure everything is in order.Dimitris makes the most amazing cocktails and is there before you go out and when you return with a wonderful night cap.You where made to feel welcome and part of the family. The lovely owner is always about I am not sure any of them gets to sleep.The rooms a lovely all slightly different and always clean and well looked after by the staff.The hotel is in a great location and you can walk down the hill to the beach and wonderful restaurants or get the bus into Mykonos - this is a great town to wonderf round.If you dont want to move from the hotel then try the food in the evenings in the restaurant it is perfect and the view is breathtaking.We hope to return and hope anyone reading this review books this hotel and Island for a really special holiday.",1
"Excellent hotel is not situated in the center but it's not a problem. We can have a rest and for enjoying the lifestyle of Mykonos is only 10 minutes driving from the city center, even from the trendy Mykonos beaches.Very nice welcoming, professional staff and friendly in all the department. Reception always smiling, breakfast staff always taking care of you with smile and nice words. I ready do recommended the hotel Palladium.",0
"My friend and I stayed here in June this year. WE were not happy with our room and so were given a room overlooking the pool which was perfect. We had our late meal in the hotel, and were served by Stavros (great guy). Breakfast can be taken on the terrace but we opted to be inside as it was already hot. Breakfast is an amazing start to the day, everything you could wish for. We decided to stay by the pool the first day, which is beautifully laid out, plenty of towels and beds, no messing with deposits and one back to get another. Great food by the pool if you want it in a nice shaded area, or by your beds. All the staff were excellent all week and we could not fault anything, As the hotel is at the top of the hill your own transport is an advantage, but the bus stops outside the hotel, they can get rather full as Greek buses do. I hope to return one day, wish it was now.",0
"My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights in June this year. From the start of the trip where we were greeted by the transfer at the airport we knew we had picked a very good hotel and it just got better and better. We arrived at the hotel with a glass of prosecco, staff were so friendly, attentive. the breakfast every morning was to die for, so much choice and Stavros made us laugh every day with his jokes. The room was beautiful and we had the most amazing balcony overlooking the pool. We really enjoyed the evenings with Dimitrous where he would make us cocktails and tell us stories. The variety of restaurants and bars down the harbour were great, we would have to recommend Blue Myth for the Greek Night. Mykonos town was beautiful and so much to do whether you wanted to eat/drink or go for a dance. Thank you Thannos for everything.",0
Stayed here for a week in June with my mum for our second year at the hotel and once again couldn't fault anything. Breakfast is one of the most extensive I have ever come across and of such high quality which is also true of the hotel restaurant which we dined in on a couple of nights and had exceptional meals on both occasions. What really makes this hotel stand out however is the staff who are all so welcoming and nothing is too much for any of them. In particular Thanos and Stavros really went out of their way to ensure we had a perfect stay in Mykonos and we are all ready looking at booking to come back next summer.,0
"On our recent visit to Mykonos, our fifth to the island, we decided as we had stayed previously at The Palladium on all occasions that we would try somewhere different as we thought with a few staff changes that it may not have the same ambiance, but how we were wrong! On arrival at our new hotel, although newly refurbished and lovely people, there was something missing, that special element that the Palladium has in abundance. It was late in the evening, but we managed to locate Thanos at The Palladium, who liaised with the owners and forty minutes later we had been collected and happily re-settled back in what should have been our first choice hotel. Each year the hotel owners have always reinvested and this year was no exception, a newly created large swimming pool and fab new loungers plus further rooms with private pools all perfect for that discerning stay.This was definitely fifth time lucky, the new staff complement the existing team perfectly and the whole operation is so personal and being in the industry ourselves, we recognise how all the staff genuinely love the hotel and it reflects in their never waning diligence and always delivered with a smile. Thanos is the star his commitment to the family and hotel is exemplary. Stavros, the restaurant manager, is a true gent and a great professional and exceeds customer expectations. Dimitris, the new cocktail barman, has certainly raised the ‘bar’ superb cocktails delivered with a disarming and lovely sense of humour, we certainly miss our bantering. Every staff member from the maintenance team, Stathis the driver, Dion at pool bar, housekeeping and reception all equally pay a crucial part.In summary, we are lucky to travel extensively and stay in some memorable hotels, but The Palladium should be on your bucket list and not to be missed if you visit the amazing island of Mykonos. A big thank to everyone at the Palladium, you have a great formula and we hope to visit our ‘first choice hotel in Mykonos’ again very soon x",1
"This place was unreal!! The staff made us feel like a top priority, and they were all very nice and helpful. Our accommodations were upgraded to a better room at no cost which had a view that was incredible. The scene from our balcony captured the lovely pool space and Platis Yialos beach in the backdrop. Breakfast was the most luxurious buffet I've attended and as a great way to start the day. The staff was the real treat and I would highly recommended this wonderful hotel. Thanos was always there for us, Hara helped with planning our trip and Dimitris makes a killer drink!   Room Tip: Many great rooms: pool view, expanded balconies or direct pool access. All seemed good See more room tips",0
"It really does live up to its 5 star reputation - one of the best hotels for service, quality and cleanliness. Friendly and helpful staff willing to go above and beyond for every need and look after you so well. We've enjoyed the beautifully renovated pool and pool bar and also the restaurant in the evening overlooking the sea and pool. Cleaning staff clean your room twice a day meaning your room is always beautiful. Food and drinks are excellent - make sure you book at least one evening meal here. Look out for the friendly waiting staff (especially Stavros!) and make sure you book for a really excellent and worthwhile break. No faults at all!",0
"From the moment we arrived in Mykonos, we knew we were in for a special experience with the Palladium Hotel. From the friendly and fast transfer from the airport to the warm welcome we received from Thanos and Kristina at the hotel, we felt instantly relaxed and pampered. The location is perfect-- it's a short walk to Platys Gialos and Psarou beaches and if you want to go into town, the bus stops right in front of the hotel and will have you there in 10 minutes or less. We loved that the hotel was small and therefore you felt the sincere personal interest from the staff each day in a very friendly but unobtrusive way. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and clean with individual air conditioning and free wifi.As has been stated by others, the breakfast buffet is truly outstanding with options for everyone. We stayed on the half board option so also enjoyed delicious 3-course dinners each evening in the elegant restaurant with sea views. No review would be complete without mentioning the amazing Stavros and the hard work he does to make the guests dining experience memorable and enjoyable. We cannot recommend the Palladium enough...this hotel has it all....Beautiful facility, perfect location and excellent staff.",1
"We would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is excellent, just a short drive by public transport (bus stop in front of the hotel) and a close walk to the beach.Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable, although not very spacious. We were very impressed by the staff: they all were very helpful, service-minded and extremely polite.Breakfast was just superb with a rich choice of breads, fruits, cheese and sausages, omelets and yoghurt, excellent stuff.If we choose to return to Mykonos, we will definitely stay in the Palladium.",0
"This hotel combines everything you could wish for in a perfect holiday. From the moment you arrive the genuine friendliness of all the staff is matched only by their desire to ensure you have the best possible stay. Comfortable airy rooms with air conditioning, a truly remarkable international breakfast buffet sets you up for a 5 minute stroll to the nearby Gialos Beach or just to sit on luxury sun beds by the hotel pool with its own bar. We travelled half board and enjoyed superb 3 course dinners from an extensive and delicious menu, looked after by Stavros, the diamond in the Palladium crown! With Mykanos town a 10 minute bus ride away, this is a hotel that offers everything and then a whole lot more!",0
"This hotel aims to please. From the moment we arrived until we left the staff were so genuinely friendly and helpful. They made recommendations and reservations for each day and night...service, service, service. The location is fantastic. We didnt rent any vehicles, rather walked to the beaches (only a few minutes walk), and the bus stop for mykonos town is right in front of the hotel entrance. The rooms are gorgeous and so comfortable. Amenities were fantastic. Breakfast was delicious. Truly enjoyed our visit!",0
"Amazing hotel, beautiful location, great rooms, delicious food, wonderful and friendly staff:Thanos will do everything with in his power to make your vacation perfect.Chara will arange you all that you wish.Stathis will give you the feeling of a good old friend from the second you meet him (and he knows all the best places to eat).Katerina will always welcome you with a big smile.And the entire staff is very warm and kind.Outstanding hotel",0
"Awesome hotel in an amazing location in mykonos. Just 50 meters from the best beach in mykonos you are set with the luxury pool the palladium provides and the stunning beaches that are walking distance. Thanos, an employee at the Palladium, will warmly welcome you with open arms and constantly be at your service throughout your stay. He will cater to your every and any need. It was our honeymoon and he greeted us with champagne and chocolate desserts. Can't recommend enough.   Room Tip: I like the rooms that overlook Mykonos town the beautiful white buildings as it is more private then... See more room tips",0
"My wife and I spent three wonderful days at the Palladium Hotel. As previous reviewers have noted the service was impeccable. We have stayed in many highly rated hotels and I was very impressed with the top notch service, yes Thanos, and all the service personnel. When we arrived we were upgraded to a top level suite with a magnificent view,,room 103. The breakfast was great and the best that we experienced in Greece. All in all a fantastic experience.",0
"Hotel Palladium was brilliant for a long weekend with friends. It exceeded expectations and everyone was so friendly and helpful. Going out of their way to make sure we had a good time. Ask for Thanos! He is fantastic and so welcoming. Definitely recommend The Palladium Hotel for all - great rooms and so close to the beaches and restaurants. The breakfasts were also the most amazing we have had, so much choice everyday. Looking forward to the next trip already.",2
"Amazing boutique hotel. Excellent location, close to great beaches and the town. Service was flawless and highly personalized, made us feel like home. The pool and restaurant were great. Couldn't have asked for more. Can't wait to come back again.",1
"Myself and my daughter visited this hotel for the second time on the 1/6/2016 for a week, yet again we had a fantastic time mainly because the staff are wonderful especially Stavros and Thanos everyone makes you so welcome here and nothing is too much trouble.The breakfast is extensive you can have whatever you want and the setting is relaxed and very comfortable.The menu in the restaurant for the evening was superb and of course you had Stavros to make recommendations and keep you entertained throughout your evening.I love this hotel and was sad to leave it, however have already got room rates for next June/July and will be booking again as soon as the flights are released.Thanks again to Stavros and Thanos for looking after us you are the best.",0
"After reading the reviews I was a little concerned that people were over selling the hotel. That was not the case! The entire hotel staff was helpful and polite. The breakfast would have probably cost 40€ per person out. It was quite an impressive spread. We had a room with a private pool. We had a hard time leaving it for the beach because it was so peaceful, close to the bar, and got wonderful sun. This entire stay was 5 star. I really cannot think of one thing to complain about!",0
"This place was well reviewed and it met all of our expectations and more!Great breakfast, service was awesome, Internet was fast, and concierge helped us with everything! The location was awesome and it was the best hotel of our honeymoon!I love writing these reviews because there is nothing but great things to say!",0
"This was a lovely hotel in a good location which was a short bus ride (10 mins) from the town centre.All the staff were very friendly,smiling at all times and very professional.The Room was very good and the housekeeping staff were excellent at their job.On some occasions we ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was excellent and the wine list was good.Breakfasts were also good and the waiting and serving staff were very attentive.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel experience and it has been both a pleasure and also easy to write this review.",0
I was there in October of 2014 for one week. the hotel is really beautiful and the rooms are spacious and bright. the hotel offers a nice bar and a good restaurant. however eating out is what you want to experience whilst in mykonos. the welcome was extremely warm and all the staff was very friendly and helpful. the pool and the pool bar give you the option to spend a lazy day at the hotel if you don't want to venture outside. there is a bus stop right outside the hotel and you can commute easy to mykonos town.,0
"We love this hotel! Not only is a beautiful hotel, with great suites, but it also has an amazing view to the island!The food is beyond perfect, and all the people who work there are really friendly and kind.The location is great, because is really near to the beach, and has all the basic staff you wil need nearby (mini market, bike rental, car rental, restaurantes, etc.).",1
"My husband and I stayed at the Palladium for 4 nights for our honeymoon. Everything was magnificent! The staff worked so well together to ensure that our stay was memorable and special. Thannos went above and beyond and ensured that we had the best of the best within the hotel and around Mykonos. His recommendations were of quality and helped make our stay pleasant. The pool, the buffet breakfast, and all amenities were just perfect! We will certainly return to this beautiful hotel with amicable and dedicated staff!",0
Amazing villas with so beautiful villa with prive swimming pool. We have champagne for welcome drink and a big plate for all summer fruits! So rich breakfast so delicious foods... Amazing landscape blue of Aegean! I have the most beautiful memories......,0
"The hotel and the facilities in general are very nice and well maintained. Good value for money. Nice design. Staff friendly. At the arrival since it was early and we were with a 2 years girl they gave us a bedroom where we rest until our room was ready, this has been a very good way to start our vacation. Also the bedroom and the view were simply amazing. I recommend this hotel",1
"We stayed at the Myconian Villa Collection in a spacious and well-appointed suite. First of all, Katerina and George were very warm and hospitable- they greeted us with smiles always, as did the staff throughout the hotel and restaurant, in general. George made very good recommendations, and was always friendly and energetic. Regarding the restaurant: The breakfast buffet offered a nice selection, and our dinner experience exceeded expectations! As far as our accommodations, we found the rooms to be well-kept, clean, and nicely decorated. We loved the private balcony with our own salt water pool! When we arrived after our long trip, we were happy to find an array of sliced fresh fruits and refreshments on the dining table to welcome us. I must add that the housekeeper, Maria, was very sweet, patient with our late-sleepers, and once able to, made every room in the suite clean and tidy. It's true the hotel was away from the town, but the shuttle helped make up for that. My family and I were very pleased and would recommend this hotel villa and its amenities in a heartbeat! Thank you to everyone at the Myconian Villas!",0
"This is by far the best hotel among the Myconian collection and the best hotel in Mykonos . A 4 years old 7+ stars hotel.You will feel the warm welcome on your arrival , thanks to the well trained experts at the front office and the Dynamo man ""George"" the guest relation manager.Nothing more perfect than a fully equipped room or villa where you ll find everything you need to relax during your vacation.Discover the beauty of the infinity pool and enjoy the massage experience there ; the amazing staff is waiting to pamper you.You ll taste the breakfast buffet with joy ..The shuttle bus will be at your service to carry you from and to the city center.Enjoy the 25 mins ride with the best driver in Greece "" Papis "" . He IS the best driver.A big THANK YOU to everyone who made this stay an unforgettable one .   Room Tip: Enjoy either the panoramic sea view room with a Jacuzzi or the honeymoon villa with a private pool. See more room tips",0
"We stayed at the Mykonian Villa collection as part of our honeymoon and could not be more satisfied with every aspect. From the minute we walked in, the hospitality was amazing. Katerina was wonderful between showing us the hotel as well as giving us recommendations and making arrangements for us. The hotel had a shuttle whenever you wanted to go down to their private beach (shared with the other Mykonian collection hotels). The beach was so nice and we never had a problem finding lounges. There was a free shuttle to Mykonos town every hour after 6pm. The food at the Myconian collection was delicious. The breakfast every morning was great, but even more than that the restaurant for dinner far exceeded our expectations. The hospitality was amazing, and the food was so good. We would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mykonos!",0
We were staying here for our honeymoon last week. The hotel is beautiful property and surely a must stay as its in the most peaceful part of Mykonos and their shuttle service to town is great. The only thing we didn't like was this one receptionist who was a bit rude to all our queries and had the attitude as if she didn't only own the hotel but entire Greece. Her rudeness was made up by this other lady in specs and curly hair who was the sweetest person we came across on our entire Greece tour!,2
"3rd time here and never disappoints. Lovely staff, amazing manager, clean, fab food, beautiful setting. Nothing is too much trouble. As soon as you arrive you are made to feel welcomed. The girls round the pool are friendly and helpful. The restaurant is lovely. Can't wait to return!   Room Tip: Rooms vary in style, size and price but all are beautiful See more room tips",2
"Beautiful spa-like, boutique hotel with artsy details, high-end service and excellent quality food. Wonderfully presented brunch buffet with many options - including unlimited fresh squeezed orange juice and a non-alcoholic palate-stimulating fruit smoothie when you first walk in or leave. We received a free upgrade to a suite with a private sundeck. This hotel was a highlight of our trip and we stayed at many nice hotels.",1
"Apologies very late with our review as we stayed early June! We stayed at Utopia last year, however it was fully booked for this year and with disappointment booked the Villa Collection, but any apprehension was quickly dispelled. We absolutely fell in love with the laid-back vibe and chic appearance of the resort, but what absolutely and undisputedly made our holiday was the staff! I have enjoyed cocktails all over the world but I have never tasted an Espresso Martini as good as Dimitri's, not only were they exquisite along with every other cocktail served and suggested, but combined with his charming and entertaining personality led to a few more prolonged visits to the bar than anticipated. One of the major contributions to the tranquil vibe around the swimming pool is D.J. George, his balance of hypnotic tunes blend effortlessly through to the evening, creating an intimate and romantic ambience whilst enjoying a delicious dinner on the terrace, followed by some great dance tunes which resulted in us and several guests bopping the night away! George is warm, funny & friendly, open to any requests, albeit with his own interesting but fantastic spin on the track! Have to mention the pool waitresses who are very attentive without being intrusive and nothing is to too much trouble, even when incredibly busy. Unfortunately whilst there we had to make a complaint about some unexpected building work (only lasted 1 day) but the hotel management dealt with our request in an exemplary, gracious and very generous manner. All amenities/facilities exceeded expectations and these were high after staying at Utopia. We have no hesitation in recommending this first class boutique resort, although part of us didn't wish to write this review, as would like to keep this gem to ourselves, but this would be a disservice to the management and staff. We are very much looking forward to returning same time next year.",4
"We had a room with a private outdoor pool in July 2016. It was amazing, clean and luxurious. The employees were suppppper nice especially George at the reception.The spa treatment was sooo good. It should be a 6 stars hotel not 5.   Room Tip: any room is a perfect one See more room tips",0
"This hotel is lovely. The pool is awesome and the pool bar there is great. The staff at the pool bar are awesome. We loved that they had the shuttle into the port. We took it every day. The breakfast is VERY nice. Rooms are very nice. We had a room with a private pool, though the room next to you is basically attached so the pool isn't really private, but convenient if you want to lay out in our deck and hop in quickly to cool off. We actually spent more time at the regular pool. It has great sunset views. We also really liked the spa; we did a couples massage/scrub package.",0
"My husband and I had an incredible time at the Myconian Villa Collection during our honeymoon! We cannot say enough amazing things about the impeccable service, especially by our favorite bartender Dimitri, and the lovely Elizabeth! We continue to relive the memories they helped us create. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our honeymoon so special!",0
"This hotel was absolutely amazing! The location was perfect and on the best beach in Mykonos. The bus takes you into the city every day/night and it was the best of both worlds! The staff was extremely accommodating and when we weren't thrilled about our room, they upgraded us since it was our Honeymoon. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Everything about this property was 5*!!! Breakfast and lunch were delicious and private beach area with beachside servers was awesome! Would recommend to all my friends and family.   Room Tip: Request a higher up room for a better view. See more room tips",0
We came here and we stayed 5 days - the most amazing days of our life.You really feel like home here. Nice view....nice people.Luxurious place with all the 5 star services of an exclusive villas resort.My inittially reservation was for an other 5 star hotel here in Mykonos but when we arrived in that hotel we were so dissapointed and we decided to leave and stay somewhere else.....and finally we did the right choice to come and stay in the Myconian Villas Collection.All the front desk members were so professional and helpfull...they made us feel so special..The restaurant service was excellent. The breakfast was very rich and delicious with all items needed. We will definettaly come back. Thank you Myconian Villa Collection.,0
"One of the best hotels I stayed in, the facilities are excellent but the staff are super friendly and very helpful. A nice feature about this hotel is that you can also use the amenities of all their sister hotels(next door) free of charge. Definitely recommend it and will come back again. Ask for George at the reception he's the relationship manager very helpful.",0
One of the most amazing hotels in GREECE not only in Mykonos the service was a 5* plus ..very rich breakfast ...very clean ..shuttle bus to from town until late which for mykonos is very helpful.. i am going back for sure,0
What a view! I thought I had booked a beach villa but... what we got was better. The room was spacious and clean. The plunge pool and lounge chairs were perfect. The hotel staff and management were accommodating. The buffet champagne breakfast left nothing to crave. The fitness center was sufficient. The walk to the beach was easy and the bus back convenient. The bus service to town just topped it off. The room service delays we experienced and the housekeeping not keeping to the light system keep me from ranking this facility excellent. Not to mention the palm rug into the lobby...high step it. Everything else was top notch. Thank you for our stay.,0
So we went last week to Myconian Villas.. we stayed for 4 nights. To begin with the staff is all so nice and so welcoming and our room was ready a soon as we arrived. They have the best quality of food and beverages.. the pool is so quite with amazing view from every angle of the hotel. The room is so comfy and the room service is excellent as well. Overall we were extremely satisfied and would definitely go there again if we're planning to visit Mykonos .. You should definitely stay there for your next visit !,1
"We stayed five nights in this hotel, exellent rooms, service and food, very fridenly managment and staff, everything was perfect. I strongly recommend the hotel specialy for honeymoon and peacefull holidays.Distance to town is only 20mn",2
We made a reservation at the Myconian Imperial Resort and we were upgraded to the villas at arrival. At first I wasn't sure because our room was so far away from where we checked in.... But I absolutely loved our stay in the villas!!! I felt like we were pampered and treated special! The infinity pool at the villas is awesome with salt water and the lounge chairs were so comfortable'. We also walked to the beach a couple of times and that was wonderful too! The bus service to town and back was convenient and a great perk! I can't say enough good things about this place!!!! I payed in full a couple of months ahead and got 1/3 off the price and it made it a real bargain for what we got... We also enjoyed the incredible champagne breakfast each morning....the staff was friendly and so accommodating. I can only hope we are able to come back and visit again!!!,1
"Everything about this resort is perfect.The service, food, accommodation, and all amenities are impeccable. I had a short but amazing stay, and would definitely return to this little piece of heaven one day! Highly recommended, you will not regret it",0
"The hotel was beautiful! amazing design, graet pool and facilities. the room was very enjoyable, pretty view from balcony - very unique.The staff hotel was very gracious. very helpful, and gave perferct service. responsive to every request.The location is 15-20 minutes fron center town.   Room Tip: All rooms have sea view, maybe a room with private outdoor pool in extra perfect See more room tips",1
"From the moment we entered this hotel we had a fantastic experience. The reception staff was so helpful and friendly, the room very spacious, spotless, comfortable with all things you need to make your stay great. The view from the balcony was outstanding at any time of day. Nice pool with a bar. The room was cleaned and organized several times a day and the towels changed more than once, something that I have never encountered before. Very nice decor of the hotel. Good breakfast and free shuttle to the town. We had a wonderful time here and will gladly come back for more time",0
"I can't wait to go back to this hotel. From the moment you arrive at this hotel, you are treated as VIP. The staff greats you at the door and gives you a personal guide to your room. George Manes, the guest manager made us feel very important and well taken care of! Even before check in you are given a warm hand towel and a refreshing drink. We were upgraded from the room we booked into the fabulous Villa Ftelia, which was just jaw dropping amazing! The room was amazing, every little detail was perfect very romantic. The pool is large and has plenty of chairs, and breakfast was pretty good as well. The shuttle to the town was good (its a nice shuttle, but gets full quickly and only runs to the town on the hour, so if you miss one, you have to wait a whole hour) and catching a cab back from Mykonos town wasn't too hard and cost about $20 Euro. The beach chairs provided in the private area are very comfortable, but we preferred the public area of the beach, there was better music, people watching and drinks and food served by the restaurant. I can't wait to return to this hotel one day!   Room Tip: spring for a room with its own pool, you won't regret it! See more room tips",0
The staff is super friendly and informative. Your stay will not be regretted here and the pool area bar tender and Dj make the best drinks and play the best house music!! Shoutout to Joseph and George!!! The service is top notch and scenery is beautiful!,1
"We have just returned from Myconos having spent 5 fabulous nights at the Myconian Villa Collections. The quality of the hotel, service and ambience is faultless. The rooms are spacious and clean, the public areas well maintained, neat and thoughtfully organised. The attitude of the staff and the need to go the extra mile to please visitors is exemplary. Nothing is too much and any question that is asked is met with 'Yes of course - what would you like'. The team from the hotel maids to the restaurant staff to the receptionists to the beach staff area well oiled machine and they are a credit to the management - a management team who lead by example greeting guests with a smile and introducing themselves in order to get to know their clientele better. This is the same from the General Manager (Anastasios Naoum) to his lieutenants - in particular Geroge Manes (Guest Relations Manager). Fantastic - keep up the good work - we will be back!!!",4
We had a wonderful stay!! They have the most incredible staff! The pool its really big and the spa its amazing! Look for Maria at the spa and George at the reception they are the bests! The food its really great so make your dinner plans in the hotels nearby!!,0
"Arrival into Mykonos on 4th Oct 2105 by air from Istanbul via Athens was tedious. But when we reached our hotel and checked the 5 bedroom villa at the hotel, the entire fatigue was forgotten. This was the most expensive accomodation we had booked in Greece. But it was worth it. A once in a life experience. The staff was very warm,helpful and hospitable.   Room Tip: Take a villa in the front to have a sea view. THe corner 5 bedroom suite was fantastic if you can af... See more room tips",0
"We have just returned from a wonderful holiday at this superb and stylishly chic hotel - so deserved of its 5 stars. All of the staff went out of their way to be friendly, courteous and efficient. Special mention of Elisavet (aka Elizabeth) - Hostess with the mostest - just a wee dote!, Christos the Restaurant Manager - always professional and charming, and Demitrius, Barman extraordinaire. But each and every one of the staff, and most particularly the waiters, had such a great attitude. Mykonos is a beautiful island and the Villa Collection a fabulous hotel - hopefully we will be back some day. Ta lema, Alan and Lindsay, Northern Ireland",0
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Myconian Villa for our last part of our honeymoon from June 18-21. This hotel was recommended to us as a must stay in Mykonos. And it was simply the most AMAZING hotel ever. Originally we were suppose to stay at Royal, but upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite as a gesture on the staffs behalf because it was our honeymoon. Right away they made us feel so welcomed and taken care of. We were given a tour of the entire Villa which was wonderful as many places don't usually do that. And then we were escorted to our room. The room we stay at was breathtaking..we were in shock at the very generous suite upgrade we were provided. The view was so amazing and we even had a jacuzzi to enjoy during our stay. This hotel is truly 5 stars! the staff is so friendly and anywhere you go they always smile and treat you so politely. We used the Spa for the 3 days of our stay and the ladies at the spa were simply lovely very generous and welcoming. The restaurant accommodated my vegetarian needs as I couldn't eat anything on the menu the evening we went. They made us feel so welcome and the views fromThe hotel are worth every penny. My husband and I will definitely return someday to Mykonos as we loved the whole experience. We are beyond happy we were able to experience this amazing hotel. And one very important tip, if you do go...it is a better option to rent your own car if you wish to go around the island...taxi service is VERY limited and having your own means of transportation really makes a difference. Thank you Myconian Villa for the outstanding service and wonderful stay my husband and I got to enjoy.",1
"We stayed for four days. The hotel is a bit away from the beach but walking distance and a nice pool makes up for it. Friendly and helpful staff - real service. My drycleaning service arrived late but the staff was very apologetic and tried to remedy the situation. Very nice facilities, great breakfast. My wife was enthusiastic about the spa. Very minor negatives: the individual ""villas"" from the hotel description are really more like (nice) apartments in a big spread out building, the terrace of our room (and it would seem all rooms) was covered, and there was no way to uncover it to take in the sun, and the individual pool of our room was too deep to stand in anywhere, which I guess is a good or a bad thing depending on whether you want to be diving in it all the time or just stay standing in it to cool off an relax. But overall, a great experience.",2
"Spending a week in such a beautiful hotel makes it seem almost to good to be true. The scenery is amazing and the view from the villa is breath taking. The villa sits at the top of a hill and has a private Jacuzzi that overlooks the deep blue sea surrounded by hills and cliffs. The service of the staff is outstanding and the food served is exquisite. Although the hotel seems along way from little Venice and the main attraction around Mikonos they conveniently provide shuttles to the village; I on the other hand preferred to rent a scooter and roam around the little island as I pleased.   Room Tip: breath taking views, luxurious See more room tips",2
Very nice hotel with great facilities within walking distance of the beach. We really enjoyed our time here. The decor is out of this world - simple and gorgeous! The staff were very friendly and helpful. This was truly a no stress experience. We loved the way we were greeted and checked in. We were asked to relax on the sofa while the reception checked us in which means the staff understands that after a long flight the last thing you want to do is wait in line to be checked in. The food and restaurant was also excellent. We will highly recommend this hotel.,1
"The Villa Collection is amazing. The staff is very kind and helpful and our room was phenomenal with a fantastic view of the beach. The overall quality of the property, rooms, staff and food was great. We would definitely recommend this property.",1
"Fabulous week at Myconian Villa resort .excellent rooms , staff brilliant especially Christos, Elias, and Elizabeth ..so helpful.celebtrating a big birthday and wedding anniversarybreakfast buffet including champagne very satisfying lunch by pool fantastic   Room Tip: room with sea view amazing to wake up to See more room tips",1
I highly recommend the Myconian Villa Collection for anyone who has never visited Mykonos before. The location has the most breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea which is simply stunning and visible from most rooms.The reason for my visit here was to host a conference and the staff were super attentive and catered to our very demanding group and they completely exceeded our expectations at every level....shout out to Harrys and Apostolos at the Imperial and Anastasious at the Villas.If you are thinking of planning a trip to Mykonos then I whole heartedly recommend any of the hotels within this family run group. The owners are personable and go above and beyond to ensure you are looked after and made to feel welcome. I very much look forward to returning for a personal holiday very soon!,2
"Words sometimes are not enough to explain the excellence of the great greek hospital we have received from everyone during our stay in Myconian collection villas few days ago . Attention to detail from everyone and some of the most amazing staff i could ever meet .. Aggeliki Kallia , Maria Ioannidou and of course the amazing Gwgw Karasa are some of the great people who made our stay the best ever in Mykonos. I am so proud knowing when it comes to greek luxury hospitality i can relate to Myconian villas Collection. Keep up the good work everyone and we will see you all soon again and very soon . Mr Naoum you should be very proud for all the staff and once again from the very bottom of my heart thank you so much for everything you did for us …Kind regardsPapadopoulos Axilleas",0
"My husband and I were so excited to stay here, as it was our first Greek island we were visiting. We were in Athens prior and our travel agent had everything planned perfectly. The trip was flawless. When we arrived in Mykonos, there was nobody waiting for us at the airport. We had plenty of confirmation documents, yet nobody was there for us. After looking around for 15 minutes we saw a lady coming from a parking lot with a Myconian Collection shirt. I told her our name and sure enough we were on the list- yet she said they had no confirmation of our arrival. We had to wait an hour for a ride to pick us up at take us to the hotel. We aren't usually ones so complain, but we were a bit frustrated. Once we arrived we were greeted by some friendly staff members, but we were awkwardly standing there as nobody really told us where to go or what to do. When we were told we could sit down we were brought some amazing beverages and were told a little bit about the hotel, but very minimal. *I might add that the hotel decor was insanely gorgeous. It might have been one of the most beautiful lobby's I've ever been in!!* I forgot who we talked to about our transportation situation, but the hotel seemed to blame it on our travel agent for the mix up and didn't want to take responsibility for a mistake. That really bothered us. Soon after, the manager greeted us and told us he had a surprise for us. We were taken to our room and boy were we surprised. We were upgraded to an incredible villa that probably could sleep 12 people. When hotels make mistakes and then make up for it, I quickly forget about the mistakes. We would have been completely satisfied with just some free snacks or something, but this was unreal!!!! The reason I am giving the hotel a 4 is not because of the mix up with transportation, but for the communication between staff members and guests as well as many of the staff members not being super friendly. Communication:We were given a schedule of the shuttle times but weren't told where they go, where we are dropped off, etc. we took a taxi to Mykonos town but when we asked where the shuttle would pick us up we were told to meet the bus at the old port. When we dropped off the hotel guests at another property that wasn't ours, the driver told us we had to get out of the bus and have the hotel call for a shuttle to take us to our exact hotel. We had no idea it was such a process. We wanted to go to dinner that evening on the shuttle and I'm so glad I asked for a dinner recommendation because I was told we told wait for the shuttle at our hotel, but we had to walk to the hotel below ours. I would have been waiting and waiting had I not known we had to walk down to the other hotel. The staff wasn't the friendliest here and we often felt like we were being judged. It could have been a language barrier thing or maybe the hotel just didn't want to pry. It was just a little uncomfortable! The staff at all restaurants and bars were extremely friendly though!!We did love the location and the food was delicious. Given the hiccup we still would recommend this hotel and would stay here again!",0
We stayed in this hotel for two nights and those were not enough i wish i could have had more nights in myconian villa . The hotel is amazing property and defines luxury in all aspects .From our arrival on port till our departure to airport stay was super luxurious and service of staff and reception was outstanding. It is one of the best property in whole greece and europe as a whole.We were given Villa with private jacuzzi with breathtaking view of Agean sea.The infinity pool of hotel was just amazing sitting right on top of elia beach.I surely recommend this hotel to everyone who are planning a trip to mykonos.,1
"This resort is the apex modern luxury. I've vacationed here three times and it never fails to amaze. The breakfast buffet is honestly the best buffet I'm ever had. It is simple and elegant. The infinity pool is especially relaxing. One complaint with the pool is its unusual saltiness. The pool service is nice but rather expensive. The view from the pool is worth everything. The constant van service is great for going to the beach and other parts of the resort. Like most Greek beaches the water is pristine and calm, perfect for long swims and snorkeling. There is also a great hiking trail up the side of the hill which allows for a quick workout and a great view. For dinner you can have the concierge reserve a table at any restaurant in the resort. I strongly suggest eating at the sushi restaurant aswell as visiting utopia for dinner. The room I stayed in most recently had a master bedroom and an extremely comfortable couch that was made into a bed. I slept terrifically every night. My room also had a deck with a hot tub overlooking the pool and ocean. The staff is very nice and helpful. One of my traveling companions became good friends with one of the beach staffers. I hope to visit again this year, it is simply amazing!",2
"We stayed in the hotel at the end of May/beginning of June for 6 days and can’t recommend it more! The hotel itself is beautiful with white decor and modern art throughout. We had 2 interconnecting rooms on the top floor and couldn’t believe how big they were, they were stunning and we had a huge balcony with an amazing sea view. We can’t fault the rooms at all, they were spotlessly clean, spacious and the beds were so comfortable! The pool area is beautiful with a lovely infinity pool and some of the most comfortable sunbeds I have found at any hotel. The pool staff bring around refreshments and cold flannels throughout the day. The food and drink at the pool restaurant and at breakfast as well was delicious. One of the best things about the hotel is the outstanding service provided by the hotel staff, who are all extremely friendly and couldn’t be more willing to help. We were initially concerned about the location of the hotel being quite far from everything, however the free hotel shuttle which runs every hour into town meant that this was not a problem at all. This service is brilliant and we used the shuttle most days. My only criticism is that there is no complimentary drinking water around the pool area, so we bought large bottles of water in town to bring back each day, as the water was quite expensive and you would end up spending a lot if you were to buy water all throughout the day.Overall we had a wonderful relaxing stay and I would definitely recommend it!",2
"During our 1 week stay we had a wonderfull time! The view, the staff, the service, the atmosphere, ... Whatever you can imagine, it was simply amazing! For us it was an excellent experience and a time to never forget. A special thank you to the staff.",0
Me and my boyfriend spent a week in May..I am Greek and I had to show him the Greek Beaty and Luxury..Was the best week..!! The service was flawless and the quality of the drinks and food really high..! I recommend this hotel if you want to treat yourselves with a truly luxury break..!A big thank you to all the guys there for the amazing time we had..!,0
"We spent a week here at the end of May (fantastic weather). One of the most relaxing holidays ever.Without exception the management and staff were excellent, attentive without being intrusive and made us feel very welcome.We stayed in a prestige room with private pool - spacious and comfortable with a large balcony and small pool in which to relax with a beautiful view of the bay. Excellent housekeeping and room service (private dining on the balcony).The decor in our room and throughout the hotel is tastefully designed and gorgeously understated.The breakfast buffet (including champagne) was comprehensive and delicious, as was the poolside bistro/bar. The restaurant was innovative and I'd particularly recommend the quail with pistachio risotto and the lemon desert. A fantastic range of delicious Greek wines.My only criticism would be the overly sensitive automated minibar which appears to charge you for the entire contents if you breathe on it! However, not a problem to resolve with the excellent reception staff.(The mark of a great hotel is how they deal with any problems)We will definitely return",2
"My wife and I visited for 4 nights at the end of May. The hotel is absolutely stunning and perfect in every way. We simply cannot fault a thing.The general decor around the hotel is very pleasant with lots of nice modern art pieces. We stayed in a standard room with hot tub. The room was very spacious with a huge balcony with 2 sun beds, table and chairs as well as the hot tub. The rooms decor is lovely, virtually all white. The bed was very comfortable and the sleep quality excellent.The pool area is stunning, very peaceful. Breakfast is a buffet affair and has a large selection of fresh foods.We ate lunch at the pool restaurant which is varied and excellent quality. We also are dinner at the main restaurant which was superb. Very exciting dishes with fresh ingredients.We also used the spa for a massage which was excellent. My wife and I had the massages in the same room which was a nice touch.The shuttle bus to and from Mykonos town and the free shuttle service to the airport and very nice touches and very welcome.Finally the staff from reception to the pool bar to the restaurants and spa were ALL excellent and couldn't do enough to help us and make our stay the magical one it was. I wish I had some of their names to mention but unfortunately I don't.Finally, whilst in Mykonos we ate some incredible food. I'd highly recommend Kikis for lunch on the other side of the island (we hired a quad bike via reception for the day to get there). Hakkasan in Mykonos Town was one of the best meals we have ever had (I have been to both Hakkasan's in alo don several times and this was better) with the setting making it even better. We also went to the famous Nammos beach club early one evening which was very good although outbid season so a little quieter.I couldn't recommend this place enough. We travel a fair bit with and without out children and stay in some nice places and we feel, on balance this is the best hotel we have stayed at. We have also fallen in love with Mykonos.",0
"We spent 3 wonderful nights in the Villa Collections. Peaceful location, picturesque Elia beach, luxurious rooms, Jacuzzi, wonderful food, outstanding service. Large sea water infinity pool. As close to paradise as one can get. Free and frequent shuttles to Mykonos town. Ten points out of ten. No objections. I add some photos. Very recommended.",1
We have just from Myconian villa collection hotel. The villas are a5 stars resort.All of them are facing the Aegean Sea. The room are nice with balcony. Breakfast is the best you are able to imaging Don't miss the variety of the fruit cocktails in the entrance at f the restaurant. All the team are very polite and very efficient They do the best to make you happyThe cleanliness of the villas is excellentWe had a great time   Room Tip: Room 839 is a nice one with out a pool Room 676 is nice one with a pool and a large balcony See more room tips,0
"I've been here for my fifth times this year. I've been always very satisfied other way I wouldn't return here, but sometimes staff's behavior is just strange. For example when we arrived a very kind guy from the reception asked us if it was the first time for us there and when we answered it was the fifth a nice welcoming smile welcomed us and after ten minutes a fruit platter and a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room. Nice! People of the staff are almost always very kind and attentive, but sometimes some of them just seem to behave like were a pain in the a... for them. Alternate behavior in different moments, but what I really couldn't stand was the lady that checked us out (the tallest of the staff), that at the end of the procedure didn't say even farewell, ciao, ãåéÜ óïõ, go to hell, nothing!! She just gave me my envelope with my invoice and answered the phone, as she didn't give a damn about their guests. This is a five star hotel and this kind of behavior is just unacceptable! I'll go there maybe some more times, but I really hope to deal with somebody else.",0
"Aesthetically mindblowing interiors. A view to die for. Ultra luxurious Jaccuzzis in your private balcony. A lovely infinity pool. A lovely private beach just down the hill. A very convenient bus shuttle to Mykonos town (the driver needs a special mention for his kickass driving skills, you'll know what i'm talking about when you get on that bus). In all, this hotel knows how to pamper all your senses.   Room Tip: Pick the ones with the jaccuzzi. They're great! See more room tips",0
"The room was nice and clean, the view was great, the food was delicious. However if you are a noise-sensitive person, like the water pumps used for the pools that make a constant terrible noise that can drive a person mad, don't take the private pool room. The management promised to help but nothing have been done. I've been unable to sleep for three days and therefore it has ruined my whole hotel and vacation experience.",0
"Just returned home from Mykonos, Myconian Villa Collection. I can honestly say I did not want to leave. This 5 star hotel is truly amazing, with free transfers from the Airport taking approx. 30 mins (white leather Mercedes mini bus). The view is incredible, the interior decor is simple and absolutely stunning in this hotel as well as the other Myconian Collection hotels (we had a nose as we went past). The staff are very friendly and will do anything you ask. The main infinity pool is breath taking, giving a full view of the ocean and mountains, the whole pool area is spotless and you get waited on for any food or drinks - cocktails come with dried fruit and nuts. Loads of loungers and bean bags as well as an eating area. Breakfast is very good - huge range of food from cereal to bacon and eggs to waffles to fruit salad, fish and all breads! Room service is a €6 charge on top of what ever you order, detailed menu in the room and a mini bar. The rooms themselves - we stayed in a sea view room for the first 6 nights (685) and it was gorgeous with again amazing decor as well as a balcony and a terrace with loungers. We then moved to an outdoor jacuzzi room for the last 4 nights and it was totally worth it (734), our view was even better and the room itself was very spacious and decorated to a very high quality. House keeping happens twice a day (morning time to leave your room prepped for the daytime and then late evening so it is prepped for the night - very impressive standard, everything is spotlessly tidy). Elia beach is just down the road and is pretty with a lovely bar/restaurant although we recommend getting an ATV for the day (€35, which reception kindly arranged for us) and going to Kalo Livadi beach also. The shuttle into Mykonos town is free (25 mins journey approx.) and very useful (9am, 2pm then 6pm every hour til 12am) also returning on the half past. Taxis are around €25 one way and therefore it is worth waiting for the shuttle. Mykonos town is immaculate with amazing views, loads of shops both affordable and designer as well as hundreds of places to eat. Great sun set and impressive yachts in the port. The weather here (May 8th - 18th) was perfect, mixture of very hot days with some cooler days and only one rainy day for about 20 minutes! If i was going to be really picky - Our double bed in the jacuzzi room was 2 separate mattresses and a double duvet on its side to fit the bed which caused it to come up slightly short - not good for me because I'm 6'3 and my feet were hanging out of it. The shuttle into town filled up with petrol on our return which made the journey about an hour long - not good for travel sickness and we had plans. This could have been done in their own time. The pools infinity edge attracts a lot of little birds which were no bother, however their poo is not a pleasant sight so this could be brushed off the edge slightly more often, however did not really affect us. Also as there is no local shop, the hotel prices are rather high (€14 for a half glass cocktail, €6 for a snickers in the mini bar, and meals at dinner are a lot higher than those in the town) however i guess this is expected from a 5 star hotel. Over all, an amazing stay. I would 100% return and recommend it to everyone of any age. I will never forget this holiday! Thank you Myconian Collection :)",1
"We have just returned from the most relaxing, restful holiday.The villas are everything you expect from a 5* resort and more. The views over the Aegean Sea are spectacular as are the sunsets. The hotel taxi service to/from the hotels private beach at the foot of the hill is first class. Breakfast is a feast, such a variety of delicious hot/cold choices. Cristos, the f&b manager and all his team are very particular about the service all the guests receive.The same can be said re our evening meal, the menu is varied, always delicious and perfectly presented. There is an excellent bus service to/from Mykonos town centre, but we only used this service a couple of times as we didn't want to leave the villa's. We were made to feel like we were the only guests there, although the resort was full! A special thank-you to some of the wonderful staff it was our pleasure to meet. Bubbly Elizabeth who always greeted us so warmly at meal times, Costas 1 & 2, Tilos the 'cheeky boy', Alex, 'lovely young man'. Having said that, without exception, every member of staff treated us so warmly but never imposed, very professional. We believe the reason for this very welcoming and inviting atmosphere is the manager at the helm, Anastasios Naoum. He has chosen his staff with great care and this reflects in the very smooth running in every department of the hotel. Thank you all for a very special holiday, but Mr Naoum, we have just one complaint - the sea could have been a few degrees warmer!!!!Wishing you all a fabulous season.",3
"I went in a big group and it was very nice. The services was excellent. The food is great. The rooms is pretty differs each one. It is a good place to rest and enjoy beautiful view, like a paradise... All place on this hotel is very clean. The room services is very nice.",1
"From the moment we pulled up in the car park we knew we were on to something special. The hotel is absolutely spotless and stunning. The views cannot be beaten, overlooking the bay and beaches. Rooms were outstanding, comfortable and clean. The staff will go out of their way to make your stay phenomenal. Especially the evening hostess Elizabeth, who was an absolute delight. The general manager came to see us at breakfast on our last morning to ensure everything had been as we wanted. It had been and more!! If you're expecting a cheap stay look again, but value for the money you pay is here, and just the most amazing experience. I've been to a lot of restaurants but I have to say the restaurant in this hotel serves THE BEST STEAK ANYWHERE!! I simply cannot praise this hotel and the staff enough. GO THERE!!!",0
"I am not a fan of luxury hotels...more of a experience person but this one needs a special mention. We stayed in myconian villa collection which had a private infinity pool overseeing the sea. never even I had this experience in my life.Service, rooms, drinks everything is irreplaceable",1
"My wife, 2 daughters - 11 & 13 stayed here for 3 nights and had a fabulous time! Spent our anniversary here, they gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne alongwith a platter of exotic fruits in our room, ever smiling helpful and courteous staff - special mention for Christos, George, Katerina, Georgia, breakfast buffet was excellent, providing even a gluten free option, the spa was amazing, must try the essential oil treatment pools, it was a one of a kind experience, tranquil, beautiful and quiet!! Hotel Shuttles were available to go to downtown freely and frequently! Food was excellent in the hotel. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and felt totally pampered!   Room Tip: There are several wings so figure out what facilities are in which wing before you request a room See more room tips",1
"i don't usually write reviews but after recently returning back from my family holiday i can't help but to tell people about my fantastic experience while staying in the myconian villa collection, first i want to thank all the staff for been so welcoming,the hotel is by far one of the best i have stayed in.its extremely clean and the interior design is utterly beautiful! the pool side and restaurant has views to die for!! the area is quite and around 15 to 20 minutes away from mykonos town so i would definitely recommend to hire a car the roads are extremely easy to get around however there is a transport bus that takes you to town ever hour!! the breakfast is fantastic with a great choice, i would recommend this for couples and a relaxing family holiday ....my only complaint is the bed!!! its that compatible i couldnt get out !!!   Room Tip: the villa all have sea front and quite as it is a walk away from reception See more room tips",2
"On our honeymoon trip, went to two Greek islands and Athens Greece. This place was the best. So clean, unique, friendly, and has the best views. Every corner you look you see a picture perfect view. It's at a secluded part of the island, but it's perfect because the beach is at walking distance, and they have free hourly shuttles to take you in town and back. It's the perfect place to stay if you want to have a real Mykonos experience.",1
"We booked 4 nights at the Royal Myconian Spa (all owned by the same group!) but when we arrived we were taken to the Myconian Villa Collection as work was still being done on the Royal. There was a bit of confusion for everyone on our complimentary transfer as everyone ended up in a hotel they hadn't booked! BUT....The Myconian Villa Collection did not disappoint! Stunning architecture, interior styling and staff made this hotel a delight from the moment we arrived. White walls, contemporary mirrors and art and driftwood style furniture create an amazing calm, tranquil location for any holiday. Our room was large, airy, high spec and luxurious, with a huge bathtub with sea views. The bed is possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.The pool area is chilled, comfortable and serene with panoramic sea views and delightful staff that are beyond accommodating.The on site restaurant serves delicious, modern Mediterranean food and great wines - again with impeccable service. The staff here are a real credit to the hotel; everyone we met was polite, kind and smiling all the time. They all work incredibly hard and are attentive to your every need. The whole collection of Myconian hotels appear to be utterly stunning. We were delighted with this hotel and the way the staff dealt with relocating everyone whilst they finished the other hotel - other venues would have just checked you in and let the work carry on around you!The hotel is a 5 minute leisurely walk to Elia beach - which is delightful - and also Elia Mediterranean Restaurant on the beach which serves excellent food and wines. I cannot recommend this hotel any higher - it's 5 stars from us and we will certainly return! Thank you Myconian Villa Collection!",2
"This is hotel is simply amazing. If you choose to stay here I would thoroughly recommend visiting the spa. I had a men's facial and a massage and both treatments were exceptional. It's definitely a high-end spa in terms of treatments, environment, and staff. Speaking of staff, the front of house team in the pool bar, restaurant, and reception were all great. The service was very attentive without being intrusive. My room was a really good size, very tastefully furnished, and had an amazing view out to the sea. The food is also great - I recommend the pork souvlaki!",1
"Visited during honeymoon... If you want to stay near the town, this is not the place for you, the hotel is located on a hill overlooking Elia Beach which is about 25-30 mins from Port-Town and other beaches and island attractions.In general the installations are good and the ambience is nice, the room we stayed in was quite average for a 5 star and the bathroom has little privacy as it has no door. But all is good until we get to the annoying communication system these people have. While sleeping late about 11 am, they called 4 times during the morning, even though my husband told them to call later, they do not respect the DND sign on the door, the maid knocked 2 times as she had to do the room, than some other guy came to ask if we were already leaving. The day of departure they were calling 40 mins before checkout time to find out if they could pick up our luggage. It almost felt like we were being thrown out.Not friendly or helpful staff on front desk whatsoever.",0
This place left both me and my girlfriend speechless. Absolutely amazing view overlooking the best beach on the island. I had no complaints whatsoever. From my room to the staff to the breakfast to the lunch and dinner. Everything was absolutely amazing. I spent my 30 bday here and it was one to remember. I recommend it to any couple in a Mykonos get away. I could keep writing forever explains how amazing my stay was. I loved it and look forward to a return without a doubt. Thank you myconian villas. Thank you.,0
"My boyfriend took me to the Myconian Villa Collection for my 31st birthday, only for a long weekend.Weather was very temperamental with the first two days being wet and hot but very windy (20/21 degrees) on our remaining two days.I had initially booked a hire car as I read there was only 32 taxis that operate around the island and the wait time could be long. Note I had to swap to a manual car (as initially booked) but they provided me with an automatic as it was what the majority of the people drove due to hills and steep terrains. And the hotel was on a rather steep slope so if you're not a confident driver then it's best to either go for automatic, if you are ok to operate, or stick with taxis.Ok so pros and cons for the hotel...PROS:- Upon arrival we were greeted at the front door by a 'service attendance' who showed us around the grand hotel while our room was being prepared (we arrived early). We were shown around the spa area, pool and restaurant. Great to know instead of being left on our own and left to wander like lost sheep.- Upgrade to an impressive yet beautiful executive room with wonderful view of the ocean, twin sinks, bath and a large shower.Beach towels were provided in the cupboard and also around the pool area.- Hotel provided me with a birthday cake! :-)My bf and I were very impressed with the level of service which we had never received from other hotels so thank you!- The staff were very receptive and informative of the surrounding area and provided us with guidance of where to visit. But during our short time we only managed to visit Mykonos town and the windmills. However we were quoted £50 pp to visit Delos which was more than what I originally saw advertised some weeks before we arrived (should be circa £35).- Bar staff provided us with the most tastiest drinks with the best one called Bora Bora (mocktail). Alcoholic drinks were free poured.- I had the best massage with complimentary facial and head massage though at a price of 85euros .Indoor spa pool was very clean and they even provide you with fresh fruit and a drink.- Breakfast was very varied and quite healthy! They offered a small selection of hot ""American Breakfast"" which was your usual Greek sausage, fried eggs, bacon...The rest were fruit, a vast selection of bread, cereal. meat and cheese cuts etc.CONS:OK I hate to break out the negativity for such an exclusive hotel but the two things which both my boyfriend and I agreed upon were..- FoodWe decided to book a reservation for dinner on my birthday night. He ordered seafood pasta dish and I ordered chicken orzo (also pasta). We waited over 45 minutes before it was given to us and even then it was warm.No bread was offered like other establishments do while we waited. But for around 20 euros each being main dished we felt it was such huge let down. He only had one prawn and roughly 3 mussels (I believe) and mine was more like a starter with two small cylinder shaped chicken breast and a ladle of tiny pasta. I had to order another main of burger and chips as I barely felt I'd eaten.Oh and note I had water poured for me into my small cup and I was charged 5 euros.I did inform the waiter but he just said ""sorry you didn't enjoy it"". So unless you have money to burn, have a patience of a saint and have an appetite of small cat then I wouldn't recommend eating here.On our last night we drove down the road (5 mins walk if you can handle the hill!) to a restaurant which sits on the side of Elia beach and we had the best meal there. We ordered 2 mains, 2 desserts with drinks and it was 20 euros cheaper than the hotel. Plus the atmosphere was more lively and we only waited 15 minutes for food to come out. Think it was called Elia Restaurant so take a visit if you can.- Cost of drinks were extortionate. We did ask for a drinks menu which they weren't able to provide and we didn't pay for anything for the first 2 days. However on our third day we were asked for our room number and we were then charged for the drinks we had so far but this wasn't clear and we were never told by anyone that they were inclusive or how much the drinks were.Overall we loved the situation of the hotel, how they were beyond our expectation to making my birthday special, how generous they were with the room upgrade but the food and cost of drinks felt below average.In all honesty I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5.Yes I would definitely return to the hotel but know now to eat elsewhere!",1
"Excellent service, hotel very nice and brand new, nice decorationeverything clean and staff customer focus at 100%. We really appreciate the free shettule to go in myconos city as we wanted. We stay 5 days and we didn t get time to be bored!Do not hesitate amd book;)",0
A beautiful place with an excellent service especialy with Elisabeth Who was very Kind. A big thank you for The staff in restaurants.The same for the front desk Who was very useful and for the staff in charge of cleaning the room Juste one bad thing the pool was a bit to cool,1
Have visited Myconos during out 10 days trip to Greece. We have booked Myconian Imperial Resort however got an upgrade to their villa property named Myconian Villa Collection. It was very well maintained property though a little far from port and main market. however hotel provides shuttle service to port every hour free of cost to their guests. Room was tastefully decorated with an uninterrupted sea view from balcony. Beach is at walking distance and is very clean. one of the best properties of Mykonos.   Room Tip: all rooms are good and facing sea view... See more room tips,0
"This is a beautiful hotel, a little far from Myconos town, but unique and trendy.It has a rocky beach 5 minutes walk, with lounges, umbrellas and bar service. While the beach was nice, it didn't seem spectacular while in Mykonos.The hotel is amazing, with breathtaking views from every point, chill out music, infinity pool, great restaurant and service.The rooms are all in whites, clean, spotless, well appointed. Nice bathroom, without doors which may be uncomfortable. I stayed with my two teenager daughter and son, and they put an extra bed so the room seemed somewhat little.We had dinner at the hotel the 3 nights we stayed, always excellent.Breakfast buffet is also superb.We used the transportation provided from and to the airport, a bit confusing when arriving..we waited for almost an hour at the arrivals zone.We also used their transportation to get to Myconos Town, which was very good.",0
"Beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff and management. The main town is 20 minutes away but great service provided by hotel to get us there and back. Quite expensive though, a little overpriced really compared to some real top hotels I have stayed at. I would though stay again as service is everything and you certainly get treated very well here. I was not convinced by their restaurant. They want a Michelin star but I'm afraid it falls very short on quality and seasonality of menu. A lot of heavy wintery dishes on a hot night is not what is required. Really would like to see more local Greek dishes cooked to a high standard. Thankfully we ate very well in town saving much money in doing so. I would definately recommend this hotel but make sure your bank balance is healthy first. Lastly our room cleaner was amazing, twice a day she cleaned and tidied and could not leave our baby alone. Very busy resort so unlikely to change prices.",1
"I was SO excited to stay at this hotel. Truly, I booked it months in advance based on the photos and reviews, and even though there was another hotel I was interested in, I couldn't get this one out of my mind so I kept my reservation. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype. For example:1. My room had body hair (barf) literally all over the bathroom and the tub. Fortunately, they upgraded us, but it was my first impression and I couldn't get it out of my mind.2. The rate included a daily soak in the spa pools. Unfortunately, they failed to mention you needed to make a reservation prior to arrival. We arrived on day 1 to make a reservation and found out the first day was already booked.3. It also included transportation to and from Mykonos Town. What they don't tell you is there are like 2 pickup times during the day. The resort is very remote.4. It included poolside sorbet and fruit - none of it was ever offered.5. It included transportation to the airport. We were told we could be transported at 4:30am for our flight...until we woke up reaaally early and sat in their lobby for an hour because they didn't have a driver and said we should have double-checked.6. It included complimentary champagne breakfast every day. Again, not offered. I finally spotted the bottles and asked for it...7. Speaking of service at the restaurant, it was TERRIBLE. I asked for cream for coffee and had to ask 2 more times to actually get it. Upon hearing my second request, I watched the server nod and then go clear a table. Finally, my husband got up and poured milk into a bowl from the buffet. When the server finally brought me the cream, my coffee was ice cold.I could go on, but I won't. Beautiful facilities in the common area and great pool. Management was great and really tried to help, but clearly it's the rest of the staff that's the problem.Mykonos is a once in a lifetime trip for many, including myself. I look back on my experience at Myconian Villa collection as the one regret I have in a 3 week long European adventure. I wouldn't stay there again.",5
A beautiful hotel with a great location offering a wonderful view. The breakfast is very good. The staff was very gracious and accommodating. I have loved the design of our room. The hotel is very relaxing and has beautiful architecture.   Room Tip: The room design is beautiful. See more room tips,0
"We had a wonderful break here, very relaxing. It has a distinctive modern style but the sunshine and warmth from the staff made it a very comfortable stay. The room was very comfortable and everything was immaculate.The only thing that wasn't up to their usual standard was the bus transfers into town. The bus itself was very clean and of a good standard but you have to walk to the other hotel to catch it (not a problem) but it then becomes a free for all to get on, getting there early doesn't help as the exact position it stops varies. The bus was always full (evenings) and sometimes people didn't' get on. It's a nice service but could be organised differently to remove the stress and hurly burly!The spa girls were great, very accommodating. We tried the Thalassotherapy pools and various treatments - all good. Good international and local brands.The pool was a little on the cool side but it was the beginning of the season when we went but oh how I wish I was back there now..... The choice of food at breakfast was extensive and the attentive staff always offered pancakes, waffles, omelettes etc the coffee was so smooth. The lunch menu by the pool was good, lots of healthy options and not so healthy if you wished! Diner was good too, restaurant not too busy we found most people went into town. Oh and we had some lovely cocktails in the bar.We will definitely be going back - just got to fit it in with work!",1
"If you're looking for a relaxing stay in Mykonos then this is your place. It is away from the hustle and bustle but if you want to go into the town there is a bus every hour in the evening from 6 till 12 (it takes around 20 minutes.) Note that during the day there are only 2 buses (9pm and 2pm) into the town. Taxis range from about 20-30 (40 late at night) euro per trip. We drove past another highly rated hotel on our way into the town and I must say the Myconian Villa Collection has a much better position on the island, unless you really need to be within walking distance from the town.The rooms in the hotel are spotless - we chose a room with a Jacuzzi and were put in a great spot right in the corner. You can change the temperature of the hot tub but it takes hours and the evenings can get a bit chilly so we turned it up before we went out. The staff are all welcoming & the hotel wasn't pretentious at all, however it still had a touch of high luxury. Overall we had a great stay in Myconian Villa Collection and will certainly be back.   Room Tip: Room on the corner See more room tips",0
Booked the hotel for my wife's birthday celebration. Amazing views and a fantastic hotel all round. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and courteous. A couple of things went wrong during our stay but the manager Mr. Anastasios Naoum made sure that we were well looked after and took the trouble to personally follow up and remedy the issues. Will definitely go back.,0
"5 stars in every way. We were lucky enough to find a room here on our honeymoon. The property is on a stunning mountain with breathtaking views. If you love a nice hotel, with mid-century coastal design this property will appeal to you. Breakfast at the property was the highlight of our entire honeymoon. Cannot wait to go back one day.   Room Tip: It is quite far from the town but the resort has a shuttle arrangement that will drive you in and ou... See more room tips",0
"This hotel is top! The views are amazing, the service and the staff is great and the rooms are nice. The beds are so comfortable that you want to stay in bed longer. We took two rooms, both of them with sea view and one with a private pool.Don't miss the chance to have cocktails by the infinity pool and also bring ur camera in the night because the decoration and lights of the pool and trees make the best pictures.The hotel provides transportation from ferry station and downtown at diverse times. I would be happy to come back",0
"As you will see from my profile I reviewed 3 hotels, because Mykonos truly stole my heart and kept it. I was meant to stay 4 nights ended up staying 2 weeks between Cavo Tagoo, Bill and Coo, Myconian Villas and Myconian Utopia.This hotel made my holiday, I was moving hotels because of high season and ended up staying in their fabulous Agio Sostis. The biggest villa with a private pool meant for probably 12 people! Thank you thank you Tasos, the manager for not only being a superb host but also becoming a friend. The staff was incredible, becoming slowly a small family to me. Eva, you re the best for being so present and always there when I had an issue. Alex at the restaurant, amazing. Vaso, my villa maid. God I will sure miss you! George at reception for sorting out a small check out issue, your Italian is spot on! Anna at the boutique, what can I say. I shopped a storm and while shopping a found a great person! I miss every moment of my stay there and I cannot wait to come back next year not only to experience the magical service you offer, but also to see you all again! Efharisto poli",0
"A five star hotel in every way. No expense was spared to make this hotel as luxurious and beautiful as possible. The room was amazing, looking over the ocean. Housekeeping came by 2 times a day. The breakfast buffet was the most extensive and well laid out meal that I have ever seen, and the kitchen took requests for eggs, coffee, and pancakes. Relaxing by the pool all day was perfect, with staff always available to request a meal or drink from. The restaurant (which you need to book over the phone) had very good food for a reasonable price. Overall, this experience was absolutely amazing and I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",0
"We've only spent two nights here, the hotel is amazing and we felt like being in a luxurious living room once we stepped into the entrance. Our room had a private pool overlook the Aegean ocean, so we didn't go to the public pool nor the private beach (it's a bit of walk, you need to pass through another M hotel). We could overhear the music playing from the bar chilling by the pool side, which made it more relaxing and fun (and it's super quiet once you are inside of the room). All rooms seem well maintained but the one above us had a burning chimney top so we could see a lot of tiny ashes floating on our private pool, but it didn't bother us too much, this should be easily fixed by the hotel management. Despite the remote location, Myconian collection has occupied the most of the mountain and made it own paradise. You are able to access all M hotels if you don't mind to climb up and down the hill. There is a free shuttle bus goes to the old port everyday, 2 times during the day (9am and 2pm), and every hour after 6pm. It takes less than 30 mins to the town. The only complain I would have is that the hotel charged our arrival transfer which we used the free shuttle bus hotel operates everyday, it is not like the hotel specially arranged the transfer for us, even though it was only 16 euros for 3 pax, it would make more sense if it were free because we took the bus just like any others but with luggage. Hotel also arranged our departure transfer to the new port, it was also 16 euros which was very reasonable since they don't have a daily bus runs from the new port. Overall, I would highly recommend to stay here if you want have an amazing experience in Mykonos.",0
"Excellent service, beautiful location. Food and pool was dreamlike. The concierge was excellent, their recommendations and advise was perfectly on point. They are a group ofmhotels and you are allowed to use the services at each hotel.",0
"We had 8 nights in Elia at the Myconian Villas and had a great time - the views from all of the rooms is stunning over the sea. The hotel was beautiful - the rooms were of high standard and well maintained, as were all of the public areas including the bar and restaurant. Mykonos isn't a cheap island in general and this is reflected in the price of the food and drink at the hotel, although all was very good, including breakfast. The hotel has a private part of the beach where you could always get a sun lounger and was a nice alternative to a day around the pool.The hotel loses a star for two reasons: Whilst the service was generally very good, there were a few individuals who didn't live up to the same standards. The main downside though was the distance from Mykonos Town. Elia doesn't have any restaurants apart from one on the beach so you have to get the included shuttle bus which takes 20 minutes. It wasn't a huge inconvenience running every hour at night, but isn't the same as a stroll to and from a restaurant.Be aware that the shuttle transfers to and from the airport aren't included - we weren't made aware of this until we paid our balance at check-out.   Room Tip: All rooms overlook the sea. See more room tips",1
"We stayed in the Andronikos for 3 nights in early August 2016 and it was perfect. Cristos and his team are very attentive throughout - provided great information on the lay of the land and all the top beaches and restaurants to visit. They also were great during every breakfast insuring we were satisfied with everything we needed. I highly recommend this hotel, it is within 15min walking distance to the town (they also provide shuttle service) and works out for couple and families as well.",0
"So glad we chose this hotel. Within walking distance of Mykonos Town & easy reach of all the fabulous beaches. The hotel itself is superb. Very clean, rooms very comfortable and it has a wonderful relaxed atmosphere. The food is excellent, the pool is lovely but what really makes this hotel something special is the staff, their hospitality and attention to detail. Nothing is too much trouble and they really do go above & beyond to make your stay very special.Top end of our budget but it was worth it. They will arrange everything for you, transfers, day trips or just provide easy transport to the beach or into town!Highly recommend Andronikos if you're heading to Mykonos. Wonderful hotel, wonderful location & wonderful people!",0
"The Andronikos is a perfectly situated hotel near town with incredible views of the island and those famous sunsets. The service was exceptional and the staff was the most attentive I have ever experienced in years of traveling, arranging great excursions, offering wonderufl suggestions for activities and dining, and just offering us a welcoming and inclusive vibe. We were a group of 4 and we had a blast, off and on the property. I highly recommend this hotel - great value for a 5-* experience. Minas was the best.   Room Tip: we were not poolside but I imagine it may be a bit more active than the rooms which are set back. See more room tips",0
"Will certainly only stay at this hotel going forward in Mykonos. The hotel was modern, very clean, and the service was incredible. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were always very helpful.",0
"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel, which is an excellent ‘all-rounder’. It is a short, downhill walk to Mykonos Town; there is also the free shuttle service in the evenings. The taxi back only costs about 5 Euros (2016).Our room was comfortable, clean and a good size. The breakfast was also very good and had a lot of variety. We particularly liked the Greek yoghurt & honey, baklava and fresh melon.There is plenty of space around the pool, including many loungers and benches. There are two bars, one by the pool and one on the upper floor that has a lovely view over the town and out to sea.We have seldom been in a hotel with such kind and helpful staff. Anna, Angelis, Illias and Meike at reception helped us book taxis, plan excursions and gave useful advice about the island. They were very welcoming and helped make the hotel such a charming place to stay.",0
"Amazing place amazing stay, perfect holiday, we are coming back to this hotel year after year, this was our fifth time.This hotel has something that I can not describe. From typical myconian white architecture, peaceful location just outside town, perfect attentive professional staff, beautiful and modern rooms, nice rich breakfast, to special vibe around pool and bar area. We also saw some regular guests coming back every year. Reception staff will fulfil all your wish, they will arrange everything for you, rent a car/bike, transport around island, reservation of dinner tables in restaurants and sunbeds on beaches, try really try above expectations. We will come back again next year. Sixth time,   Room Tip: cocoon rooms are beautiful See more room tips",1
"I can not fault this hotel at all! We really had the best time. The staff made our holiday so special. We left feeling like VIPs!Our 'Blue Room' was fantastic! Everything at Andronikos had a really love feel about it, so relaxed and beautiful. We really hope to be back soon.   Room Tip: The hotel is so clean and tidy, I imagine all rooms are perfect! See more room tips",0
"Not only were we greeted with both equal amounts of friendliness and professionalism, but the staff at this hotel just could not do enough for us. From the cleaners to the owner himself, everyone was friendly to the point you were treated like an old friend. The rooms are immaculate and modern. The saltwater pool and spa facilities are fab and I enjoyed a wonderful facial which made my skin feel great for days, even after the sun bathing! The food is great within the hotel, though the menu is fairly small and could do with a change between the lunch menu & evening to bring it up to the level of the rest of the hotel. Though a limited menu, the food is well prepared and tasty so hats off to the chef & cooks. The breakfast was gorgeous and there was masses of choice between traditional Greek dishes and continental, along with a hot menu with beautiful fresh ingredients and produce.I would highly recommend this hotel and be thoroughly confident you will love your stay.",0
"To echo the other reviews, I truly do not know how to begin how to describe how incredible our stay was at this hotel. To begin with, the pool area is amazing- it is a great area to have a couple coctails and enjoy the pool, which is saltwater and such a nice treat. IWe have never felt so at home- the staff all deserves 5+ stars. Beginning with check-in, Anna and her staff were beyond attentive, making sure that your stay was above your expectations. They offered wonderful recommendations on food/places to see and made sure to describe why they liked cetain places. Minas was hands down the best manager I have ever experienced. Throughout the week, we spent a good amount of time getting to know him, his story, his affiliation with the hotel and the passion that he has for it. On our last night, we were out a liitle late in the evening, and Minas was aware that we were leaving the next morning. Although we did not call for a wake-up call, he personally called our room to make sure that we were awake and to see if we needed anything. It is small touches like that that make me want to come back time and time again.The bartenders are also fantastic. I asked for a special drink, to surprise me. And it was incredible- a unique mix of ingredients, not something off the menu. And guess what, the next night, another bartender made me the same drink- they must have discussed how much I liked it! Truly the staff goes out of their way to make sure that your stay is unforgettable.Great location and close to town, you can definitely walk. Overall, you cannot go wrong with booking this hotel and you will not regret it! We will be back!",0
"My first trip to Mykonos and certainly not the last - based on the excellent stay at the Andronikos.Where to start?All staff are extremely friendly, know your name(s) within the first day, and are discretely attentive.They can organise hotel drivers to and from airports at any time of the day or night. This is very useful if you do not feel like the walk to into Mykonos Town (15 to 20min). You could rent a quad bike or scooter or car: there's plenty of parking space.Food and drink, laundry, tourist tips on the towns and beaches, whatever; staff seemed to be there all the time. No matter how late or early, there was someone to sort out any wishes or queries.As with Athens hotels, there is not a huge amount of TV channels. BBC World News was enough for me to know that the World hadn't stopped (and if you go to Mykonos for the TV...)Food and breakfast are awesome. The chefs are excellent. I did not ask for speciality food, but am sure that they could mix up anything. There are a number of veggie dishes on the menu for those interested. Breakfast is perfect.The Pool is saltwater and always crystal clear, cool and refreshing. There are loungers all round the pool - more than enough for all visitors. Towels are provided and chilled music akin to Cafe del Mar or a local variant plays discretely, never too loud for conversation on the covered, open lounging area. Large, quality towels are, of course, provided for all.What else?The Spa: Excellent. Alex is skilled and very professional. There's an excellent range of services from what I saw. My opinion: everyone should have at least the 'After Sun' or any other spa treatment. You'd never regret it.Sunset deck: Full bar services and an unobstructed view of the panoramic sunset. Nothing like sitting on the curved seats sipping your cocktail choice watching that sunset before dinner.The service was, in my opinion, better than many 5-star hotels I have stayed at around Europe and the States and I am already planning my next stay.The staff at Andronikos have made my holiday a Best holiday. Thank you!   Room Tip: All rooms are double glazed and have shutters. There is not much noise, but I found it nice. All sui... See more room tips",0
"We had an absolutely amazing, memorable stay at Andronikos! All staff were incredibly attentive and were on hand to help at all times. Minas the food and beverage manager was incredibly friendly, supportive and would do absolutely anything to help you. He was always on hand to greet us and made our stay ever so pleasant. Anna at reception provided us with much information about where to go and what to do. She was always on hand to provide recommendations and offer her services. The bar and pool staff were so very friendly and helpful! The rooms were nice and cleaned adequately. We had such a lovely, comfortable stay and will most definitely be returning! Thank you to all the staff for such an amazing holiday! You made us very happy!! :)",0
"After reading the reviews, we were expecting the service to be great but it even exceeded our expectations! Every single person we met from the owner who greeted us, the drivers, the reception, the bar / restaurant manager / staff, cleaners etc were all spot on. Nothing was too much trouble, we were definitely looked after yet we had our own privacy. 5* Service. We had a Cacoon Room with a sea view. The view was stunning! Perfect sunset view. The room itself if I honest was a little disappointing (it was on the small side and as it was all white, the floor did look dirty but not sure if this is just wear&tear apposed to being dirty). We had come from Santorini where for the same price we had a suite and was spoilt by the size. Service and the pool area with its bar / restaurant is what really makes this place special. The pool is sea water and a perfect temperature. The beds are comfortable with music playing that creates a wonderful atmosphere. There was waiter service to the beds and you felt really looked after. There was also little surprises throughout the day (like cold wet face towels and frozen grapes). We had a wonderful 5 days here and can not wait to book our next trip.",0
"I'm not sure where to start or to say what has not already been said about this hotel and its wonderful staff! Simply the best hotel we have ever stayed at! The Superior Room was brilliant...the amenities incredible and the service was out of this world!!Yes, it is expensive but that is Mykonos and you will leave knowing that the experience and friendships was worth every penny and much more!It's a long way but we can't wait to return again and very, very special thank you's to Minas, Maaike, Anna, Ilias, Angel, Takos, Tasos, George, Dimitris, Christos and all the incredible staff at Andronikos!",0
"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The staff make you feel so welcome and like family. Nothing is too much to ask from them! The housekeepers do an amazing job with the room too. The only down side is, apart from all the amazing staff there was one very angry receptionist. We were waiting for the shuttle in reception and you could hear him yelling at staff members, people on the phone and just at himself. We were soooooo uncomfortable and shocked after meeting so many other nice people there. He was slamming the phones down, throwing things, yelling, pacing around, demanding things off people - right in front of us too! My goodness someone did not wake up on the right side of the bed. 5 stars though because everyone else you come across is so helpful! We loved it here, never wanted to go home.",1
"The hotel staff were amazingly friendly and very helpful, everyone was very welcoming and happy, the only thing i didn't like about the hotel was how small the rooms were and that room floors were not very clean The hotel location is perfect and close to everything, plus they have a shuttle service to the old port which is very helpful I loves staying in this hotel and i would defiantly stay there again",0
I have been to Mykonos a few times now and have tried different hotels each time. Andronikos is easily the best I have stayed at in terms of customer service and atmosphere. The pool area is large and the salt water pool offers amazing respite from the hot Mykonos sun. I will definitely stay there again next visit to Mykonos.,0
"We have just returned from our 4th stay in Andronikos Hotel. Why do we keep returning? It is a perfect location to base a stay in Mykonos, Only a short walk from the bustle of the town, we love the hotels unique style, the superb Sky Bar for sunset drinks, the relaxed pool and bar area where nothing is too much trouble for the staff.and the hotels Lady Finger gourmet restaurant is better than ever this year.Minas has a great team! Thanks again to everyone for making our stay special once again. Look forward to returning as we surely will.",0
"We stayed at the Andronikos Hotel for the second time, from July 5th-16th, and once again had an amazing stay. The hotel sits hilltop approximately 5 minutes from town by Quad and ten minutes from the airport. The location is perfect: close enough to the action but far enough away to escape it. The staff deserves specific praise, in particular Minas, who was pitch perfect in his suggestions for beaches, restaurant and bars. His warmth and hospitality were matched only by his ability to gauge the type of places and crowds which suited our taste. And he wasn't alone: Miika, Vicky, Andreas, Panagiotis, and George were all faultless in their service and charm. As for our room, we stay in the ""Cocoon rooms"", which have rounded forms, ambient light and whitewashed walls. The rooms are well appointed, clean and ample size, though the wardrobe space could be refigured. Turndown service and housekeeping were excellent. Like most hotels in Mykonos, the Andronikos has a lovely hilltop view of Mykonos town and the coastal sunset, which can be viewed for the hotel's elevated sky bar. The pool area has plenty of sun beds and umbrellas and the salt water pool is large and deep. Service for drinks and food at the pool is prompt and the adjoining hotel restaurant serves excellent food. The hotel expanded their sun bathing area recently so there is plenty of room for guests/guests of guests to lounge.As for Mykonos itself, its a very special place. Our favorite beach spots on the island were Paranga (and its adjoining club Scorpio for drinks), Alemagou (for a relaxed bohemian vibe...) , Fokos/Ptelia (for more isolated stripped down beauty), and Super Paradise/Pinky Beach/Jackie O's (for Casual beach fun....). I highly suggest taking a quad/moped, a map, some water and your camera and simply venturing out. The roads are simplified and rustic but its difficult to get lost. There are dozens of vistas and beach alcoves off the beat and path with small family restaurants that serve incredible fish and mixed drinks. The northern part of the island is quiet and less populated, a welcome respite from the clamoring crowds of Mykonos town and the southern beach resorts. It's a balancing act: experiencing both enhances both. And though we drank our fair share we never felt drunk as we were active and stimulated.....Mykonos town is a labyrinth of small boutiques, restaurants and bars, from the regal to the casual. There are virtually dozens of restaurants on the boardwalk and Little Venice that are postcard perfect. The Greeks are a warm, hospitable affectionate people who understand irony and sarcasm. We met some truly lovely people. And Mykonos is a mixed environment: straight/gay, affluent/working class: everyone mills together and amongst one another............. as it should be.All in all, our vacation was nearly perfect. I have truly resented returning to New York, but considering the state of world affairs, that isn't a surprise. Our stay at the Andronikos felt like another universe, and that is what a vacation should be: pure relaxed, inspirational escapism.....I highly recommend both the Andronikos and Mykonos for your next vacation.....:)",5
"It was a great experience staying at this hotel! staff was excellent and services was quick, very friendly and helpful! Located quite center 10mins walk to little venice and 5mins to the airport by car! 10mins from the main walking street near little venice.Recommended",0

We had such an incredible stay at Andronikos for our honeymoon! The staff was phenomenal and extraordinarily helpful with all of our requests. We had such an amazing time that we ended up booking with their sister hotel in Santorini- we can't wait to spend the rest of our time in Greece with these fantastic hosts.,0
"The week we spent here surpassed all expectations . The location is perfect , we had beautiful rooms and the food was amazing . The best thing however was the staff at the hotel - each and every staff member was friendly , helpful and professional and we could not have asked for better or more personalised service . Highly recommended !",0
"Had an amazing stay in this hotel.The staff were super friendly accommodating to all your request.providing your stay to be memorableChristos was super nice and attentive and helpful which is unusual in travel destinations at peak times to have this kind of treatmentWe had a great stay in two rooms, and the big blue room is a must stay room.We were lucky enough to be given that room. and i will not forget how nice i was treated,Mykonos is a usual destination for me, and now i know for next time where to call home.Thanks Andronikos hotel and the best staff fully recommendedGreat pool, great service, nice sea views, and close to the best this island offers",0
"We booked this hotel last minute based on the location & reviews of the service. After not having great service in Cyprus this was a great way to be treated at the end of our trip. The staff are lovely, welcoming & helpful. Hotel is beautiful, stylish & comfortable. Located a short walk from town, but a shuttle available at night. The only down side was leaving! Highly recommend this place and would definitely come back if we ever get to return to Mykonos.",0
"Rooms are big and clean, mopped every day. The pool is great and relaxing at the pool is delightful with free towels and all sorts of extras handed out by the staff, like aloe vera cream, chilled towels and frozen grapes. Perfect ambiance... The food is good (great chorzo and canneloni) and very reasonably priced (for Mykonos). The breakfast is also good and comes with a wide variety of bread, eggs, yogurts, fruits and patisserie.The location is ok. It's just outside mykonos town. A 5 minute stroll down the road. Located on a small hill the skybar gives a very beautiful view on the sunset. Bus stop and small market is around the corner. But what makes Andronikos stand out is the friendliness of the staff. Really great team! Definitely recommended.",1
"A stay at the Andronikos is home from home, boutique style, laid back personal. Good location just 12-15 minutes walk from Mykonos town. Great restaurant onsite (Greek with modern twist). Staff are good humored and welcoming.",0
"The highlight of staying at Andronikos is the service. Minas and his team are exceptional in every way. Certainly the best service I've ever had in a any hotel. The hotel and its facilities are superb. My favorite part being the sunset bar where we collected each night. 10 minute walk to Mykonos Town (Chora). 5 minute drive from the airport, the hotel will organize transfers for 7 euros pp. Now stop reading and book it!",0
"Words cannot describe the perfection of our stay at Andronikos Hotel for our honeymoon and for my birthday !Staff were excellent, attentive and genuinely loved their job. From Minas who manages the pool / restaurant and Bar area and who was brilliant ensuring to make our stay unforgettable . A very special thx for the special birthday Surprise.It was Perfect !!! and another thx to Theo ..To Anna , Elias and Vasilis at the reception who were very helpful and always smiling :) and not to forget the driver and Vulent To Maaike and Christos who were also perfect by making our honeymoon exceptional ! Thx for upgrading our room it was adorable !!.Great selection for breakfast.French toast and the eggs Yummyyy ! thx to Vicky and Dimitris as well Sky bar was awesome with some really nice tunes. Definitely recommended it to anyone considering staying in Mykonos. Will not be disappointed! We felt like home .Thx Guys you Rock !!!   Room Tip: Any room would be great , an ATV is a must to see the whole island See more room tips",0
"Loved this hotel during our week stay on our honeymoon. Staff were excellent, attentive and genuinely loved their job. Minas who manages the pool / restaurant area was brilliant ensuring all guests thoroughly enjoyed their stay. We had breakfast by the pool area every morning! Great selection for breakfast. Pool area was awesome with some really nice chilled out tunes, nice sun loungers and bar. Found it hard to leave for the beaches. Easy stroll in to town in evenings for sunset drinks by little Venice or main squares for dinner or both most evenings. Rooms were very nice with comfortable beds. Definitely recommended it to anyone considering staying in Mykonos. Will not be disappointed!",0
"I never review hotels but this hotel is probably one of the reasons why I loved Mykonos so much. The service was flawless. Each and every member of staff was so helpful. The rooms were clean and tidy and very modern. We had a late flight on our final day however we had to check out at 12. The hotel staff allowed us to use a spare room until we had to leave for our flight. Going the extra mile means I would definitely come back and stay at this place. Waiters around the pool regularly check on all hotel guests, breakfast was great, reception helped with activity/restaurant recommendations. Hotel is 10 minutes from airport. Short walk from Mykonos town.",0
I loved this hotel. The staff were amazing and always greeted their guests by name and provided excellent tips of things to do while in Mkyonos. Would highly recommend staying here if you're interested in going to Mykonos.,0
"Great location, great facilities and great hospitality! They have the most amazing team of people, no other place I could say and feel from home to home except Andronikos! Nothing is too much hassle for them, they spent time to talk to me, I felt so comfortable being a solo traveller. Their maids were amazing, not only they tidied my room (I was super messy), folded all my clothes, they could even tell which were my sleep wear (just t shirt and shorts) and laid them neatly on the bed! If their services weren't exceptional I don't know what is?! Thank you for the warm and welcoming hospitality.",0
"I will keep this short and sweet.Attention to detail fantastic, the staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to make sure we had a brilliant holiday.I have been to '5 star' hotels where the staff are simply arrogant whereas, this place have staff far better than most of the 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Rooms are lovely, hotel is kept spotless, breakfast is fantastic with good bacon, sausage and eggs cooked every day to order (included in room rate). The beer is rather expensive, however I honestly didn't mind paying for it as everyone was so lovely. The Lady Finger restaurant was also very nice but again, slightly on the expensive side- It's certainly good for the night of arrival with welcome drinks from the lovely Minas. (got to thank all the other staff that we saw the most of- Teo, Minas, Dimitris etc etc).I can honestly say, I will be retuning to Mykonos and the Andronikos hotel- Keep doing what you are doing guys and try and keep the same staff. If affordable, I will come back this year in September, if not, see you next June!! If anyone checks out this review, just go ahead and book it because you won't be disappointed. TIP: If you want to be adventurous and travel around the island to different breaches like we did/ Mykonos town , make sure you rent a quad bike. We managed to bargain down to 100 euro for the week and it got us everywhere. This is also cheaper then getting taxis everywhere and car rental- I would avoid car rental at all costs because you will struggle for parking anywhere near Mykonos town.",0
"Lovely hotel, situated just outside Mykonos town but close enough to walk in on an evening. Taxi back required though as its uphill on the way back. The staff here are very helpful and friendly and can't do enough for you. My room was lovely with excellent air con. Only negative was that the shower soaked the toilet seat because of how it was positioned. The pool is fantastic and a great temperature. I had an amazing stay and I will be back",0
"We stayed at Andronikos for two nights and our experience was absolutely amazing. The first thing you would notice at the hotel is their outstanding service. The staff made efforts to remember everyone by their first name which gave a personal touch. Especially Ilias and Minas (F&B manager) were fantastic and gave us suggestions on good places on the island. We got a free upgrade to a sea view room upon arrival which was a pleasant surprise. The hotel is located about 10-15 min walking from the town but you can easily rent a vehicle or use the local bus service to get around the island. Overall, our experience was fabulous and we would definitely go back to the hotel.",0
"I stay in Andronikos hotel every middle of May and June about 12 years. This is not just a hotel. This is so friendly with the customers where no else I met so kind and Hospitallity owner and the stuff. Every year I meet the same people from whole Europe so all of us we became friends. During the years Andronikos he made construction to his room. All of them are now brand new. The food is excellent because he is using first quality to the products. I just want to say a huge thank you Markos Andronikos (he is the owner ), and his stuff which is so many years with him and never cross the line between customer and friendship. All of them they are there for anybody or for what you need. Also every year he puts more facilities for the customers. Anyway because I like him and his hotel so much I can talk for days. So I stop here until next year. All of us to be healthy and happy and stay in Andronikos. Love u guys Amalia",0
I stayed in Andronikos Hotel for 3 days and I really enjoyed it. It is located only 5 min away from the airport and another 5 min away from Mykonos town. Ideally located in the center of the roads towards many of the famous beaches of Mykonos. We were upgraded to a cocoon room which was really clean and elegant. The staff of the hotel is really helpful and kind - one of the best I have seen and definitely make your stay a lot better. I truly recommend it.,0
"My wife and I used Andronikos Hotel for our stay in Mykonos and absolutely loved it. From the time we arrived till the time we left the staff was amazing. The hotel itself is more modern and exactly what I was looking for to relax. Mostly couples and young adults with no children which made relaxing by the pool easy. The morning breakfast was delicious and had lots of options. I'd like to personally thank all the staff for making my trip so amazing. Love, Johnny and Becky   Room Tip: Ask for help renting an ATV or Scooter, where the best beaches are and food. See more room tips",0
"could not get over how friendly all the staff were, from the second we arrived till we left(2 weeks later). loved every min of our stay there and will be returning hopefully very soon. the food was some of the best we tasted on the island and spent many a day by the pool enjoying the greek sun. the sunset bar, class beautiful sunsets and good company",0
"We can't thank the Andronikos enough for looking after us so well during our stay. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week, the hotel was beautiful and modern, very clean and had a great pool and sky bar. Breakfast was fast service and a wide choice, and the pool area was relaxing with plenty of beds and parasols. Location is less than 10 minutes walk from Mykonos Town.So many great points to this Hotel but by far the staff made our stay so special. We'll be back!",1
"I don't write many reviews unless the location is excellent. The Andronikos Hotel was above and beyond excellent. The hotel rooms, location.food and employees were fantastic. The location is spotless and a short 15 minute walk into town. The employees were incredibly nice and very helpful. They all called you by name and remembered everything about conversations you had with them during the time of our stay. Definite five star location! Try the Big Blue room if you get the chance to visit. Beautiful!",0
"We got married in Santorini, Mykonos was our choice for honeymoon and we absolutely fell in love with it. Andronikos Hotel is superb, we cannot fault it, it exceeded our expectations. The staff made us feel very special during our stay. We loved it so much we have already booked to return in September. Greece is always our favourite holiday destination but this is our all time favourite and I think we will be coming here for many years to come. Thank you so much to all the staff at Andronikos.",0
"I was originally sceptical of the reviews related to service. Initially I thought it could be a little fake but after one day I realised it was genuine follow up service, day after day. Nothing is a problem for them and they make life easy. The hotel is not perfect and the rooms do not have the perfect design or construction standards but it is all workable and the ambience and service make the difference.The location is hard to rate because it depends what you want. It's not a safe walk to town in either direction but it's normal for Greek island standards. Nothing seems too ordered so be careful. But the location offers a great view and you probably will explore a different beach every day so the location becomes much better.100% I would and will return.",0
"Nice place ... Lovely hospitality, helpful staff and personalised attention... Had great time ... Stayed for 3 nights and experienced the best of the food, pool & ya lastly but not list amazing bar ... They call it sky bar .. Awesome veiw from thr of the city and sunset both",0
"This is our 6th day in beautiful Mykonos, our stay here at Hotel Andronikos has been wonderful. I am nearly 6 months pregnant so we decided to book a last minute week away before our new arrival comes and I am extremely pleased we booked this hotel.We have to start with the staff because they truly make this hotel worth the visit! Minas and the entire team are so friendly, not a single member of staff doesn't make you feel special! Everyone makes sure you are so well looked after and ensure you have the perfect stay. You will feel very welcome and comfortable here. Truly 5 star service from all of the staff and you will see this for yourself if you visit! The hotel itself is beautiful, very clean and a gorgeous refreshing salt water pool. Plenty of comfortable sun-beds, umbrellas and gorgeous views! The roof top bar has the perfect view of the sunset, truly the most relaxing setting. The pool bar is fabulous! Andreas and the other bar staff are brilliant, making the BEST cocktails for my husband and I had the best Mocktails so it made me feel truly in holiday mode even whilst pregnant! Location wise you couldn't ask for more! So close to the airport yet you cannot here the aeroplanes at all! 5 minutes from Mykonos town - You can walk , taxi , hire quads etc so many ways to get around town and visit the different restaurants, shops and bars. Minas will help recommend places to visit and can give you great ideas on different spots to eat and drink. The hotel restaurant is lovely!! Great food and the Desserts are amazing! The honey glazed doughnuts and Chocolate Mousse are my favourites! Breakfast was fresh with a great selection of cooked breakfast , pastries , fruits etc. We looked forward to breakfast every morning! Vicky and the team always make sure you have plenty to eat and the perfect cups of Tea & Coffee. The weather has been amazing every day! When you chat to other guests you don't hear a single bad word about this hotel, so many people are here on return visits and have stayed many many times at this hotel That is a sign of just how great the staff and hotel are. In the afternoons they bring round lovely cold aloe Vera and cold refreshing towels which is so lovely in this hot weather. Not to mention the staff remember everyone's names! So you're always welcomed by your first name which is amazing considering they meet so many new faces every day. The rooms are lovely and clean, the beds are comfortable and nice big bathrooms. Good hair dryers and a lovely shower. All in all we have had the best time and would definitely return again. Thanks to all the staff for making this such an enjoyable trip.Kyla & James",0
"Hotel looks exactly as it is shown under Featured photos. Big swimming pool, great rooms, very interesting interior, stuff is very welcoming, breakfast is very tasty. It is also less than 15 minutes walk from Mykonos town. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have not even one complaint about it.",0
"I booked this hotel based upon the great reviews on TA and I was not disappointed!! There are many pro's about this hotel, but let's start with the stand out factor and that is the staff! It felt like every member would go out of their way to help you with whatever you may need. They remembered everyone's name and greet you like old friends and by the time you leave, it really does feel like you are leaving friends behind. When we arrived, we were given a free upgrade to a Superior Deluxe Room (Room 501 - great tucked away location at the back, so don't get any noise from the pool area and it seems as if most of the rooms had it's own front entrance/porch with table and chairs set out which was a nice touch). Hotel is modern and very clean, and our room was really spacious with it's own living area. The bed was large and comfortable, however we found the sheets a bit annoying as it was just a single sheet and a thicker blanket on top, which kept getting twisted together. Another small annoyance was the shower had a hook in the middle of the bath tub, which meant if you hooked the shower head on, then the water would spray everywhere and the bathroom floor would get wet. There is a glass shower door but it only covered one side of the bath, so wasn't very helpful. That being said the bathroom was lovely, large and clean with great water pressure and constant hot water.The pool is one of the largest in Mykonos and has large comfortable sun beds. We went in the 2nd week of June and there was always enough sun beds for the number of people in the hotel. The pool is lovely, but we went to a different beach everyday so didn't make much use of the hotel pool. The water is cold (as is the sea) but it's bearable and refreshing on a hot day!The bar to the side of the pool is headed up by Thaikos (aka Mr Jones). He is such a great character and makes the best cocktails I've tasted!! He will remember all your preferences and then make the drinks better with his own touch! The hotel entrance is on a hill, which I had read was fairly steep which put some people off, but we did not find it a problem at all. We hired a car and there was always parking in the hotel entrance. The location of the hotel was great, it was 5 mins (by car, around 15 min walk) to get to Mykonos Town, and around 10 - 15min to the various beaches. I would definitely recommend hiring a car for the freedom to explore the lovely and plentiful beaches! Overall we had an amazing stay here and loved Mykonos! The staff could not do enough for you and really worth speaking to them for their recommendations as we found them to be very reliable and truthful. If we return, this will definitely be the only hotel option for us! Well done to the great team at Andronikos!!   Room Tip: I would opt for a room nearer the back of the bar/pool area so you don't get the noise from the... See more room tips",0
"Knowing that Mykonos is an expensive destination we were not surprised at the cost of the Andronikos.We expected mediocre facilities and service.``Reality could not have been more different.Our room was very pleasant, with a view to the salt water pool .The welcome and informative walk-around with one of the reception staff on our arrival was really pleasant and his enthousiasm was infectious.Our friends were not quite as pleased with their room, saying that every time they took a shower, the whole bathroom flooded.I saw several other Trip advisor contributors' comments regarding the te journey into Mykonos town.It is true that the 10 minute downhill walk is trecherous, due to lack of pavement, but we have had several instances when there was a delay in getting a taxi and the receptioist insited that their driver would run us down.This is over and above the normal scheduled times in the evenings when they do that anyway.The buffet breakfast was plentiful and good quality.Every single member of the team went out of their way to make our stay special.They remembered our first names, kept enquiring about our needs and offered personal opinions and recommendations on what to do and where to go. That is what really will stay with us, apart from the natural beauty of this lovely Greek island.One word of caution, the island is hilly and most places are built into the hillside,so this hotel is not recommended for people with mobility problems.",0
"Me and my husband stayed at the Andronikos Hotel in May for our mini-moon and it was brilliant. The staff are all so friendly and they couldn’t have been more helpful (nothing was too much). On arrival they helped us with our luggage and made us feel so welcome. Our room got upgraded to a superior sea view room (huge balcony and beautiful room) and the view was breathtaking (beautiful sunsets). As we landed a little late we had dinner and drinks in the hotel on our first night. The food at the Lady Finger restaurant was delicious and was a great start to our mini-moon. We received complimentary welcome drinks and the bar tender was amazing and truly talented at making cocktails (we went to the bar every night for a drink before heading into Mykonos town), we loved the ones he made from scratch which weren’t on the menu. Mykonos town is only a 10 minute walk away and full of lovely restaurants and bars. We always asked the hotel where they would recommend for dinner and they were always happy to recommend a restaurant (recommendations were brilliant). The hotel was also happy to help arrange a quad bike for us to explorer the island (a must - head to Kiki's tavern) and they were also great at giving suggestion on what to see.Overall Andronikos is a beautiful hotel and we would recommend it to anyone.We really enjoyed our stay and we hope to return in the future.Thank you Maaike and team for making our mini-moon amazing.",0
"Andronikos is a beautiful, modern and clean hotel with amazing rooms and views. Myself and my partner stayed here for 5 days and were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. On arrival the hotel staff took care of our luggage whilst checking us in. We were taken on a mini tour around the hotel and shown all the facilities by the staff and then seated at the bar/lounge by the pool area where we were served complementary drinks to welcome us. How lovely!!Our room was upgraded which was ever so nice and the staff were extremely polite and helpful. The staff provided a first class service, one that I have never experienced before. We were greeted each morning at breakfast, even around the pool area when we were lounging, whether it be drinks at the bar or just talking a stroll around the Hotel - we were always acknowledged by the staff.They helped us find our way around the island, recommended places to go during the day - various beaches, restaurants and even helped us hire a quad bike. I couldn't have asked for more during my stay here. Thank you to all the staff at Andronikos for a wonderful, happy, relaxed and extremely enjoyable experience. I will most definitely be paying another visit in the future and have already recommended Andronikos to many friends.",0
"1 week in paradise! Andronikos hotel is truly fantastic. We opted for the Cocoon room, which looked beautiful and luxurious in the photographs on the website, however in real life it was smaller and darker than expected. The mood lighting in the room was attractive, but not practical, is it was not bright enough for reading or putting make up on really. The bathroom facilities were fantastic, with two powerful showers in a large walk-in shower area. Don't expect any privacy in the bathroom though as there is a floor to ceiling window from the shower into the bedroom! We spent 4 days lounging by the tranquil pool, where the staff were so kind and attentive. While at the poolside, we ate from the ""snack"" menu, which was more like fine dining! Although the food from the menu was exquisite, it was slightly overpriced, with nothing on the menu under 10€ when all you're after is a sandwich or a salad in between swims. The staff at Andronikos are absolutely fantastic, they were so attentive, and could not to more helpful. Milas was so friendly, suggesting the most beautiful beaches, restaurants and bars that did not fail to impress us. Definitely worth asking him for suggestions rather than just winging it.Although the hotel is a 10-15 minute walk from town, I would recommend hiring a car or scooter for getting around if you want to explore the island and the beautiful, but remote beaches. Kali Livadi was undoubtedly the most beautiful beach, with soft sand and clear blue water. At 20€ per sunbed set you can enjoy table service in a peaceful spot steps from the waters edge. Thank you to all of the first class staff/family at Andronikos Hotel! We will definitely recommend the hotel to all of our friends and family, and we hope to see you again soon! Vanessa & Ben.",0
"We've just returned from ten nights at the Andronikos. I can honestly say it's the best holiday I've ever had. From start to finish, the staff were exceptional. The hotel grounds are lovely, a beautiful and classy hotel, which is suited to the island of Mykonos. We were greeted on arrival by Ilias- friendly and passionate to show you the hotel in which he is proud to work. We then had a welcome drink with Minas. Throughout our stay, Ilias, Minas, Christos and indeed the whole team could not do enough to help us and ensure the best possible holiday. The staff are knowledgeable about the island, and everyday at breakfast, Minas provided suggestions of where to explore on the island. Breakfast itself was lovely- a fresh array of Greek ingredients and the option for various egg recipes. The team all know you by name and never fail to smile. The pool is nice, with comfortable sun loungers scattered throughout. We genuinely never wanted to come home. Thank you Andronikos- we hope to be back.Sara and Andrew   Room Tip: Pool views are nice and the sunsets from the suites are amazing See more room tips",0
Andronikos hotel was fabulous. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Could not have asked for a better start to our holiday in Mykonos. Highly recommended hotel. Beautiful pool area and wonderful breakfasts. Town is about 10 minutes walk away and up a steep hill for your return so you might have to catch a cab back. We walked and it wasn't a problem. Beaches are a bus ride away starting in town and bus system works well So enjoyed our visit to Mykonos.,0
"We spent 4 nights at this great hotel. The staff could not do enough to help us throughout our time, making everything so easy and comfortable. We were even upgraded! Beautiful pool area, delicious breakfast with lots of variety, stunning views. It was really a special stay and we would recommend to anyone visiting Mykonos. The restaurant prices are a little expensive, but no problem as there are so many restaurants in the town area. The walk from town to the hotel was fine for us, but it is up a steep hill so that may be worth noting for those who aren't comfortable with a bit of a climb. Overall great experience.",0
"I stayed at the beautiful and stylish Andronikos with 4 friends in early June, after it was recommended by another friend. We all absolutely adored it and the staff were the best hotel staff I have ever met. They bent over backwards to cater to our every whim. The reception staff gave us lots of advice, and Minnos in the restaurant and Vicky our waitress were absolutely lovely. I wish I could remember the names of the other staff because they were all so brilliant.Two of us shared a superior room (sea facing) which was compact but well designed. Everything was exceptionally spotless and clean. The bathroom was big, the bed comfortable and there was lots of closet and storage space for our huge amount of clothes. The small refrigerator was on its last legs though and could probably do with an upgrade! There was also a lovely private outside area which we used each evening for drinks before we left for dinner, and was perfect for photographing the sunset.The hotel about 10-15 minutes downhill on foot from Mykonos town, which made it easy to walk down for dinner each evening (also there is a free shuttle at 8 and 9 each evening too). Then road to town is quite busy though so be careful and walk against the traffic! Breakfast was great - fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, breads, and eggs to order. The huge pot of praline was a favourite of our group.The pool area is well designed and the loungers comfortable, but like anywhere I recommend getting down early to grab your beds. The pool bar is well stocked and the prices are London prices (about 12e for a cocktail and 8.5e for a gin and tonic) but I think that's standard for this very stylish island.There is a small gym which I used a few mornings and it's perfect for a quick run before breakfast.Our only criticism is that the bar and restaurant food was pretty expensive (15e for a club sandwich etc) which is why we tended to eat out more. I think a few more standard menu items for lunch would be helpful. The hotel also has a beautiful sunset/sky bar that is great for a pre dinner drinks and the perfect place to take photos. All in all we absolutely loved this place and will 100% be back. Missing it already!",0
"What can I say this is been one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had traveling the world. I have never seen such a genuine well trained staff with such authentic kindness and hospitality! The hotel staff single handedly set the bar for international hotel excellence! I arrived to Mykonos after 9pm to a friendly staff calling me by name before my introduction. The hotel: grounds, room, pool, balcony, breakfast, bar were are all impressive, but the hospitality is true excellence!! While in the states I was concerned about having an standard room so I chose to upgrade and upon arrival I was offered a complimentary additional upgrade to the best room on the property! No matter which room you chose you cannot go wrong at Andronikis. The location is perfect, close to anything you need:parties, town, secluded beaches you name it. This hotel will have my loyalty every time I or a friend return to Mykonos. After a long day of traveling we relaxed in our amazing room. The next morning walking down for breakfast I was greeted by name by the amazing restaurant staff!!! This was not just a hotel stay, Andronikis made this my home. 5 stars doesn't give this hotel justice. I have stayed in 5 star hotels around the world and none can compare. My warmest thanks goes out to everyone at Andronikis that helped make this the best trip for my girlfriend and I. We will certainly be back. Vicky, George, Anna, Minas, Illias, Angelis, Maaike, Christos and everyone else at Andrinkois thank you for setting the standard and leaving me wanting to come back to Andronikis to visit again!",0
"Cannot fault this beautiful hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating and couldn't do enough for you, offering lots of advice on the best places and restaurants to visit. The location was perfect, just ten minutes walk into town. The room was always cleaned impeccably and the food and service was faultless. Thoroughly recommend!",0
"The staff on this hotel could not have been any better! Other hotels should learn from them! Everything at our 4 days stay was just great. Good food, breakfast amazing and staff absolutely amazing! It was close to town with a shuffle service at 8 and 9 in the evening wich was great, even though you could walk downhills. We will absolutely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.",0
We had a wonderful one week stay @ Andronikos hotel. The room was spacious and came with a large balcony with pool-view. There is a rich breakfast included and the F&B team is just phenomenal!Also big thank you to the front desk team who made us feel welcome when we arrived and are always at your service.Ps. the wifi is super fast!,0
"I never write reviews... Ever. But this place is just so incredible I felt the need to share it with you all! First off, the place and the location itself are both amazing. We were upgraded to a cocoon room on arrival as a treat for my birthday which was so nice of them. On arrival you're shown around the hotel and given a welcome cocktail. The main talking point from the hotel, as many people have already written about is their staff. They are all unbelievable and couldn't do enough for us. They call you by name, which in itself is an achievement considering they have however many hundred guests.I'd like to point out individual staff members who were brilliant, but I can't single out anyone because every member of staff from the reception desk, the bar staff and all other parts of the hotel were just magnificent.I've recommended this place to all of my friends and family, and I urge all who read this review to go and visit the Andronikos Hotel. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!Jordan",0
Loved this hotel everyone was so kind and helpful had a little disaster and they were all there for me.Food good room lovely all beautiful xxBreakfast amazing pool lovely staff were amazing love you all will defo return to this beautiful place xxxx,0
"We can not say enough wonderful things about our stay at the Andronikos Hotel on the Island of Mykonos. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi the staff made every moment there relaxing, fun and memorable. You could tell they enjoy working there and are like their own family unit. They sincerely want to make certain you have a spectacular time while on your vacation/holiday with them. I am sure I have forgotten a few people but do want to mention: Minas the Hotel manager; Tikas the bartender; George the crazy waiter; and the Reception/Concierge staff--Maaike, Christo, Ignesgio and of course....Ilias (our ""Indiana"" friend). Thank you Andronikos--we will be back!",0
"From the moment I arrived the staff couldn't do enough to make me feel welcome and comfortable. Some of the friendliest people I have ever met! The room was incredible, with amazing views of the sea and the island of Tinos. As someone who works in the hotel industry myself, this hotel far exceeds anything other hotels can offer. I was a solo traveller so the hospitality of everyone who works here was much appreciated. Thank you to the whole reception team, Maaike, Vullnet, Christos, Angelis, Ilias, Anna and of course the amazing F&B team, Minas, Takis, Dimitris, George, Vicky and Tasos. I really hope I haven't forgotten anyone! You were all incredible so thank you so much for an unforgettable stay.",0
"Finding a hotel in a new place is always difficult!! After several readings and some cancellations I decided to book at the Andronikos.... Originally booked for 4 days I almost stayed a week!! If there is one main reason is about the team!! The team is may be the most welcoming ladies and gentlemen I ever met in my long travel life... It's a wow effect, they have the X factor for hospitality!!! Nothing ostentatious... Natural!!!Congrats to Cristos, Minas, Anna, Dimitris, Tasos, Theodoris etc.... Sorry I can't list all but they made my stay great !Of course the hotel itself is well located, rooms are moderns, the SkyBar is the spot at sunset in a cool chill out atmosphere, the restaurant snacks or lady fingers menus, the fresh veggies juices menu are making a great holistic experience, it certainly helps!!! But beautiful hotel without soul is just a place to sleep, eat.... Andronikos is a special place :it has a heart!!",0
After travelling frequently to Europe especially italy I thought hospitality is a forgotten concept till I landed at Andronikos. Well it was my wife's 40th bday and they upgraded me to a cocoon room. Maikaa was such a sweetheart ..I had a small wound on my foot which she wiped herself with betadine. .and bandaged it..my heartfelt thanks to her. Minaas was awesome. Everyday made us fresh juices foe breakfast and specially provide vegetarian dishes for us on the table. All the other staff..especially the girl on the Reception counter gave spot on suggestions for dining and partying. They arranged an eggless cake for my friends wife's bday which was on 28th. No words can describe the hospitality we have experienced there. Cheers to the entire staff !!!,0
"I've read though many reviews on here and hopefully this up to date review from people who are not in the least bit fussy might guide you to a decision upon staying there. 3 friends and myself travelled to Mykonos in the last week of May for 6 days. Upon arrival at the hotel we were a little taken back by the welcome received, as you are introduced to nearly EVERY person that works here - it became quite comedic and overwhelming - I'm sure if a cleaner or gardener had been walking past we would have been shaking hands with them both also! :) All four of us are more happy with just grabbing a key and settling in straight away upon our travels - no thrills or fuss needed - so this initial welcome and sunsequant tour that followed of the pool/bar/facilities/kitchen was a little grand, but we went with the flow. And I am glad we did. This initial welcome sets you up for the week, where you receive nothing but perfect, polite, efficient service from EVERY single member of staff. You never feel like you are pressured into anything, but on the other hand nothing will be too much trouble when you ask. We unfortunately were initially placed in a room that was directly postitioned next to the restaurant. and it smelt of the restaurant, so we asked be moved, and they immediately did so without hesitation. Immaculate service. As for the rooms - we chose a cocoon room - managed to get it for £640. Although the room is unique, it certainly doesn't live up to the beauty of the pictures advertised, but was still nice enough -albeit a little small. Had we paid the £1200 some websites were advertising we would have been BITTERLY disappointed - so word of warning on this front! Minas was the main man, always welcoming you to the bar and restaurant and worked very hard to make sure nothing was too much trouble for you - a really kind man whom you can't help but warm too. Alex provided a much needed massage - something I cannot reccomend highly enough if you have the time - and money. Slightly expensive at 100 euros - but it was a beautiful treat and well worth it. And that is the only downside really to Andronikas Hotel - the price. The food served was very nice, but was WAY too expensive compared to other eateries around the surrounding area. An open salmon sandwich for example was 14 euros - it was basically a slive of bread with salmon on it. Although tasty - a price of 8 euros would have been more acceptable for what was received. Is it more expensive because it's around the pool? of course, but in comparison to other hotels I have stayed in the past on an equal level it was most definately overpriced - something you will read continuously throughout the trip advisor reviews. As you do with respect to the position - it is a 10 minute walk into town along dusty unpaved roads - for us no trouble at all - but for elderly people may prove a struggle - but taxis are around 7 euros each way if needs be so not a problem. As for views - you can see the sea from a select amount of rooms - but the 95% of the hotel is surrounded by land and roads and other buildings, so don't be fooled by the picture of the seaview in some of the photos from the top bar - it is well photographed and slightly deceiving. Bottom line - I would most DEFINATELY stay there again - if anything as a thankyou to all the staff that made the experience so much more enjoyable, and are undoubtably the highlight of the hotel - but I would definately not pay the price that some websites advertise. Thankyou to Minas and everyone for such an enjoyable holiday - you were ALL wonderful - and we thankyou a great deal.",2
The staff at Andronikos is incredible. From the friendly hello's from each of them as you walk past to the way they treat each of their guests as if they were a VIP. Easily one of the best hotel experiences my wife and I have ever had. Its very difficult for me to stay somewhere else as my expectation have increased so much that i won't be able to adjust elsewhere.   Room Tip: pool view room should be your preference See more room tips,0
"What a great, warm welcoming when we arrived.And then, everybody we interacted with, whether the manager, the people supervising the breakfast, the people who delivered the room service, the cleaning ladies, the therapist, the bus driver, everybody gave us a 5 star service.",0
"My stay started with a warm pickup at the port. All the staff were wonderful and could not fault the level of service given. Every one remembers your name, which makes you feel like home. The hotels location is great with a short walk down the the hill to town. If I get the chance to visit Mykonos again this will be my first choice.   Room Tip: The pool view room could be a little noisey at night See more room tips",0
"Just to say we would rarely go back to the same hotel twice, why would you when there is always so much choice in every destination, however, last year we discovered this great place and felt we just had to return for another visit. The hotel itself is quite lovely, small enough to be recognised but large enough to still feel you have space to breath. Rooms and suites are simply furnished and spotlessly clean although not as 5* as some might expect but we have found this often the case in the Greek islands, it should not put you off a stay here. The upper floors to the front of the hotel have great views especially for the sunsets (although there is a great sunset bar for your viewing pleasure). The hotel for us is a perfect location just on the edge of Mykonos Town a 12 minute walk down hill in, a little longer to walk back up the hill after a couple of bottles of wine.What really makes this hotel stand out to us both are the staff that they have working for them, without exception each and every member of their team make you feel so welcome and give you such a positive experience your holiday begins the very second you enter this wonderful haven.I have worked in the hospitality industry and educate on the importance of exceeding the customer expectation, the team at Andronikos excel at this consistently on every day you spend with them. Rather than leaving at the end of great week thinking where we might stay next year, we left thinking quite simply thinking why would we stay anywhere else. Thank you to everyone for making us feel so fabulous for at least one week this year it is and was really appreciated..   Room Tip: Top floor to the front of the hotel have the best views but as there is a great sunset bar. See more room tips",0
"I do not have enough words to describe how wonderful Hotel Andronikos is! If you find yourself in Mykonos, do not bother looking for any other place and head straight away to Andronikos. The staff is extremely friendly, always cheerful and greeting you with smiles and they address you with your first name. I wonder how they manage to do it. We were so taken aback because they even managed to pronounce our Indian names,Priyanka and Saurav correctly! They gave us a free upgrade to their big Blue room and it was simply fabulous. Such a lovely room. There was a bottle of wine and fruits waiting for us in the room as well, both complementary. On arrival, we were given a tour of the entire hotel and also a welcome drink which was delicious. Anna at the reception did all she could to arrange for whatever sightseeings we wanted to do in Mykonos. The hotel sent us a detailed email about all that we needed to know about Mykonos. The pool area is lovely. We spent one whole day just lying about on the beach beds, sunbathing and enjoying the blue skies and sunshine. The pool is nice and huge. The spa is also good. I indulged in a full body massage and it was amazing. Alex at the spa gave my husband a complementary 10 minute foot massage. Andronikos is full of surprises! On check out we were informed that they didn't even charge us for the pick up from the port which was otherwise 7 euros per person! We have been to so many hotels but never have we encountered one like this! They have set such a huge benchmark and I know I'll end up comparing all the future hotels I stay in to this one! The buffet breakfast was superb! So many options to choose from and you can order eggs the way you like them and they will do it in perfection. On our entire 22 day Europe trip, I enjoyed eating breakfast here the most and they managed to make the omelet just the way I like it. A huge shout out to the entire team of Hotel Andronikos! Each and every member does his/her best to ensure that the guest is 100 percent satisfied with everything. Thank you so much Christos, Maaike, Anna, Alex, Dimitris, Minas. I'm sorry if I'm forgetting anyone else but all of you were lovely and you made our stay such a memorable one. If you're planning to go to Mykonos, just close your eyes and choose this hotel and trust me you'll be glad you did! And book a room through their website and they'll give you better offers. Thank you for such a lovely experience, Hotel Andronikos!",1
Loved staying at the Andronikos. This hotel is in a great location as it is walking distance from town. The service is great here and everyone really tries to make you feel welcome and provide you with any help that they can. Everyone knew us by first name and always tried to help. Minas was exceptional as he made us feel like we were at home. I would definitely stay here again !,0
Myself and a friend stayed at the Andronikos in May. On arrival we were met by friendly helpful staff. As we were staying out of season the staff upgraded our room. The hotel was clean and staff were always happy to help. Staff make a point to remember your name which is a nice personal touch. The location of the hotel is about a 15 min downhill walk into town. Minas the bar and restaurant manage was extremely friendly and made sure all our needs were met. Would definitely recommend people stay here.,1
"Our room was superior and was very accommodating for 3 people. Very clean and comfortable and loved the patio that allowed us privacy while enjoying the pool view as well as overlooking the town.10 minutes walking distance to the town and restaurants, windmills and also enjoyed the sunset from the Hotel roof bar.The staff was excellent and very helpful with information and the food was great too. We enjoyed all that we ordered and the breakfast was fresh and delicious.",0
Thanks for the wonderful time. I really appreciated the fact that the hotel is not directly at the center of the city and that the hotel has it's own car park.The hospitality was at high standard and the room was in good shape. Many thanks again.,0
I was really amazed about the hospitality and excellent service of this hotel! Everything was simply perfect! In this hotel there are positive vibes everywhere! I used also the spa for a massage and i strongly reccomend to use it! Alexander that works in the spa is a very professional gye! Courteous and experienced offers massage of high standard.,0
"Just back from a week in Andronikos, as a solo traveler this place was perfect and I felt very safe. I had a standard room which was beautiful, contemporary and very clean. Very nice big bathroom with large walk in shower.Yes everyone in the hotel is very friendly and helpful and remember your name and would always acknowledge you, however this is just good marketing and excellent customer care which should be expected in this type of hotel, but yes, all are very professional and efficient. Pool area is really great, spent lots of time there, very relaxing, sea water pool is definitely a plus. What they call the ""snack"" menu is just really delicious, better than any other hotel I went to. Not sure about the loudness of the music sometimes in the bar and pool area, I thought it could have been slightly more in back ground, but maybe that is just me. Breakfast is just something to look for every morning, again so far the best I ever had in this type of hotel, you can take your breakfast by the pool if you wish, and any cooked breakfast is made to order and freshly prepared in the kitchen, lovely, not the usual unattractive pre-cooked stuff, these people are not afraid of hard work, it shows and pays of. Definitely a wonderful experience. Don't hesitate, give them a try, they deserve it.",0
"Simply the best!! Its our second time in the hotel, it scores a 100% the staff are all quite exceptional the location is perfect (5 minutes walk from the most amazingly unspoilt town of Myconos)The food in the hotel is up there with any top end New York or Paris bistro and the cocktails are made with flair and passion from there highly trained masters of fun.Loved every minute and will be back.Thank you.",0
"I have recently returned from a week's stay at Andronikos Hotel and I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. It is a cliche, however very true that they couldn't do enough for us. An example being after we had left for the airport, my son received a call to tell him he had left his door key in the safe and they had a member of staff bring it to the airport on a scooter and managed to have it passed through to him.We felt so at home and had a wonderful time in beautiful Mykonos Town.The journey into Town is a 10 minute walk but as is normal in Greece pavements are not a given so we got a cab each way, which was 5 Euros, not a problem!The breakfast was great, you could get continental selection - fruit, yoghurt etc., or local specialities or scrambled egg, bacon etc. All the staff were so friendly, helpful and polite it was an absolute joy to stay here and they made my 50th birthday holiday so happy and memorable and we definitely plan to return as soon as possible.Thank you Andronikos!",0
"The hotel offers a great service, good pick up service from the airport. We received a free upgrade to a suite, but overall the staff was amazing, really helpful and they are making your stay unforgettable. The suite was big with a beautiful terrace and very well cleaned! We can really recommend this hotel in Mykonos!",0
Very nice 4 day stay but booked during the busiest time of the year so the prices were high. Good location but about a 15 minute bus ride into the main area of Mykonos town. I'd stay in town next time. Be careful of the type room you book. According to their room descriptions the honeymoon suite is the same sq ft as the regular room. I couldn't tell any difference other then 200 euro more per night Opt for the junior suite over the honeymoon suite. Larger and cheaper I loved the hotel but not enough to book again.,0
We stayed in Mykonos at Nissaki for 3 nights. Overall amazing experience. Not ideal first night but the hotel was kind to love us considering it was our honeymoon. Stefanos was wonderful --such a great guy and bartender. Very accommodating staff overall.,0
"We had a great time at Nissaki. A really nice boutique hotel which was well designed, clean, friendly and with wonderful sea views. The service from all the staff was excellent, from the always helpful concierge Evangelia who booked us lots of nice restaurants and a wonderful sailing trip, to the friendly and skillful barmen Stefanos and George, Spyros and Francesca on front desk, all really warm and engaging with us all. Nice interesting mix of guests so good conversation at the bar and poolside. The children aged 16, 13 and 8 enjoyed meeting others their age and enjoying the pools, beaches and (for the eldest) the local nightlife. Thanks Nissaki!",0
"Beautiful, luxurious little hotel. From the beginning we were greeted by very friendly staff, and despite a little issue we had with one of the beds, everything else was just perfect. Food & drinks were super good, and the pool has a really nice view of the bay. You can have a caipirinha while overlooking the sea and bay area =). Our room was HUGE, and there was this little patio connected to the hotel pool, which was awesome.",0
I stayed here with my family of 4. Children are >17. The location is peaceful and perfect to go anywhere in the island because the bus stop and water taxis are few meters down the street. It is between two world know beaches: fancy Psarous and Platis Gialos family beach. We set a towel on the beach for a while but then decided to enjoy the hotel pool and grounds with its spectacular view and the nicest personnel. The breakfast is out of this world with so many Greek delights and overlooking the ocean. We will definitely be back!,0
"Staff at the Nissaki are indeed exemplary, they provide consistent awesome service ! (Franchesica at the front desk is a gem )Location is walking distance to the beach with great ocean views , nice pool ,well maintained property. Lots of good restaurant options in walking distance, as well the bus service to the town is reliable and convenient , Its a tourist city so all the machinery is in place for visitors . My decision was a hotel in town or by the beach , I am glad we stayed by the beach away from the bustle and noise of the town. Mykonos is about nightlife, you need to decide if you want to be in the heart of it or on the outskirts with access to it.   Room Tip: Specify if you need suites with 2 showers vs suite with shower and bathtub. See more room tips",0
"We stayed for a few nights in July 2016 at this hotel. It was a lovely surprise upon arriving, with a contemporary modern reception and friendly welcoming staff to greet us. The ocean view room that we had was spacious, beautifully decorated and very clean. We were pleasantly surprised to also have our own outdoor area with lay chairs and table. The restaurant was on the beach and the food was beautiful. Lovely stay, wished we had longer to enjoy. Highly recommend!",0
"This Boutique Hotel was conveniently located. A short walk down the road was the bus stop which made it easy to access Mykonos Town in the evening. A little further down the road was another beach cove which offered water taxis to various beaches along the southern tip of Mykonos Island. The service at this hotel was exceptional. The staff truly tried to make every experience happen. Evangelia helped many times and also managed a last minute private sailing trip for our family with private transfers for this excursion. Apostolis, a server at the restaurant, was very personable with us. His service was exceptional and his friendly demeanor was enjoyable. He also gave us a great recommendation for dinner in Mykonos Town. The best Euros ever! Nissaki Boutique Hotel is a small hotel with great staff trying to make your stay the most enjoyable experience ever!",1
"Nissan is something really  different. ..the best boutique  hotel .. we love  it .. very good place  amazing food very good quality  of food..you have to visit this restaurant ""talatel  with  beef  filets"" Theo's  suggestion ... very  good staff with  a lot  of smiles. . And  helpful we stay in  room 507 very good room ... in our first night  we find a problem.. but the kids help us and everything  was perfect .. if you  have staff like theo you can't  afraid any  problem he was like multi machine. .. for  any problem. .. theo from bar theo from reception  theo from  everybody and the result? ? No  problem . .. the  only problem  is the taxi in mykonos  islands   are only 36 .. and privet  is a little  expensive.  So only by bus",0
"Excellent, from arrival until departure, professional, accommodating, friendly - the staff are what made our stay an experience, the hotel is fantastic, the views, the setting and the facilities but the staff are what create the memories, and the ones that you want to return to",0
"We stayed in this Hotel for few nights during our Honeymoon to Greece. The hotel is great, beautiful views, it is nestled between two great beaches and there are couple great restaurants walking distance. There is a bus stop very close to the hotel as well as couple markets to pick up little things like water and snacks. You can catch the bus to go see the town or you can even take the water taxi to explore other beaches. The pool at the hotel is awesome, the staff, the food and drinks are all great. There is a free wifi in the room which we were able to use by the pool also. The beds are very comfortable, the house keeping is there twice a day. The front desk has many great recommendation. A lot of younger people work there so we were able to find out about cool clubs and things to do that interest us. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and if I ever return to Mykonos I will stay at the NIssaki Boutique Hotel.",0
"I have the opportunity to travel quite a lot for both business and pleasure but it is unusual that an experience stands so clearly head and shoulders above the others. My husband and I spent 8 days in the beautiful VIP suite which is a must if you are looking for a high end romantic escapade. The room was heavenly, the view picturesque (except for the big motor boats that park in front of noisy Nannos beach, but not the fault of the hotel! And the double glazing was very good) The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly in a genuine way, concerned only that the clients have the best possible holiday and remembered us individually. Breakfast was varied, catering to all tastes and especially loved the freshly squeezed orange juice! We had several treatments at the spa. A holistic massage; relaxing massage; facial and pedicure and the staff and experience were excellent, with a great individual treatment.Our stay was so good, and we were so sad to leave that we booked a second week at the hotel at the end of August with our teenage kids which will be a different experience but I'm confident they will love it! A big thanks to everyone that made our trip so memorable.",0
"We are spending a couple of days at Mykonos and this hotel is beautifull very good food, wonderful view from our grand suite, the room is a two room suite big enough with the pool and ocean just outside the room, conveniently located walking distance from nice restaurants",0
"well kept, spacious room, a view of the harbor and a lovely salt water pool, helpful friendly staff who offered me a small candle as a gift for my stay.only down side is that nammos beach is on that bay so expect music blasting till 10pm at night, but it is in many Mykonos hotels",0
"Everything about this hotel is outstanding! Perfect location, nestled between two walking distance beaches, amazing views of yachts and close enough to Chora yet far enough for relaxation. The staff were very welcoming and made you feel as if you were family. Stefanos, the bartender was very personable, while Theo and Elena, just two of the great servers, were informative and all three receptionists were always there to assist. We spent 10 days there and would go back in a heart beat. To top it off the breakfast was good but dinner at the restaurant was out of this world with a beautiful view. The rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. Been to many five star hotels and this definitely fulfilled my expectations.",0
We spent 10 days in Greece on various islands. Nissaki hotel was by far the best hotel on our itinerary. Watch the yachts come in...convenient to walk to beaches and restaurants or nammos to party if you want yet quiet and sophisticated. Would go back in a blink. Close enough to Mykonos proper but far enough to be private. Don't forget to make reservations at Jackie Os ....you we will not be sorry you booked this fabulous property in an amazing location,0
"Beautifully designed, friendly staff! Magnificent views and right in the center of activity. Close to shopping dining and the beach! We only stayed one night but would have stayed longer. We would visit again.   Room Tip: Excellent views See more room tips",0
"Truly incredible from start to finish, absolutely stunning!Perfectly located hotel in between Platys Gialos and Psarou Beach.Incredible setting, gorgeous rooms, amazing service, just sensational in every sense of the word!",0
Truly a beautiful place with friendly and extremely helpful staff we had the most wonderful holiday here. Being high season it was difficult to get a taxi for seven people or when our friends left even for four people but if you willing to spend €50 one way to the more further way beaches then it was easy. We learnt quickly routes on foot to get to some beautiful beaches like Paranga. The staff at the hotel where amazing and really made our holiday easy and relaxing.,0
"We loved the location, the boutique style hotel and friendly staff.the position was great ,very easy to get around.We enjoyed being close enough to restaurants and beaches to walk everywhere or catch the bus into Mykonos town.",0
"Recently, I took my family for a one week stay at Nissaki Boutique Hotel in Mykonos. Our stay and experience was nothing short of magnificent. A perfectly located hotel in between Platys Gialos and Psarou beach which is well suited for family stays and those seeking comfort and style. What made our stay extra special was the friendly, professional and knowledgable staff at Nissaki Boutique Hotel.We quickly established good rapport and were assisted in many ways to make our stay pleasant.One particular member of staff, namely Spyros Panaretos, was a standout for us. Spyros carried a constant smile in his everyday duties, had a positive disposition and was always ready to assist us in gaining direction, advice and to help us embrace the authentic Myconian cultural experience.We have travelled extensively around the globe, and I must say Spyros was a top rated hospitality professional who will go places with his charm, his knowledge and desire to please the holiday-makers. Overall, a memorable experience for me and my family, that has left us with lasting impressions of a world-class destination!",1
"Great hotel with an excellent location. All amenities are great but what makes the experience excellent is the staff. All people working are very friendly, professional and helpful. Breakfast and food in general are excellent. Would certainly go back.",0
"This hotel was fantastic. The location is perfect as ALL rooms overlook Psarou beach. You are a short walking distance to Platys Gialos and Psarou Beach where Nammos is located. The hotel was recently renovated and the room we stayed in was an Elegant Suite consisting of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It truly was a very elegant suite.The service was absolutely brilliant and to be honest all the staff were amazing. In particular Francesca, Evangelia, George, Ilias, Apostolis, Theo, Spyro. There were so many others also. Francesca and Evangelia were always so happy and very attentive to everyone's needs. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels before, but this boutique hotel provides exception service, over and above these hotels. A job well done!The breakfast buffet was awesome with a lot of variety provided. We were leaving at 6.30am one morning and they organised to have breakfast delivered to our room. Something the hotel provided without us having to ask for it! Just brilliant.We loved our 9 day stay at this hotel and will definitely return in the future.   Room Tip: We chose the Elegant Suite which has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Large for a family and overlooked... See more room tips",0
"Amazing beautiful hotel .....perfect spaces doted round to enjoy the amazing view and a lovely breeze to keep you just right ..... Greeted everyday by Evangelia for a wonderful fresh breakfast , Theo couldn't do enough always a happy face and nothing too much trouble ,Spyros always a cheeky face and a welcoming smile . Stefano fabulous cucumber and rum cocktails !!!We are certainly returning can't wait Perfect balance between location , helpfulness and smart but not stuffy Love it ! Fiona and Andy",0
"a wonderful hotel in a wonderful city.room as described and very good service.rooms situated on the sea side give a spectacular view.my room was the number 533 and was very tidy and clean for all time long, stuff did a great work and if you got any questions or requires, just ask them!   Room Tip: also in the lower roof you can have a good bay view See more room tips",0
Amazing hotel and service. The team were incredible and went above and beyond. So friendly and accommodating. The food and cocktails were delicious! We would definitely recommend this place and will be back again without a doubt. Thanks Team Nissaki <U+2764><U+FE0F>,0
"Lived upto and beyond expectation.Great setting that looks over Psarrou Bay which has Nammos on its beach. Waking up, having a wonderful breakfast overlooking the yachts then lazing by one of the lovely pools was wonderful. The staff are fantastic and can't do enough to help you. You really feel catered for but not over interrupted. The location is great for access via bus 10 mins or taxi to the town or to the various beaches near by. Scorpios is 10To 15 minute beach walk too which is well worth a visit ( better for food, drinks and vibe) than Nammos. Really well worth visiting. The quality of the spa is great too. The massages are wonderful, the gym small yet functional and Elena who works in the Spa is fantastic. We took a look at the other establishments in the area while we were there and we genuinely think this has it over eg others Highly recommended for a visit.",0
"This is definitely the best place in Mykonos. Excellent location and amazing service. Special thanks to Spyros for his hospitality upon our arrival and all our stay. He was very helpful, welcoming and joyful. Extremely welcoming staff and well organized. They showed us where to go and how to have a good time. They also provided car transfers and transportation arrangements for us along with restaurant reservations. We would definitely come back here if we are back on the island.",0
"Superb service. Clean all over. We felt really relaxing. Beautiful view over the eagian ocean, specially from balcony. Special thanks to Francesca and Thomai at the reception, but also the male staff at breakfast and bar needs to be mentioned. The difference between 5-star and lower graded hotels are actually about reliable and quick service or not and not just about variety in food. Per/Norway.",0
"Staying here was a terrific experience! All of the staff are warm, friends and exceedingly helpful. The room was really superb, and the location is great. The views are spectacular. When we arrived and went to our room our jaws practically dropped because everything about it was much more than we had expected. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.Rich and Carol",0
"We had the best time in Mykonos and Nissaki was part of it. The Hotel is right next to one of best beaches of Mykonos, a 5 min walk to Psarou Beach. Our Room was very comfortable, very clean. The breakfast was one of the best we had. Full of everything you may think. We had dinner one night and was good. Spend time by the pool, drinking a cold white wine is a must. The SPA is great too. We did a a jacuzzi with steam bath. It surely relaxed after a day exploring the Island. The Hotel staff is very friendly. They booked us a scooter, restaurant reservations and other. If I'd go back to Mykonos, this is the place to stay.",0
"Stayed here for the second time, amazing service from all the staff could not fault the venue, location and staff as they made us feel like part of the family! Thanks to all the staff, Evangelia, Spiro, Thodori, Elena, Giorgo, Francesca, Stefano, Apostoli for making our stay memorable and looking forward visiting you again next year!

"We stayed at Nissaki Boutique hotel for two nights . Although check-in was delayed a little but the hospitality , friendliness of the staff , well laid breakfast , uninterrupted views of the Aegean from the balcony of our room , made our stay memorable . The hotel is situated in close proximity to the beaches and restaurants . I would recommend a stay here at Nissaki .   Room Tip: choose sea-facing rooms See more room tips",1
"Where to begin. I am an avid traveler based NYC. I have high standards but am a realist at heart. My partner and I did our research before our greek island hopping adventure. We narrowed our choices down and based on other reviews we made the decision to book a suite at Nissaki. We booked early and paid in advance which offered us an amazing advantage. We actually found the hotels website had better offers than third party providers for this particular hotel.The pros:- STAFF WOW! WOW! WOW! Words will not describe those subtle moments that the Nissaki staff created to make you feel like they were simply an extension of your own family hosting you in their own home. Hands down best service in all of our world travels no questions asked-THE HOTEL: the hotel is has an ideal location nestled between Psarrou beach and Platis Gialos. The bus stop into town is a 3 minute walk from the hotel. The decor is classic Mykonos, clean, sleek, white and boasts the most stunning view of the Aegean Sea, Psarrou beach and the line up of multimillion dollar yachts. There are three distinct poolAreas, a bar that seems to be open even when we crawled in at 3 am. The breakfast area and Restaraunt are placed to structurally enhance the best view of the resort. Our room was a suite with a beautiful balcony (515 ) I highly recommend it. Rooms are clean well designed and all have views so don't worry.A note on the pool: At times it was so amazing to stay poolside we almost didn't want to go to any of the beaches. -THE FOOD: we only dined at the hotel for breakfast and the spread was heaven. Eggs, breads, cheeses, pastries, yogurt and so much more. Even after 5 days I looked forward to it every morning. -THE BAR: fully functional and stocked with the most amazing bar staff. Special thanks to stefano who is just amazing. -THE GUESTS: from all walks of life European, American, Australian, the most friendly of travelers will surround you. There were families too with young children who seems to be having the best of turns The cons: trust me I love to find the fault in all things in life. The only con I have is a simple positive negative and that is that leaving was truly hard. We usually don't come back to the same place twice but I could already tell that Nissaki may become a regular destination for us. In summary this place is great. It was the best choice we made and we will most likely go again. It even inspired us to think about a way to have our wedding there. Eric and Paolo",0
"We just came back from spending a week at the Nissaki, and I can't say enough good things about the experience. The hotel as absolutely immaculate, and beautifully designed. Our room was lovely and spotless with a nice Jacuzzi tub and sliding glass doors opening out to the pool deck. The staff is wonderful and considerate and very helpful making us feel right at home. The breakfast was tops with so many items to choose from... everything from smoked salmon to every variety of Greek speciality available. For those who like to stay connected, the Wifi worked well and CNN was available... although Mykonos is so amazing, who wants to watch CNN? Platas Gialos was also a nice town with lots of entertainment and good food. Beach as great as well with beautiful clear water and sun beds available for 15 Euros.   Room Tip: Being on the pool deck level was nice. See more room tips",0
"Had an amazing stay at Nissaki! No complains whatsoever! Food is amazing, everywhere is spotless, service is instant. All the staff were so helpful with any request, and in general just very friendly, especially one member called Spyros, who was outstanding! One of the best experiences I've ever had at an hotel , definitely would stay there again without a doubt! It was everything a 5* hotel should be and more!",0
"First of all the hotel is located in the terrific area. You just walk right down the street and there is a group of restaurants, little tiny markets, and twi beaches. In Mykonos, I prefer not to be right on the beach because it's a party scene and it's extremely busy. If you don't know the scene in Mykonos you couldn't not imagine how crazy it could get. First thing I noticed was the service at our hotel. The staff that was so attentive and we were upgraded to a VIP room. The room was perfect. We spend every day balcony in the Jacuzzi. The breakfast was spectacular. They had so many different kinds of toppings, dried fruit, jars of jelly's, locks, rolls, candy, I couldn't believe it. Fresh orange juice was fabulous. For some reason the fruit and vegetables in Mykonos tasted so much better than what we get in the United States. I am so glad we picked this hotel. I would be disappointed coming back here if I didn't stay in this room and at this hotel again. We will be going to Santorini and I hope I won't be disappointed. I can't imagine another hotel being this wonderful.",0
"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for the duration of our wedding in Mykonos.The staff had lots to organise from our guests to the concierge services of getting my dress steamed.taxis , transpiration of fifty guests to our venue.The staff are what make this venue, with nothing too much trouble . They all deserve a thank you individually.The stunning views are never tiresome, and great to people or boat watch.The food from breakfast lunch or dinner, are served with the five star service and cater for every single palette.This is our second visit and the improvements are stunning.We will return, as this is a special place and always will be.",1
We had a wonderful stay at this boutique hotel. The hotel staff was so helpful and friendly! They helped plan excursions and suggested wonderful places to dine! Our patio view was overlooking the Psarou Beach & Nammos restaurant. Nissaki is in walking distance to the boat taxi to explore the 8 other beaches. The town is close by as well. The accomodations were so spacious.The bar and pools are awesome and the breakfast buffet is fantastic. We loved our stay at Nissaki andwould definitely stay they again! R&M,0
"It was a wonderful hotel with five star benefits!Luxury, style,comfort,cleanliness, variety of quality services.The staff was kind and helpfull especially Theo.He was everywhere for everyone!I absolutely reccomend it!!!!",1
"Words cannot describe how amazing this hotel is! The moment you get to the mykonos airport you have a shuttle ready to take to you to the hotel and it's less than ten minutes away. Upon arriving you will be greeted by the amazing bell boy Spyros! You can tell he has fun with his job and he is always trying to help guests to enjoy their stay. This guy works hard and he deserves a raise! He is hilarious and always has a smile whenever you see him! The rooms are really nice, nice layouts and very modern while still being close the the Grecian charm you look for when booking a hotel. The cleaning staff replenish towels and toiletries not only during the day but at night too and give you a special turn down service before bed, usually when you're out to dinner. The food here is incredible. It was hard to venture off the hotel for food because it was so good and service was so great but we did anyways to get a variety.Thomai the hotel manager/concierge (I believe) was so helpful. Always giving suggestions for where to go for dinner and how to get to places you wanted to explore. The bar service was great. Always had someone circling the pool area very often to see if you needed a drink or a snack and Stepanos (sp?) was incredible all around. Great to chat with, made amazing cocktails tailored to our likes and just a fun guy to be around. I would love to come back here in a heartbeat! The hotel and staff made our honeymoon and Id love to return for an anniversary!",0
"An honour to be here, the best hotel experience ever , everything but the internet was fantastic , just one to put out that if u go there (Sypros the man) will do anything to make ur day, literary carrying 22 bags going and coming non stop and always being kind , always receiving tips ,he is one of a kind.",0
Fabulous property ! Great location Easily accessible to Mykonos town and all beaches Super helpful Hotel staff Hotel is like home Exceptional service Special mention to : Francesca Evangelina Spyros for always being there Cheers !!!!,0
"Everything was lovely. We were there for a friend's wedding, and many of our party stayed at Nissaki. The hotel did everything they could to make everything perfect. The hotel itself is lovely, and the pools are amazing. The service is also amazing. I would go there again and again. Oh, be sure to get to know Eva. She will personally work to ensure that your vacation is everything you would want it to be!   Room Tip: The standard rooms have the shower next to the bed bed; if traveling with someone other than a roman... See more room tips",0
"First of all I wanted to say the service is amazing , the view and the service is unbelievable , the food blows my mind away , There is one guy called spyros ; he is the best everything he does everything for us and always receives tips , helps with everything , kind , and talkative. He is just the perfect worker . <U+2764><U+FE0F>",0
"We fell in love with this boutique hotel! It is indeed a 5 star paradise, once you get here you are surrounded by luxury and breathtaking views!First of all, the staff is just amazing and the service was impeccable - from A to Z, we would like to thank everyone for their hard work! It felt like home away from home :)Loved the design: simple, mykonian colors, everything is very tasteful. Can't beat the location - steps away from both Platys Gialos and Psarou beach, very close to the bus stop.And the restaurant serves delicious food! Breakfast starts at 8AM and is copious - tailored to every possible taste. Lunch and dinner were wonderful, too. *Portions are generous, great for sharing. The view from the restaurant is unbeatable - overlooking Psarou beach and the beautiful sea. It is open until midnight.The bar is open until 2 am every night, just in case you need something :) We spent many breezy nights at the bar, chatting with our favorite bartender, George. He makes the best Greek coffee and has the best tips on Mykonos and Greece :) The spa staff is highly skilled; all services were provided at the highest level. Loved the steam room, too. You should try the special black pearl facial!The rooms are well furnished, the bedding and pillows are very comfortable; we slept like babies!We'll only stay here when we come back. It was our best vacation, and we took home unforgettable memories.",0
"This is a super little hotel perfectly located. Could not fault it. The view is incredible and the service is very personal. Will definitely come back when I return to Mykonos.Also, only 10 minutes to the town center, what more can you ask for?",0
Visited Mykonos for the first time in May. Spent a week at this fabulous hotel. Everything was just fantastic. It was like paradise. The staff were all very good and helpful and the service was first class. Eva was really good and nothing was too much trouble for her. Cannot wait to go back and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a really first class holiday,0
"Excellent hotel! Very kind and efficient staff. Very good location, with a beautiful view of Psarou Beach. The restaurant is excellent, with very good dishes you can taste while enjoying the view. Breakfast very good as well, with a lot of delicious options.   Room Tip: There are rooms facing the swimming pool you may want to avoid. See more room tips",0
From the moment we arrived to the hotel till the moment that we left everything was excellent! The hotel has a very nice location and everything is very close to you. The stuff is brilliant and very nice people! The restaurant the food the breakfast all was amazing! Special mention to Spyros the very nice and helpful blonde guy that welcome us at the moment we arrived and gave us a lot of tips on the island that makes this vacation even more good that we imagine.,0
"The hotel itself is superb with attention to detail having the guests' comfort and pleasure number 1 priority. Rooms:Amazing! Staff:Ideal. Food and drink:ExcellentHighly recommended!!!!! Having been visiting Mykonos every summer for the past 15 years always staying at 5star accommodation, we can easily call Nissaki Hotel ""The ultimate place to stay in Mykonos""",0
Fabulous small boutique hotel in the centre of Platy Yalous. Wonderful situation overlooking Psarou Beach Great choice for breakfast and good restaurant with superb views over the sea. Very friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Bedrooms are very comfortable and well appointed. Not too large and therefore very personal service. Would definitely recommend as a little haven with peace and quiet in a busy area. Short 15 minute ride into Mykonos Town and close to the beaches of Paraga and Paradise. Will definitely be back again soon. Roger B.,0
"Words couldn't explain this place, except the fact mykonos itself is so amazing, this hotel just takes you to a whole now level. Its starts the second you enter the hotel, an amazing crew welcome you with smiles and love, they give you a welcome drinks and ask you how are you, then with patience and kind show you the hotel; amazing pools (4), breathtaking view, stylish dining room and spa, the nice lady in the reception was so lovely and even upgrade us to the suit(!!) , the room is so clean the view from the room was just spectacular . About the stuff our love story with Stefanos- the professional bar tender started at our first 10 min at the hotel, he welcomed us with a great cocktails and a lot of information about Mykonos. Seyros the cutest guy helps us so much!- recommended us about places to visit, restaurant and bars and always welcomed us with a big smile! Couldn't ask for more! We'll definitely come back next summer.",0
"From the minute we arrived we were blown away with the location. The setting is just perfect. Style and decor just amazing. The staff cannot do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble. They showed us all suitable accommodation that would suit party of 2 couples. Ended up with a truly magical suite overlooking one of the 4 pools with views out across Psaros beach. Nissaki surpassed our expectations even after spending many hours of reviewing hotels before booking this. Do yourself a favour book this hotel....... you will not be disappointed. As for the breakfast and dinners......OMG. Selection galore! The chef cooks up a gastronomic delight. We move onto Paros after 5 nights here and the bar has been set so high. This is a dream hotel. Location location location. We love Nissaki. Thank you staff also for the impeccable customer service. Everything 10 out of 10.",0
"Staying at the Nissaki Hotel was an AMAZING experience. We stayed for a week and everything was stellar, from the superbly attentive staff to the luxurious views and rooms. Special shout outs to Spyros, Stefanos and Apostolis for service above and beyond the call of duty. My wife and I loved the food, service and amenities and my 4 year old daughter LOVED the salt water kiddie pool. This place is great for families or couple as the pools are adequately separated by a property to allow all types of vacationing. Will return for sure.",0
"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in this amazing place of Mykonos... We love the view and the stuff... An amazing location between two beaches and just ten minutes away from town by bus!! I wanna say a special thanks to Spyros the bell boy for his help on us... An amazing young guy that everyone loves!! Definitely come back,room 512!!",0
"Great and amazing location! The stuff make me and my friend feel at home! Perfect tretments by spa and the resturant but...I have to make a special mention to the manager! Pay attention! Spyros the bell boy is the man! The person that everyboddy haves to meet! Amazing just 1 word! I will definitely come back to meet that guy! Well done to the owners for the amazing stuff! Spyros my friend,see u in a month!",1
"The most amazing treatment I've ever had at a hotel. By the time we left we knew every single staff members' name. They all went out of their way to make every part of our stay exquisite. Our 4.5 year old had the time of her life and fell in love with everyone at the hotel. We will be back for sure very soon. Thank you to Apostalis, Theo, George, Spyros, Elena, Ilios, Stefanos, Simeon, Evangelia and all the rest of the staff who's names I can't recall at this moment! Beautiful people!",1
The hotel is just looking the same as the the picture on the website and more beautiful. The sea food in the resteraunt is must try ! We are so pleased with our stay and want to take the whole family here next time. The hotel staff is super nice especially spyros helping out with bags. We are delighted to be served as a guest here and they will try to meet all your needs.,0

"The warming and friendly environment that the staff (Spyros, George, Francesca, Apostolis, Evangelia...to name a few) creates while you're here made our stay incredible! We were here for a wedding and couldn't have had a better time! They made us want to make this an annual vacation with friends. I don't want to go home!",1

"The service is just so good. The reception ladies, the guy in the restaurant and I should say everyone in the hotel, delivers extraordinary service.The bellboy named SPYROS in particular, exceptional. A Greek young lad, did his job well in a decent manner, with his signature smile, being friendly and outspoken when it comes to interpersonal skills. (I once witnessed him playing toys with a 3years old kid, that scene is just beyond words)Wish him the best and I'm sure he will succeed in every aspects.",0
What a wonderful hotel! Extremely friendly staff who are always helpful with your needs. They helped set up a tour of the island during our stay!

"I highly recommend the Nisakki when you travel to Mykonos. The property is beautiful from the rooms,to the pool, restaurants and view. Each room has its own little balcony, with a gorgeous ocean view. Service is excellent,especially Francesca and the concierge (particularly when we had to unexpectedly leave early due to a ferry strike-not sure what we would have done without them! ), to Spiros the very friendly bellboy and Phevos and the bar. The buffet breakfast was wonderful and transportation to and from the ferry was included. There is a small gym which was nice to kill some time when it rained and we had lovely massages in the spa. Location is excellent as you can walk to a couple of beaches from here,or take a short taxi or bus ride to Chora town",0
"High class hotel !!! Polite staff, very clean, comfortable room,the price in relation to the room and the service is fair to any customer, great view, walking distance to the most famous beach of the island. And the SPA ....... Just Try it !!!!! I love this place and I will definitely visit again!",1
"This is our first visit to Mykonos and our travel agency helped to book this accommodation.The location is perfect. The entire hotel overlooks the Psarou beach and bay, providing stunning sea view. Located between two beaches, you can find many beach front restaurants, two mini marts and a bus stop (takes you into town), all within short walking distances.The staff were all excellent, providing professional and first class service. I need to specially thank Spyros for his cheerful and funny personality, Evangela for her attention to detail and always treating us like VIPs and others like Francesca, Elana, Theo for attending to our questions and requests.The room was fantastic. We were given a room on the upper floor which was overlooking the pool and had more privacy than the rooms right next to the pool. It also came with a hot tub (Not sure if every room has one).The breakfast is buffet spread that has so many varieties that you will be spoiled for choice. It is served at the restaurant and has the same amazing view as the pools.Hotel also has a spa and gym. Great for those who needs to sneak in a holiday workout.We love this place and will definitely visit again! Thank you.",1
"We are about to depart from our week long stay at Nisakki Boutique Hotel and felt we couldn't wait to pass on our recommendation. Everything about this hotel from the minute you step off the complementary shuttle service is outstanding. First and foremost the staff are excellent and so very welcoming, which you don't find everywhere. The hotel itself is stunning, with views that take your breath away. We stayed in a junior suite which is beautifully clean (as is the rest of the hotel) and the bed is extremely comfortable. The breakfast is amazing, with so much to choose from, there's certainly something for everyone. When your only issue with a holiday is that you wish you could have stayed longer, you know you're on to a winner! We will most definitely be back!",1
"A high class hotel!! The service was excelent, the rooms are big and the pool was relaxing. There is a transfer to and from the hotel to everywhere! There are lots of good reataurants few steps from the hotel. Best breakfast ever. Sure we will come bac",1

"This must be the best hotel I've stayed at... From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't be any more helpful, we also got upgraded on arrival, the room 513 was amazing! The breakfast selection was second to none and the view from the restaurant was picture perfect. The sun loungers were the most comfortable I've used... Apart from the hotel our other perfect find was Nikolas beach bar and restaurant a 15 minute walk along the beach. Would I return? In an instant.",0
Beautiful hotel with brilliant staff and service. Stefanos behind the bar makes the best custom cocktails and the cheeky charming Spyros is always around to help with anything you need! Relax by the pool and listen to the music wafting up from Nammos beach club. Enjoy complimentary hand massages and shots by the pool. Protected from the wind. We enjoyed a relaxing couples massage at the spa. The Greek salad off the lunch menu is great. Can't wait to visit again.,1
"I really loved this hotel, it was really beautiful and the service was great. Spyros was so amazing he was so helpfull with everything. Me and my cousins loved him. We would recomend this place to anyone. The pool side was beautiful and the wiew was beautiful. You could see a really nice beach from the pool side. The hotel is near to two beautiful beaches. Everything was so perfect!",1
A beautiful hotel with fantastic staff. The rooms were very clean and cleaned daily. Breakfeast was included with a variety of options and was yummy. The views are spectacular and breath taking only a short distant walk to the city center. Anna and Yannis are very friendly and accomodating and assist with everything. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone and will defiantly be coming back.,0
This is one of the friendliest hotels which I've stayed in. Anna and Yannis (the owners) do an amazing job of making their guests feel welcome and are clearly very passionate about ensuring that you get the most out of your holiday in Mykonos. The hotel is located a short walk from the main town and has a lovely pool and bar area which has beautiful views across the sea. The rooms are comfortable and cleaned to a good standard with complimentary toiletries. The breakfast buffet has everything you need to set you up for a day of sightseeing or relaxing by the pool. Will definitely be back.,0
"I have just come back from a week in Mykonos and I would recommend Hotel Tagoo. This hotel has spectacular views, lovely staff and very pleasant rooms. It is a short walk into town with easy access to restaurants and night life. Hotel Tagoo is very much a family run hotel and manages to strike that lovely balance between privacy and feeling part of the family. By the end of the week it felt like I knew everyone. The hotel helped us with booking restaurants, hire cars and a boat cruise. I will be going back.",0
"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. Beautiful hotel, awesome pool, nice rooms (simple, clean and comfortable) and in a great position just a short walk from Mykonos Town. Very comfortable and easy stay. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Breakfast was simple and yummy - a great start to the day. We had a relaxing and wonderful time. Can't fault it. Would stay again.",0
"I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel! The family that runs it made me feel so welcome and we're extremely kind to me. The room was fantastic, very comfy bed and a beautiful bathroom. And the view from this place is breathtaking! And if you don't feel like heading to the beach, the pool/bar area are fantastic as well! The main town is only a short walk away! I highly recommend staying here and I can't wait to return one day!",2
I absolutely love this hotel from the moment you arrive there is a friendliness that makes you feel like you are part of the family a genuine care. After being greeted with great generosity the first thing you see is the beautiful sea and pool with poolside bar and restaurant it's incredible.. The rooms are in the traditional white Mykonos style very relaxing and it's only a short walk from town. This hotel is an absolute gem. I will be back next year. ENJOY!!   Room Tip: Ask for the sea view upstairs you get an amazing view in the morning for breakfast ;-) See more room tips,1
"I went away with 5 girlfriends in June and had the most wonderful time at this hotel. Anna and the staff were faultless and always ready to help with any advice or reservations we might want to book, ordering us cars etc to get us around the island. I had a room with a new bathroom which was ideal. For the price i wasn't expecting 5* luxury but it was clean, basic and the beds were comfortable. Clean towels, sheets and new toiletries daily. i would 100% recommend staying here. The views & location is second to none - everyone outside the hotel we spoke to said the sunset at Cavo tagoo (a nearby luxury hotel) were the best on the island but this Hotel tagoo is situated above there and a much better location to watch the location. I also got to see the rooms and poolside of a couple of other more expensive hotels and i would chose Tagoo hotel over these even if the price was the same. The food by the pool was great, breakfast was the only slight let down for me but again they did have a variety of choice. I would just ditch the sweet squash if i was them. The hotel is less then 10mins walk from town and i can't wait to return again very very soon. Thank you Hotel Tagoo for making our holiday so fantastic. We had such a wonderful time staying with you.",1
Fantastic superb and perfect. Everything about my stay at Hotel Tagoo was top notch. The staff was fantastic. The location was right where you would want to be and the pool/bar and rooms were everything I wanted them to be. I will definitely be back.,0
"We have recently finished a wonderful ten night stay at the Tagoo. It's been five years since my last review of the Tagoo, but I thought another one was necessary given some great changes at the hotel. Most notably, the new bathrooms and floors in most of the rooms - which make them look a million dollars.The floors add a sophisticated look and it really is amazing to think this is only a two star hotel. The power showers are fantastic with plenty of water pressure and plenty of hot water. There are new shower enclosures, new toilets and vanity units (with plenty of space to spread out all your lotions), beautiful stone basins and a handcrafted mirror frame which is just amazing. All topped off by smart new lighting which brings out your tan :-)We keep coming back to the Tagoo each year (it's now been 10 visits in the last 11 yeaers!). Why? That view!! The relaxed atmosphere around the pool. Seeing the other regulars (and meeting new ones) and sharing stories around the pool and bar. And of course catching up on the news from Anna and her family and the other staff who are there season after season. We've seen Ted take on the bar during the day (he's got some great stories to tell!) and add some new drinks and delicious menu items, while Jimmy keeps rocking the bar in the evenings and plays cool tunes. Yiannis is ever dependable in getting you from port/airport to hotel and back again, Rouli does a great job in orientating new guests to the delights and mysteries of Mykonos, the housekeeping team do a fine job keeping the rooms and property in shape, and Nikos does all the heavy lifting so we don't have to (and keeps the garden looking great too!). And of course Anna looks after us all during the morning shift to make sure our days will run smoothly, that we've had enough free breakfast and she will always have a suggestion to improve your stay.We have noticed subtle improvements over the past couple of few years too. More breakfast choice, new toilets and change rooms at the pool area, free wifi across the hotel, complimentary bottled water on your first day, better quality toiletries, the sun deck area with comfortable loungers, some cosmetic changes to the bar area and so on.The hotel retains it charm and offers comfortable accommodation at what I think is very good value on a island that can easily burn through your euros. The stroll into town gets easier after the second day (more room for more saganaki!) and we also appreciate that car parking is available at the Tagoo (a few minutes up the hill) - this really sets it apart from many budget hotels and most hotels in town. I also took advantage for the first time of the 'library' with books available in many languages to read while you relax and gaze at the amazing views! As for Mykonos this year, there are lots of new restaurants and bars - with many aiming for the big spenders, but there is value to be had - and Rouli and Anna can help direct you to places within your budget - whatever it may be. Don't be put off by perceptions that Mykonos isn't for everyone - whether financial or otherwise. While many hotels are happy to charge exorbitant rates, the Tagoo offers excellent value, with solid amenities and the most charming atmosphere. See you next year!!",2
"We came back to tagoo hotel , 9 years after our first stay there in 2007... The hotel is still the best value for money hotel in MykonosThe hotel is 10 minutes walking from city center, which is very convenient (finding a parking in Mykonos is a big challenge ...)Rooms have been renovated recently and offer a stunning view on mykonos town bayAnna is as always very helpful , she will do her best to answer any of your request.   Room Tip: Room 20 offers the best view See more room tips",0
"All of the reviews on Trip Advisor are true! Its the staff of this place that made us feel like family. There wasn't a day that went by where we wee not greeted with a massive smile and a chat. Jimmy's strawberry cocktails are to die for! My only regret with this place is we didn't stay longer fully in to the summer so I can see the place light up with greek nights, and to enjoy this place some more! The location was great for us- only a short walk in to Mykonos town. We hired a car to get round the island, which I recommended at least for a couple of days to get to places the buses don't go. The rooms have everything you need, bed, renovated bathrooms, air con and good views from everywhere really! Only one issue I had was the first room we stayed in- could only get good wifi sitting just outside- so a room closer near the common area would be better for wifi- but seriously- you will barely be in your room I gurantee! Listen to all the tips of where to eat and what beaches to go to- you wont be disappointed!If you want a 5 star hotel with luxury amenities but no soul and pay a fortune- go somewhere else. If you want 3 star hotel- with all you need and people who will make your trip unforgettable- then honestly- stay here. We cannot wait to go back and visit Anna and the family back in Mykonos. Thank you so much guys- we miss you!!!!!",0
"It's missing the point a little to talk about ""value"" when the view from this hotel is absolutely priceless. But you know when you're staying at Tagoo that you're getting what you paid for, and so much more. The price is so reasonable because the hotel does not ask you to waste money on frippery. The rooms, are simple, almost rustic, and essentially Greek. For this guest, they were perfect. Then you step outside and you are part of a vista that incorporates the town, the port, the hills, sea and sky on the horizon with its majestic, unforgettable sunsets. It is breathtaking. Then there's the bar and the pool. Fruity cocktails and homemade Greek food. Wonderful people from all parts of the world with whom you cannot help but befriend so that the magic of Mykonos stays a part of your life forever. And then there's Anna, and the Tagoo staff. Cannot say enough about their welcoming warmth, and their readiness to guide, point, help and generally induct you into their Tagoo family. We visited 5 star hotels whilst there that were clinical, officious and very vanilla. Everything Tagoo is not. We met many seasoned travelers - guests who return every year - who likewise espoused the value of Tagoo. An unforgettable stay, with a very personal vibe.   Room Tip: The higher you go, the better the view; and yet the rooms below have their own charm. The public ar... See more room tips",1
"Before we even arrived, Anna was very communicative about our reservation...even with all our changes. We ended up missing our connection to Mykonos and arriving late, but it was not problem...they even picked us up from the airport. Once we arrived, we felt absolutely welcome by all the staff. Not only was Anna and the staff wonderful, but all the guests were great as well. Come to find out, most of the people we met have been repeat visitors, and now I see why. You become part of the Hotel Tagoo family. They were very helpful with excursions and information. The place is situated on a hillside just a 10 minute walk from the town center, which is perfect for a little bit of quiet, and offers great views of the sea. If you didn't feel like getting out for the day, it was wonderful to just hang out by the pool and order drinks & food. Our room was very comfortable, and the updated bathrooms were very nice. Not to mention, it is also a great value. It's a place I would highly recommend, and would stay there again!   Room Tip: Get one of the rooms with updated bathrooms...and higher up the hillside. See more room tips",1
"A good basic hotel or more of a guest house, Located on top of a hill with a rather dangerous walk to the town especially at night. Reason that it is dangerous is that it is too narrow for both walker and car to pass without the walker having to stop and stand aside for the car to pass, poorly lit at night. It takes a good 15 minutes to walk into town.   Room Tip: a lot of steps involved so not suitable for disabled, old or young families with pram. no room has... See more room tips",0
"The only problem with this hotel is the fact that you are gonna have to be so sad on the day you leave! From the minute you walk in and see the view from the pool, you can feel yourself relax and unwind instantly. Everyone who looks after you constantly has become a friend and I thoroughly enjoy our chats and the valuable information that they have offered to make the island experience more special.The new bathrooms are done to a really high standard and it's so unusual to see a spa type shower in any hotel, let alone a small 2 star hotel on a Greek island.Anna hosted her Greek night and it gives all of he guests the chance to meet each other and enjoy some of her delicious homemade pies! It's a hotel that's full of regulars who we have met each year and it's down to the fact that Hotel Tagoo is all you could ask for if you want a clean, relaxing and charming hotel with the best sunset views on the island.",1
"Picked this spot based on TA reviews and could not have been happier. Great room with view, great pool, really great pool. Walking distance to old Town. Simple but very good breakfast, eggs, bacon, pastries, jams, bread, cereals, good coffee. Anna, Jim and Niko are exceptional hosts and go out of there way to make sure your experience is first class. This is a 2 star hotel that rivals many 3 and some 4 star hotels I have stayed in. My ultimate test of giving 5 stars is when I can honestly say I will be back. I will be back here. Wi-fi best we had in 6 weeks across Europe.   Room Tip: All rooms great See more room tips",1
"We spent 3 beautiful days in tagoo. Warm and welcoming atmosphere ! The atmosphere and orher guests make you feel comfortable as if you were at home, what a surprise ! Here you can feel at home, enjoying the nice view of the swimming pool and meeting new lovely people, most of them coming back since they fall in love with this great place ! Great experience we already looking forward coming back!",1
This is our 7th time staying at Hotel Tagoo .. & it feels like home away from home ..Anna & Yannis & everyone here are just the most amazing people .. Kind & will organize & advise you on what to visit & see on Mykonos island ... & beyond ..The hotel rooms & bathrooms have just been renovated .. Even have Spa jet showers !! This hotel is a little sanctuary to escape the hustle of Mykonos town .. The bar is the place to be at sunset overlooking the pool & the sea beyond.We have made many wonderful memories here & I highly recommend staying at this wonderful hotel Yamas,0
"I can not say enough good things about this hotel. Upon arriving at Hotel Tagoo, the entire staff and returning guests made us feel like we were a part of a very special family in Mykonos. The staff at Hotel Tagoo went over and beyond to make our stay extremely special. The rooms are comfortable, the views are stunning, the location is convenient and the staff is amazing. I am so glad this was the hotel we chose to stay at on our trip to Mykonos and truly believe our trip would not have been nearly as amazing if we had not stayed at Hotel Tagoo. We will definitely be returning. We left this hotel with a great group of new friends and were sad to leave them and this incredibly special hotel! You are truly missing out if you chose a different hotel.",0
"Stayed here for five days with a large group of friends and couldn't fault it- the staff, accommodation and poolside amenities are superb. Anna and her family go above and beyond it to make your holiday a truly wonderful experience with lots of finishing touches that are often overlooked. The free use of air conditioning, sun bed towels and hairdryers are welcomed and the hospitality is great including airport transfers and a very flexible and wide ranging menu.The stunning sea views and short walk to the town make this a magical place to stay and I would highly recommend it to anyone.Can't wait to return!X",0
"Small, intimate and homely. Anna and her staff make you extremely welcome.Had a lovely week exploring Myknosos. ..Anna always very eager to inform you where to visit...this was very welcomed by us.Great location and 10 minutes walk into town. Really great restaurants and very safe",0
"We have just returned from an incredible week on the island of Mykonos. Never been before but will certainly return.We stayed at Hotel Tagoo with a large group of friends to celebrate a birthday. The birthday boy and his fiance had been to Mykonos and Hotel Tagoo before and had always spoken so fondly of it.Rooms are clean and spacious, our triple room had a brand new bathroom and great air conditioning. There was a safe, tv and fridge in the room too.The small table and chairs outside the front door were perfect to enjoy the incredible view across the sea with a sundowner.From the swimming pool too you can see out to sea, watch the cruise ships coming and going and the sun set takes your breath away every single night.The staff - Anna, Yannis, Jimmy, Theo & Nicos (and the lovely ladies at breakfast and who cleaned our rooms) couldn't do enough to help. We were collected from the airport, welcomed on arrival, bags swept up to our rooms immediately. During our stay we were shown sidaki dancing, how to cook traditional Greek dishes and given so much help arranging excursions, meals and transport. When my iPhone broke, I was driven to the repair shop - no questions asked! Such amazing service.I couldn't fault it - great location, great price, great team of staff.We will definitely be back! Thank you all so much xxx",0
"This was my fourth stay. With 26 guests we pretty much took over the hotel and what a fabulous time we had! Anna sorted reservations and transport for us. Jimmy and Theo went well beyond the call of duty, keeping the bar open to the early hours. The room were kept spotlessly clean and we all enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.Many of the rooms have been overhauled with superb new bathrooms, so the accommodation is well in excess of what you would reasonably expect for 2 stars!Whilst we were there it was my fiance's birthday and Anna organised a delicious cake and personally cooked a number of Greek delicacies for all of us. We could not have enjoyed our stay more and it really is exceptional value for money. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",1
"My Friends and I visited a Beautiful Town of Mykonos, Greece last May 2016. Hotel Tagoo was recommended by a fellow colleague and made reservations 4 months prior to our scheduled Mykonos Vacation. When we arrived in Mykonos we were picked up promptly by the Hotel Transportation. Upon arriving at Hotel Tagoo... We discovered what a wonderful Gem of a Hotel it was. The View was SPECTACULAR on every rooms. The Room are spacious and very sparkling clean. We met the Host of Hotel Tagoo, Anna. She was a gracious and lovely host. She provided everything that we needed from Restaurant Tips, Beaches Recommendations, Highlights to see in Mykonos. There is a list of wonderful restaurants and we did went to half of those list and it was well worth it.. We had the Best Of Mykonos it has to offer. The Pool and the Bar is Fabulous.. The View are Breathtaking. The Complimentary Hot Breakfast are your typical Western fare of Eggs, Sausage or Bacon (Depending on the day) and some Local Greek Fare such as Salads and Cheese. Hotel Tagoo is one Magical and Fabulous place to stay. From every room and every view and great Customer Service..You will definitely have a memorable experience. One that you will always come back for. I know we did and we're looking forward to our next Mykonos trip in Hotel Tagoo for many, many years to come. WilliamPhoenix, AZ",1
"The first thing my stay here taught me is what nonsense star ratings can be. This place is fantastic and I would recommend it time and again to anyone. If you're looking for a clean, welcoming, comfortable, friendly and relaxing place to stay this is it. Look no further. I stayed in May/June in a double room at a rate of €100pn. I think this was incredibly reasonable. The rate includes breakfast every day which is nothing extraordinary but all you need; cereal, toast, eggs, sausage, pastries etc. Some rooms have been refurbished especially the bathrooms so the rate is a little higher for these. Mine wasn't but this really didn't matter. It was still everything you need, clean and well kept. There aren't very many rooms here so this is a more intimate setting and you will come to know the staff well and, more importantly, they will know you. It's very nice to be greeted by name and to have a genuine conversation every day with the hotel staff... When did you last get that? The highlight is the pool/bar area. Although most the rooms and the hotel overlook the sea, this is the place to spend your time whilst at the hotel. The pool is relatively sizeable given the size of the hotel, there are plenty of sun loungers as well as chairs and tables and a shaded terraced area up some steps to the side. The view is beautiful and you will undoubtedly take many pictures of the stunning sunset. Other nice things included airport transfers, a few toiletries and water in the room, a very tasty lunch/snack menu (have the pizza!), beach towels and a charming little parting gift. Ultimately what makes this hotel is the staff. This is a family-run establishment and it shows. They genuinely care about your stay and nothing is too much to ask. They are friendly, inviting and have a lot of really useful local knowledge and contacts that will make your stay that much more enjoyable. Without hesitation I would definitely stay here again.",2
"We had the pleasure of staying with Anna and the folks at the Hotel Tagoo on our recent vacation to Greece. In terms of the famous Greek hospitality, Anna and the team definitely live it. They bent over backward to make sure everyone had everything they needed and make recommendations for places to go, see and eat for our first visit to the island.The hotel is located a little bit out of the pedestrianized area of Mykonos Town (~10 minute walk) and while it is on the ""main road"" there isn't that much traffic and it was high enough up that we didn't hear any noise from the road. We also walked to and from the town with no problem (but I believe they do have a small parking area in the back if you get a car - we didn't - we used the public transport on the island which was fine).The rooms were decently sized and we had a small balcony to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day and enjoy the sunset. We'd definitely stay again on our next visit.",0
"Anna, Her Family and Staff make this trip wonderful every time I come to Mykonos. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The view is just amazing, and the renovations came out fantastic. New updates are also coming this next year as well. The staff here makes you feel welcome, and like family. Always a pleasure! Thank you for everything!",0
This is our second time staying at hotel Tagoo .The staff are all so helpful and friendly.A lot of the rooms have had new bathroom which was done to a very high standard we spent 7 nights here with friends and we were well looked after.Our son and girlfriend are staying in July and I know that they will have a fanatic time.The views from the hotel are amazing too.All ready planning to go again next year .,0
We are just on the boat leaving Mykonos now and are sad to be leaving this fantastic family run wonderful hotel.This was our 2nd visit to hotel Tagoo and it did not disappoint from the moment yianni picked us up from the airport we felt home again. Anna is an amazing host and knows everything there is to know about the island and Greece in general. She will organise absolutely anything for you from car rental to restaurant reservations This is a 2 star hotel with more than 5 star service and feeling. It's like a home away from home we felt relaxed and could do whatever we wanted without feeling restricted.The rooms look exactly as they do on the website photos and were stayed in a Seaview room with one of the updated bathrooms wow they are really nice. The rooms and the hotel as a whole are spotlessly cleaned and meticulously maintained. The bed is probably the comfiest one we've slept in while being away. Rooms have been freshened up with a lot of nice personal touches and are bright and airy.The views are to die for and the pool and bar exactly what you expect when being on an island very comfortable sun chairs thereBreakfast was great with quality products and filled us up until late in the afternoon and got us started for our days of exploring All staff are great and friendly Rouli on afternoon reception jimmy and ted behind the bar vicky the breakfast lady dimitri who helps you with your bags and does maintenance and yianni who picks you up and drops you off from the port or airport.The 2nd time was just as good as the first if not better. We were sad to leave Anna and her amazing hotel but will definitely be back Come as strangers leave as friends is a very accurate description of this hotel. Can't wait to return one day soonNancy and Adam,0
"We returned to the Tagoo for the 5th time with 6 friends and spent 7 nights from 14-21st May.Since our visit last year, 11 rooms have been upgraded with stylish new bathrooms. We were very well looked after as usual by Ruli in reception who booked taxis and restaurants for us, Jimmy and Theo behind the bar and of course, the lovely Anna who is always keen to provide the best Tagoo experience for her guests. If you're looking for a hotel in Mykonos with amazing views and a good location the Tagoo is perfect.",1
"It is always a pleasure to come back to Tagoo. Now this may sound unusual but I do not care if a room has a view or not! I find I spend so little time in my room so it does not matter. And everywhere else in the hotel has a fantastic view. I sit at the bar and it is always better than I remember. So when Anna offered me a discount for a room without a view I was happy to take it. And it was a large room too, very clean, comfortable beds ( OK ... I only tried one!) and quiet.But I did see that they have started renovating the rooms. They are really classy with new bathrooms that are very stylish and luxurious. So for those who need a view these may be the ideal choice. This is a family run hotel but all the staff are helpful, welcoming and always warm and friendly. And that, for me, above all else, is why I keep coming back.   Room Tip: The A/C can also heat the rooms on the colder nights at this time of year. See more room tips",0
"My first visit to Mykonos, and won't be my last, largely due to the wonderful hospitality of Anna and her staff. The rooms are clean a little basic, but the whole ambience is that of a caring, meaningful place to stay. You have the impression you are staying with friends, that what is around you is really your own place. The hotel is only 10 minutes walk from downtown Mykonos, just a stroll really, and you can't get lost. Anna's husband, will collect you at the airport, and her brother Jimmy keeps the bar open and the craic going as long as you want. The view is astonishing and the breakfast sumptuous. All wonderful. I look forward to returning!   Room Tip: Let Anna choose! See more room tips",1
Amazing luxury hotel. Great helpful staff. The look and feel of the hotel is also amazing. They think of the smallest things also. Bathtub had a jacuzzi. Room came with a pool but the water was too cold for swimming. Breakfast is great. Lots of choices. Best hotel experience in Europe so far for me.,0
"This place is more than an accommodation; it is a destination. Having written other reviews on trip advisor, I must also write about this place as well since I have stayed here so many times. Definitely best location and best value for money. Clean with excellent service plus the friendliest owners who are more than helpful in every way. Best sea view and sunset view ever. Anna and John who are the owners truly make you feel at home and are caring in making sure to give you on the spot information about best places to visit, eat and have fun. You may even get free Greek cooking lessons as well as Greek dancing lessons, great fun and you will want to go back as I always do!

"Absolutley fantastic ! Absolutely love this place , love the family , love the setting ! For those who have never been , one answer just GO. Tagoo is run by a lovely friendly family who make their visitors part of their family during their stay. Set on a small hill , nothing too energetic , this small but perfectly formed hotel provides all you could need for a great stay in Mykonos. Sunsets are available most evenings without having to contend with any madning crowd just the cool calm chilled atmosphere and gentle tunes echoing from the great bar and its hosts . Rooms are a good size with all mod cons and either balcony or terrace overlooking the sea. Overall a great hotel that gives a real personal touch . Will definitely return as I like so many others have got the Tagoo bug !",1
"We stayed here in two periods during September 2015 - something we do not regret. Yiannis picked us up at the airport and also picked us up after our little island hopping - what a service ! The rooms were very good and what a view! Wonderful pool area, a great place to enjoy the beautiful sunset . Amazing staff - Anna , Yiannis , Jimmy , Nico and others, everyone was so friendly and helpful! We can highly recommend this hotel!",1
"This hotel is a treasure because you come away with much more than you came with. Sure it is super clean, convenient to town, and has fantastic sunsets; reasons enough to stay at a hotel. But what sets it apart from all other hotels is family. Yanis picks you up when you get to Mykonos. Anna gets you checked in. Nikos helps you with your bags. Vicki serves you breakfast. Teddy and Jimmy will serve you drinks. But it is more than a family owned/operated hotel that treats you like family. It is a destination where you check in as a stranger and check out as family. Welcome home!",1
"I have traveled to many places and Hotel Tagoo is unique and very special! Even though I may typically stay at ""fancier"" hotels, I would never stay anywhere else in Mykonos. I have never stayed at another hotel where I feel so relaxed and like I am part of the family. I will definitely be going back....just like many of the guests I met at the hotel who were recurring guests coming back as old friends! The hotel is family run, very warm and welcoming. The hotel is situated in a beautiful spot with a wonderful view - especially for the sunset each evening from the open air bar. Walking distance to Mykonos town. The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. The service is excellent and friendly. I had a wonderful time and recommend this hotel whole-heartedly!",0
"My first time to Greece and I stayed here with some friends one of whom comes here every year. The rooms are not fancy (remember it's not a 5 star!) but mine had a great view, comfy bed and was quite clean. Honestly, I didn't spend that much time in the room, this is Mykonos after all! What makes the hotel special is the warmth of the owners, Anna runs the front desk and her husband picks you up and drops you off at the airport for free. They have a great breakfast with good choice of hot and cold items, coffee and juices. The poolside bar is like Cheers where people who come regularly reunite each season and it is quite easy to make new friends. And the pool is beautiful although it was a bit too cold for this Texan in September! Walking distance to town (about 15-20 min) and Anna can help you make reservations at the clubs or restaurants. I would absolutely stay here again.",0
"We only spent 2 days at Hotel Tagoo with our friends in September and wished we had booked longer!We had complimentary transfer and were met by Yiannis at the airport.When we arrived at the hotel, a very handsome young man called Nikos took our cases while we admired the breath taking views from the pool.The rooms were very clean and adequate, better than we had expected and the beds were so comfortable (unusual for Greece) we had a decent nights sleep.Breakfast was excellent; bacon, eggs, sausages, toast, cereals, ham, cheese, fruit, yogurt, tea, coffee, the list goes on......The pool and bar area was really nice and the atmosphere was welcoming. We were provided with towels for the pool area and there were new shower rooms and toilets downstairs, very nice indeed.Anna try's to think of everything, there is even an iron & ironing board in the room. She and her staff made us feel welcome and always gave us useful information about where to go in Mykonos and its neighbouring islands.The location of the hotel is good, just on the edge of town, only 15 minutes to walk to the centre, uphill on the way back (taxi costs 5 euros).I will definitely keep in touch with Anna (she has promised to send me some recipes!) and we will return to Hotel Tagoo, hopefully for a longer stay next time.......",1
"This is our sixth visit to Hotel Tagoo in six years. It is the only hotel we have every gone back to and that is because it is so friendly and welcoming. There is a sign behind the bar that says arrive as strangers and leave as friends and that is how we have felt since the first time we visited.I get so angry when I see negative comments. This hotel is not, and has never pretended to be a five star hotel. It is two star but gives five star service. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Some have private balconies some not but the views are to die for. Each room provides comfortable beds (which had new mattresses two years ago, not thin uncomfortable ones as someone recently described), a fridge, a kettle, and iron and ironing board and a free safe! Frequent visitors to the Greek Islands would know that it is unusual to get all these facilities in a 2* (or even 3* hotel). Of course coffee/tea aren't provided - get real! The water is undrinkable, which again is usual for Greece, Portugal, Spain etc. You needn't walk into town to buy it, you can buy it from the bar!Breakfast is excellent. Hot and cold meats, eggs, cheese, bread, fruit salad, cereal, chocolate cake and much more. The fruit juice again is typical of many of the hotels in Greece, if you want fresh orange you have to buy it.Anna goes out of her way to ensure that people are enjoying themselves, as do the rest of her family and the staff at Hotel Tagoo. Yiannis meets people at the airport and port to transfer them to the hotel. This is free of charge so you don't need to worry about taxis (again above and beyond for a 2* hotel).The walk into town is 15 minutes down and 20 minutes back (up hill). I know because we timed it last time we went. And this is for two 67 year olds!!!As I said we go back yearly, and yes it does get bit hectic around the bar when we meet up with friends we have made there over the past six years. But we have made many new friends also, so those who wish to join in please come along and do so, you are more than welcome.",1
"I stayed at the sister hotel but used this hotel for Breakfast, Pool, and Bar. Theo makes the best bloody mary cocktails in the world (I am a flight attendant--trust me. In the world!) and is always ready in the morning with a Frappe. The breakfast is standard and more than enough to get you ready for another day in paradise. Fresh eggs, cheeses, yogurt, breads, cakes, and more are offered. Enough for everyone to find something. The pool with it's stunning views are magical. Great place to watch the sunsets or the boats come and go. The hotel has plenty of little terraces and quiet areas if you want to be alone or have a romantic moment. No evening would be complete without having Jimmy to talk to and help you unwind.Anna is available in the morning to give you advice on best beaches to go to depending on the weather (it changes daily and depending on the wind she knows the most ideal spots for that day's weather). She can also help with getting beach chairs or a table for lunch and gives tips to plan your day depending on your mood. This island has it all from romance to party. Tell Anna what you want and she will help make it happen.Anna and her family are always professional, warm, welcoming, and are ready to instill their passion for Greece on their guests. I have been going for around 7 years or so. Sometimes twice a year. There are lots of regulars here. It is always a good idea to book early if you have a favorite room or a special request. Many people have made friendships here and come back yearly to visit heaven.The hotel is a close walk to the town and near the bus stations to take you to many beaches if you don't have a car.I read some of the reviews about the bar and the breakfasts. I can't really see what they are complaining about. I was there the morning of a certain towel incident someone wrote up. I never saw Anna act unprofessional in any manner or show anything less than Greek Hospitality. If coming to Mykonos do your homework. This island has it's own allure. It isn't like most other islands. It has a little of everything to offer. This hotel is classed as 2 star. It has 5 star service from the staff. Educated consumers and savvy travelers will find this hotel a true gem.   Room Tip: Room 1 or 2 are my fav. Private balcony with cosy room. See more room tips",3
"We've visited Hotel Tagoo several times in the last few years and it just keeps getting better. This 2* family run hotel is an oasis of calm in bustling Mykonos with amazing views, only a short walk from Mykonos town. The Tagoo team - Anna, Yiannis, Jimmy, Theo, Ruli, Vasso, Lela and Nikos - provide 5* service to ensure that you have an amazing stay. I think this is what makes hotel Tagoo so special and the fact that guests keep returning to Hotel Tagoo is a testament to that. The showers and toilets near the hotel pool and bar have had a luxury make-over this year - absolutely amazing. This trip we stayed in room 17 which has a private patio with a view and a very comfortable bed but we've stayed in other rooms on previous visits and all of them were nice, clean and comfortable. I highly recommend Hotel Tagoo - just make sure you book in time as this gem books up early!",4
"Awesome hotel for the price, breakfast is simple but fine, 10 mins to the bustle, good size rooms and bathroom.Thanks for the free beers Theo!!More than happy to recomend to my kiwi an aussie bros!!Choice",0
"This is a 2 star property and I get the feeling it's a bit of a marmite hotel.The good Pick up and drop offs to airport and port included in priceGreat viewThe best pool side showers and toilets I have seen in Greece ( 5 stars) Lots of hot water and powerful showers In Rooms.Great advice from Anna re beaches and local restaurantsThe bad Breakfast not brilliant ( but lovely waitress ) , bad coffee The OKRooms basic but clean The restThis depends on personal preferences, Anna wants everyone to be a big happy family, this is fine if you go on holiday to meet new friends, and spend lots of time round the bar, however if you like to get away from it all or don't want to join in you could feel a bit of an outsider.This actually put us of using the bar as it felt very cliquy. Water is Undrinkable even if it's boiled in the kettleIt's in a very windy position , not sure it's worth spending money on a private or semi private balcony, ours was unusable but I'm sure this is not always the case.Longish walk into town and dark road with no pavements. It is a 2 star property offers good value, but I think we prefer apartments rather than hotels, obviously a personal preference and many people come back year after year",1
"It must have been a very nice hotel when opened but places need maintenance to keep at their best and Tagoo certainly requires some significant updating. The outdoor spaces are very nice - large swimming pool and sunbathing area with fantastic sea views and a little bar, little terraces outside the room to drink your coffee. The interiors have not stood so well the test of time: tired furniture, uncomfortable beds and bathrooms out of a mental health institution. Our mattress was thin and the springs of the wrought iron frame squeal with every move. The bathrooms have seen no upgrading for 30 years and probably at the time they weren't of the best quality. The towels are sandpaper....Then the service was poor: first thing we were told on our late arrival was that tap water was not potable - thanks for the warning however there was not drinking water on our room and considering the hotel is 700m from town you need to walk at least 1.5km to get some water. There is a kettle and cups but 1) no water (tap water was very salty so no good for coffees) neither 2) coffee or tea bags so what was one meant to use the kettle for?? There were candle holders without candles.....Breakfast can also be improved: fresh juice instead of awful 'sunny delight' juice?The location is good with great views and not too long a walk to reach town - thought it would be nice if they switched the light on on the stairs so one doesn't need to climb them in the dark!",1
"This hotel is basic and in a very windy location but it does have stunning views/sunsets. Breakfast is basic no fresh OJ and awful coffee, hard towels and no drinkable water in rooms. The owner, Anna, is very loud to the point of being annoying. She confronted my friend and I in reception/ open plan breakfast room on our first morning accusing us of 'fouling' on the pillows and towels - this was my hair dye that had run after swimming in the pool. Fawlty Towers has nothing on this place. Spend a bit more money and go somewhere nicer - the rooms do not match the outdoor areas in quality.",0
"It's our second stay here, so they must be doing something right! This is not a five star hotel, but it is in a great location with views of the bay, a decent pool and a friendly bar but best of all its managed by a lovely couple who make your stay special.The bar area at night is quite lively, and the drinks are reasonably priced. The barman knows how to pour a good measure!Breakfasts are reasonable and good quality. Overall for the money it's a great hotel.",0
Room very clean staff very pleasant good view beds comfortable family owned which makes it all the more better if i came back to Mykonos I would stay again here this hotel was recommend d by our friends who stayed here before   Room Tip: Quiet room See more room tips,0
"I've stayed at Hotel Tagoo several times in the past, and I will surely be back as soon as possible. The hotel itself is ideally situated just minutes outside the main town, overlooking the sea. (Amazing sunset view) The accomodations are first-rate: A/C, flat-panel TV, super-comfy bed, balcony, refrigerator, etc... but it's the staff that makes new guests and returning ones alike, feel right at home. Family owned and operated, they obviously care a great deal about their guests' experience there... and once again, this hotel did not disappoint. Yamas!",1
My wife and I have been visiting Mykonos for many years and we usually stay at Hotel Tagoo when we can get a room. We enjoy it more every time we stay. This summer we came to find many physical improvements to the hotel that only made our stay better. The family that runs it is incredible and always friendly. They have their finger on the pulse of Mykonos and can give great recommendations on restaurants and beaches. I have stayed at other more expensive hotels in Mykonos but we always come back to Hotel Tagoo for the friends and quality.,1
"I was very happy with my choice of hotel for a week vacation in Mykonos. Actually my sixth visit to the island.I had stayed at Tagoo Hotel before and decided to go back.It/s amazing how well they treat you there. It/s a family onwed hotel and everything is made to make guests feel happy and have a good time.The owners are always ready to give you tips of good restaurants to go, with different prices and types of food.Depending on the weather conditions they also tell you which beach to go to every morning, The staff is so efficient and always ready to help you with your needs.Rooms are confortable, clean, and have the Blue Mediterranean right there as you open the window.The swimming pool bar is a meeting point either for a drink or just chat, or both.Specially at sunset hour. The barman is always ready to offer you a glass of wine as the sun goes down.That means Hotel Tagoo has a wonderful view and the sunset is right there in front of you....... beautiful.They also organize a GREEK NIGHT for guests sometimes, when they try to teach guests a little bit of greek culture, greek dance, cuisine. It/s a good chance to meet people from all over the world, make new friends, and have a good time.The Hotel is quiet, and a great place to rest when you want. I am very happy wtih my choice and sure suggest all my friends to stay at Tagoo Hotel.It/s a peaceful, warm, friendly place to be, and made my vacation just wonderful.   Room Tip: ask for a room with a sea view - most of them are, but better ask See more room tips",0
"OK, first and foremost, the beds are the most comfortable beds I've had in Greece. The high level service is top notch, family owned and intimate environment. You'll make friends immediately unless you don't leave your room. You can't beat the view while you have a drink at the bar overlooking the sea.",0
Perfect place and wonderful sunset view:) the location is near downtown and give us free transfer from port or airport!!!!!! the staff also suggest us many perfect restaurants and beach for traveling :) we hope to come here again!..........,0
"This was the 6th time my wife and i have stayed at Tagoo and it was just as great as the other 5. Anna Yiannis and Jimmy are the best, The new pool guy Nikos is great and the breakfast lady Vikki is a treasure, We met old friends and made new ones .The guys from Arkansas were lots of fun. Till the next time,",1
When I stay in Mykonos I usually stay in the studios of Hotel Tagoo. So this is the first time I have stayed in the hotel. I had a nice large double room on the lower terraces overlooking the Agean. While Anna and her crew are always freindly and helpul there are plenty of places to go if you want to be alone. This was my first cooked breakfast in all my travels in the Agean so the Brits feel right at home! The funny thing is that when I go to the bar I always recognize faces from my last visit or the time before. Their repeat business must be huge. What better recommendation can you have?,1
"Hospitality is outstanding - they will make sure your taken care of. The rooms are traditional not ultra modern. The poolside view is great day or night (especially @ sunset). Walking distance to the old town. Breakfast is not extravagant but a good start to the day. Wireless is spotty in the rooms and the water in the room is not fresh water but sea water (salty), thus could be an issue throughout the island not sure.Would definitely return.Thnx to Anna, Theo, Jimmy and the rest of the staff for your hospitality!",0
"giving the fact that the hotel is awarded with the ""TA Travellers' Choice"" reference, I think, many of its reviews were more than just a little overrating. well, the first impression of this place is good: the swimming pool area has a magnificent view of the harbour below and the hotel looks really great on the pictures. but the first impression comes and go and you quickly realise that staying there makes you feel boring: the room is very basic, the bathroom is dated, the towels are stiff, the breakfast choice is below average... and there was no drinking water in the fridge. in my country people say: ""it looks like they tried to save on a box of matches"". well, I think, one or two bottles of water in the room wouldn't cost a fortune for the hotel, taking into account the fact that the tap water is too salty to drink but the nearest shop where you can buy water is 15 minutes away from the hotel. by the way, prepare for much walking since the hotel is located not as close to the downtown as it was expected. finally, Anna, the owner, can be a little annoying. don't get me wrong, the family who run this place seem to be nice people, but there was too much of Anna for me during this holiday. maybe, I'm just not used to such super-friendliness... in the end of the day, you understand that you got exactly what you paid for. therefore, next time for Mykonos, it would be a good idea to put aside a sum at least twice as much as it was paid for this accommodation, but get something more elegant and comfortable rather than a standard budget hotel.   Room Tip: the lower terrace seems to be lonely and desolate, try to get a room at least in the upper terraces See more room tips",2
"Not only is this place beautiful but the staff are what make it amazing! So kind and helpful, they sat down with us to personally explain the island and give us a brief history of some places. This was very much appreciated! The staff went over and above for everyone! The view from the pool is breathtaking, our room was spacious and had everything we needed. I could not recommend this place enough! If I'm ever lucky to come back to Mykonos Hotel Tagoo will be the place I stay!",0
"Anna and her staff were so welcoming and went out of their way to ensure our stay was comfortable and fun. Rooms and amenities were clean and top notch. Most rooms, pool, and bar had great views of the port harbour and sunsets were spectacular.",0
"Hotel Tagoo may only be 2* but the people there make it 5*! They're warm, welcoming and friendly. Anna made us feel right at home and kindly gave us a bottle of wine because there was a small mix up with our pick up, she didn't need to but it was so kind that she did.It's not a big and fancy hotel but it's not pretending or trying to be. It's small, homely and family run. The rooms are simple but clean, comfortable and spacious, all you need for a beach holiday.The pool area is gorgeous, with a stunning view over Mykonos town. It's the perfect spot for a delicious cocktail to watch the sunset. The breakfast is continental but tasty, no frills goodness.Anna and co go out of their way to make sure people enjoy their time at Tagoo and the Greek night is a must do if you're there. The dancing was a particular highlight!Can't recommend the hotel enough if you're visiting the island, will definitely be back in the future!",0
"It was our first time on the beautiful Mykonos island, and we've been so lucky, to spend these days in gorgeous Hotel Tagoo, home of Anna and her family! From the first moment on we felt like at home, met incredible people and had a great time! Perfect location, only a short walk to the town center, best sunset views of Mykonos from the pool.. Anna, the queen of hospitality, was always caring, helping, finding solutions, and being like a mum to us! we already know we will be returning next year and sooo proud being a part of this big Tagoo family!!",1
"The Hotel Tagoo is a wonderfully comfortable place to call home when in Mykonos. The owner, and her very longtime co-workers/family members really went out of their way to make our stay fun and relaxing. Need a car (I was strongly advised by friends against mopeds and 4-wheelers)? They'll get it for you. Want strong drinks at the lovely pool bar? No problem! But really, the best thing is that they make sure that your expectations are set.When we made our reservations, Anna emailed to confirm that my partner and I had a twin room, no view. I had tried to get a double with view, but alas the pickings were slim. I knew what I booked, but they still wanted to confirm just so I wasn't disappointed. No worries. We didn't get a double, but they had already put the two twin beds together so it might as well have been a king (with a slight wedge). The great: ALL of the staff, pool, deck, bar, view, location, and breakfast.The middling: Rooms themselves (but who wants to stay in your room in Mykonos?)The worst (from an American perspective): Bathrooms (typically small and dated), towels (hard/tough) and the tap water (very salty and not drinkable, but probably not their fault).I don't want to repeat all the other reviewers, and there's no way I can give the gorgeous pictures of the hotel and its amenities justice, but suffice it to say that people who stay at Tagoo, keep coming back to Tagoo. Evidently for years. That's saying something.",0
"This was my second visit to hotel tagoo with my daughter, having been at the same time last year. And I already know I'll be returning next year! Anna and her team offer such a warm welcome that you instantly feel part of the place. The location is fantastic - a short walk to the main town and the views from the pool over the ocean are breathtaking. A truly special place.",0
"We arrived many years ago as strangers, and return now as friends. This is a hotel like no other I can relate, run by the incredible Anna and Yianni and their family, who treat each and every guest more like family than customers. Anna takes time to care for each and every guest, and ensure that they know which beach to visit, restaurant to eat at, bar to drink in, shops to shop in...and everything in between. Her attention to detail is unlike anything I have ever seen.Mykonos is magical enough, but the Tagoo experience just goes so far beyond that. We have traveled to many places the world over and stayed 5* in most, but Tagoo goes beyond stars and I couldn't possibly ever consider being anywhere else when we are in Mykonos.Returning to Hotel Tagoo is like coming home to old friends, and we can't wait until next June!Love to Anna, Yianni, Jimmy, Nikos, and the team...our Greek family.",0
"This is the 3rd year now back at Hotel Tagoo and of course another fantastic stay with my Mykonos family!! Always feels like being home with the fantastic warm welcome and service offered by everyone. A perfect place to stay, close enough yet just nice enough out of the centre to be perfectly positioned. Hotel Tagoo is the best place to make your Mykonos holiday perfect. See you again next year Anna, Yiannis and crew :)",0
"It's simply Tagoo, with its wonderful people, great service and affordable prices.I discovered Tagoo by chance in early nineties, and since then I am a regular customer whenever I visit Mykonos. It is very close to the town centre but on a very quiet location with a great pool that offers wonderful views of the Aegean and brilliant sunsets. Jimmy and Theo are the greatest people who could ever work at a pool bar, Anna and Yiannis (the owners) are the greatest hotel owners I' ve ever met. Always helpful, giving the best advice to new customers concerning Mykonos attractions, cheerful, friendly and polite. A great family business with extremely reasonable prices, brilliant location, clean rooms, excellent service and quality.   Room Tip: rooms around the pool are the best ones See more room tips",0
"Wonderful Hotel, it has a gorgeus view at the pool with the Aegean sea at the back, the rooms are beautifully rustic, the personnel who works there become your friends and they are for you for any question or inconvenience you could have. It is located 10 minutes walking to the center of Mykonos, the only exhausting is to be back the hotel.The breakfast is a small bufffet but with all the basic food you should have. All the people who works there are soooo amazing, Ana, Rully, Nico, Vicky, Jimmy....I will miss you all...Definetely would come back!",0
"The hotel is very well located (10mins walk from Mykonos town) The room was very comfortable,the pool area is great and the view is stunning - the breakfast by Vicky was amazing!! All staff were brilliant, friendly and very helpful..... We will stay there again! Special thanks to Anna, the owner, for being so great (Greek night was fantastic) Thank you again for a great holiday! See you next year JC",0
This was my second stay at this great hotel. A very homely feeling and an amazing team of staff make you feel very welcome. The owners Yannis and Anna go out of their way to make your stay as good as possible. If you get the chance to go to the hotels Greek night I would recommend it. We will definitely be back next year!   Room Tip: amazing views from the sea view rooms See more room tips,0
"We just had the amazing stay in Hotel Tagoo one week ago. The staff was so friendly, so helpfull, so good at giving us tips on where to go. The view of this hotel is one of the best, really, i have been traveling a lot and I am sort of ""hotel junky"", but this hotel is really special. The only thing that i can dislike is that my vacation was to short, will deffinately return to this magical place! Thank you Anna and Yanni & Co. for everything P.S. The ""bell boy"" is really cute! :-) Check it out;-)",0
Hotel Tagoo was a great location beautiful staff and Anna the owner so informative on recommendations on what to see and do. Felt homely and most other guests were repeat visitors. Learnt to cook traditional Greek dishes and a few traditional dance moves,2
"Last September (9/2014) me and my husband stayed at the Hotel Tagoo at the high referral from a friend. Hotel Tagoo does not disappoint. Tonight we were talking about our great stay and shame on me for not submitting a well deserved positive review. In any event, better late than never. As the website says, you enter as a stranger and leave as a friend. Anna and Yanni are wonderful. They give you great recommendations that you should take for local restaurants and beaches. Anna organized a Greek nite party at the bar and provided us with home cooked apps and shared the receipe how to make fresh taziki sauce. It was great. The view is spectacular, the bar and food great and the rooms were perfect. It is a little walk into town so for the ladies you are best without the high heels. Drivers are a little crazy in general but you do get used to it. Just be careful walking. We highly recommend Hotel Tagoo and truly think a hidden secret. You certainly get the personal touch you don't get in the big hotels. Go and tell Anna we sent you :) Rob and Teresa",2
"This was our first visit to Tagoo. Our friends had been here before and said we would love it. We did!! Ana and her husband were great hosts and their staff excellent. Rooms were clean and comfy, the views from the hotel breathe taking. Walking distance to town. Oh yes at the hotel my wife learned traditional Greek dance and Anna gave a Greek cooking lesson. Was a lot of fun and great way to meet the other guests. We will be back hopefully soon with our kids :) Thank you",1
"Hotel Tagoo is a find on the island. Great location, easy walk to the town and close to beach transport. The rooms were comfortable, the view amazing. The pool and bar area was the perfect place to watch the sunset. All the staff were friendly and helpful.",0
"Our stay at Hotel Tagoo made our trip to Mykonos perfect. The friendly and hospitable staff will always go the extra mile and provide genuine care and personal service. The rooms were very clean and we couldn't feel that we missed anything. The breakfast is delicious and the bar has a great assortment of cocktails. Last but not least, the views from the terrace, combined with the authentic cycladic architecture of the hotel will be the cherry on top of the cake. We definetely recommend this hotel to anyone and we hope we'll be back next year.",0
"Second visit to Tagoo and welcomed back like old friends.Every amazing person who you meet at the Tagoo remembers your name and is happy to chat and interact with you, making you feel like the only person staying there.Rooms are spotless and well appointed. Location is barely 6-7 minutes from town and the view is how I imagine paradise to be!I've already booked a mini break in August and next year is booked for me too.Anna and her team are worthy of the outstanding reviews they have on here.",0
"This was our second time staying at Hotel Tagoo. It was like returning for a family visit. We knew a number of the other guests from our prior visit and of course the hotel staff who made us feel right at home. The property is always so clean and well kept. There is plenty of space in the common areas (bar, pool and breakfast room) for all guests. It is so much fun to share experiences with your fellow guests over breakfast in the morning or cocktails while watching the sun set. What makes this place so special is the people and the value. It is a perfect place to spend a week or longer while enjoying the beaches, bars and restaurants of Mykonos. We will be coming back again!!",0
"I have just returned home after 10 blissful days staying in the stunning hotel Tagoo and for the 3rd year running I am continuously bowled over by how amazing this place is!Anna, yiannis, Rulee, Nikos, Jimmy, Vasiliki, Leila & Ted are the best team EVER!! From the moment you arrive you are welcomed like family and it is the perfect place to stay for time on the island of Mykonos.The rooms and entire hotel is spotless, breakfast is a great start to the day which Vasiliki prepares brilliantly.Rulee is so lovely and offers great advise for places to visit.Nikos works so hard all day ensuring every guests needs are met! He deserves a medal!!Jimmy is the best barman... Ever!Leila never stops smiling and does a brilliant job ensuring the hotel and rooms are as spotless as they are!And the amazing Anna, as always is so welcoming, genuine, informative and caring! Her advise for places to visit truly helps make your stay perfect.The Greek night is a great way to meet other guests, watch Anna making a traditional Greek dish, food tasting and the dancing is excellent fun.Tagoo itself is paradise, but I feel that the team together are the reason I will always return to this hotel!",0
"I have lost count of the times I had stayed at the Hotel Tagoo but my welcome never changes.Although a two star hotel it has five star service it's so nice to go back year after year and see some old faces, love the improvements.Jimmys bar open all hours can't wait to go back.Thanks for a great holiday and lovely memories until next year Adios Jayne and Robert xx   Room Tip: Balcony rooms are lovely See more room tips",0
"We stayed at The Myconian Ambassador for three nights. It was my husband and myself and three teenage daughters. The rooms were clean, modern and beautiful with a great view of the ocean. The breakfast was delicious. The spa was beautiful with amazing treatments. The service was unreal with staff making sure you had everything you needed. The pool was so beautiful with comfortable lounge chairs and service galore!   Room Tip: Ask for a room on a lower level so you don't have to walk that far. See more room tips",0
"From the moment we arrived, the service was absolutely first-class. Every member of the staff that I dealt with was always friendly and helpful.I was there for four nights with my wife and son and the rooms were spacious and clean.We loved the pool and spent much time there. There was a good mixture of couples as well as families.Although we never ate dinner at the hotel, the breakfast buffet every morning was great. If you preferred to have your eggs poached, the staff would take care of that with no problem.The beach was steps away and the the front desk was always ready for you with towels and vouchers for lounge chairs. The umbrellas between every two lounge chairs on the beach were equipped with solar panels which afforded us the ability to keep our cellphones charged through a USB port on the pole. The beach area we sat in had its own WiFi.The hotel and its surroundings are beautiful. You will not be disappointed.",0
"We stayed at the Myconian Ambassador as part of our honeymoon and it was wonderful! Our room had a private jacuzzi, the included breakfast was great, and the staff was delightful. The beds are comfy and the bath products are Molton Brown...love it! I would highly recommend this hotel.",1
"From the moment you walk in, you will be IMPRESSED. Beautiful friendly staff, Grecian white decor and AMAZING food especially breakfast. Must try their fresh green juice for brekky. Only minutes from the beach for food and drinks. Will DEFINITELY be staying there again",0
"I cannot write enough about this hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with such warmth and hospitality by Virginia and Konstantinos and this continued by all staff throughout our 9 night stay. The service was beyond its 5 star rating! We were travelling with two boys, 5 and 2 and they made our stay seamless, no requests was too hard to fulfill, from preparing special meals for a fussy toddler, to providing medications for a sore tooth and even gastro!! Also, our babysitter Sevi was amazing and both boys took to her immediately. Thank you to George, Danny, Hercules, Konstantina, Leo and Apostoli at the bar - his dirty vodka martini's were the bomb. An even bigger special thank you to owner Vangelis, his level of professionalism and passion shined through, not only within his hotel but how his staff and guests responded to him. See you next year Anna Maria Constantinou",0
"hotel owners have put a lot of effort into ensuring the amenities in the room are suitable and practical. there was a sound system, Jacuzzi, soft lighting and plenty for our stuff. its such a romantic spot and not too far away from town and a 20 m walk to the beach. beach also has free beach chairs with usb phone charger dock. staff are so helpful. we had a great time. definitely worth the stay.   Room Tip: get one with jacuzzi facing ocean See more room tips",0
"We recently stayed at this hotel with 20 of our other friends to celebrate a birthday, everyone about this hotel is perfect and amazing. The staff have been amazing even before we checked in and replied to the many emails that I sent to assist in organizing our stay, they assisted us our ATV and Buggy Hire, an amazing dinner for 25 Guest and made us the most amazing special request cake. The staff are the all amazing and incredible helpful from the start to the end and the owner gave us very special attention. The rooms was big, spacious, clean and all that we could ask for. This is definitely the ONLY hotel that we will stay in Myconos",0
Four days at the Myconian Ambassador were not nearly enough... The hotel is fantastic and in a great location in Mykonos: close enough to get to the town if you'd like but far enough from the madness to be able to relax. The staff is by far the best asset at the hotel as they truly do everything possible to make you comfortable. We'll definitely be back!,0
Platis Yialos-is the best placed beach on the island-you can walk to Scorpios and Namos-or straight down onto the beach and eat at Yialo Yialo and it has the best balanced atmosphere. Great to have the choice though--the ambience of the Hotel bar overlooking the resort pool out to the sea make the decision a tough call each night on what to do. The resort bar and restaurant have been blessed by the aspect they offer. The restaurant and bar staff are superb at what they do. I had a month there and everyone I met there said the same thing--best service experience of anywhere they had travelled.   Room Tip: rooms closer to the pool are my preference- See more room tips,0
"From the moment our Kouretas family, Greek American, grandparents, parents and grand kids stepped foot on this property it was heavenly. Fabulous greetings that were always sincere, the beauty of the property and every moment was perfect. This stay will always be remembered and we will be back!The front desk manager was amazing and always made sure we were well taken care of and had everything we needed. The sleeping accomodations were arranged for our family perfectly in the 3 bedroom villa. The dining area with George, every day was relaxing and always arranged without asking. Our waiter Leo was kind and his service was exceptional. I can not say a negative thing about any person or moment at this property.   Room Tip: the rooms and property modern, simple and most beautiful See more room tips",0
"I was lucky enough to share my experience with a 10 year return guest of the hotel, Mr. Williamson, and it could not have been more spectacular. From the moment I was greeted at the airport with a friendly smile to the hugs given at my departure, the hotel and it's staff were absolute magic. The property is meticulously maintained with modern and sleek decor. The staff present well and are on point every minute of every day. You can get a hand crafted cocktail that could rival anything from the best mixologist or a dish with risotto and scallops that will make your mouth water. The breakfast buffet is unrivaled and includes everything you could ever want. The rooms are divine, dressed in white walls with heavenly beds and luxurious white linens. Each day, at our convenience, the room was cleaned and no detail was left unnoticed. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful at helping us book a yacht for the day and other activities/dinners. The hotel is also situated close to a happening beach with loads of additional restaurants/bars. Mikonos town is a short drive and the staff can easily arrange transport there (or anywhere else.... I suggest Panormos, Nammos and lunch at Kiki's). This place oozes luxury with a staff who embrace every opportunity to make your stay top notch and I can not wait to visit again next year! I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",0
"We are tough customers from NY and have been to many hotels around the world. Let me tell you, this is one of the best places we have stayed. The service, the food, the amenities and the views were all amazing (and I don't use that word often when writing reviews). Definitely going back.",0
Platy Yialos is the best location on the island you can walk to Scorpios and Namos. The best resort by far is the Ambassador hotel—the staff deserve our vote of being number one in our 3 months of travelling through the UK and Europe.You must go just to see the view from the bar. The barman is a class act and compliments the setting and they are the only venue on the island that serve keg fresh Stella Artois on tap.,0
"Such an incredible hotel, great to be back again. We were referred there by our friend Craig who stays there every year (i can see why). The service was impeccable, we were treated like royalty! The view from the bar (that now has fresh Stella Artois on tap.. couldn't find that anywhere else) is a view of Platy Gialos. Super clean and great food too. Best resort in Europe!!!",0
"We loved the hotel and the views were spectacular. The room was very comfortable and just the right amount of room. Virginia in Guest relations was absolutely amazing. She went out of her way to make sure we had a great time. We loved all the restaurants she recommended. Also, the restaurant at the hotel was very good including the brunch. What a spread!",0
"From the minute the hotel transportation picked us up from the airport our stay was perfect! The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. every time a staff member passed us it was with a smile and a ""hello"". The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is clean and filled with unique modern art. Our room overlooked the sea and was clean and functional. The pool area is amazing with comfortable lounge chairs and a great view. The breakfast is top-notch too. I'd recommend this hotel to any of our family and friends.",0
Stayed at Myconian Ambassador in May this year. It was the start of their busy season and the property was almost on full occupancy. The hotel is about 5-7 mins walk to the closet beach. The staff at the reception was very helpful throughout our stay and helped us with places to eat and visit. The breakfast was very elaborate and nice. The room was of decent quality. It had everything that you needed but it did not give a feeling of luxury. There was a minor issues with the housekeeping staff who would ring a bell to clean the room at 8-9 am in the morning every time and wake us up. All in all it was a good stay at this property baring this issue.,0
"Nice boutique hotel, understated and super service oriented. Wonderful breakfast, great food on lunch menu, all served with a beautiful view. Pool staff was stellar! Pool side service comes with surprises. Spoiler alert; complementary fruit skewers, free water in buckets, mini ice cream cones, sunglass cleaning and cold towels! Bartender made stellar drinks! Rooms were modern, crisp and clean, filled with wonderful products and the best hotel blow drier ever! Less of a criticism, more of a suggestion--the female reception uniform looks dated and takes away from the modern aesthetic., which includes cool art! We highly recommend staying here as it is a short trip to the town.",1
"There are no words to describe how amazing is this hotel. It is simply the place to stay at in Mykonos.The rooms are gorgeous, the poolside is lovely (just make sure to reserve your bed before breakfast!), food is great (rich in variety ) and you'd feel relaxed just sitting on your balcony! (The Mykonos syndromes )You must know though that some rooms are a bit far from the reception area (especially if your room is in the new building ) but you should be fine if you gave a car (which is needed in the island ). Far from the town (if u like to walk, but is a 5 min drive )If you have the budget for it, go for it! Worth every penny trust me",0
"The hotel was just a short walk to the beach, but we only went there to dine in the evenings.It was our third stop and I would say that Mykonos was probably the least suited to our tastes - Santorini and Crete were better. However, the hotel itself was lovely. We had a couple of minor problems which were fixed immediately. The receptionists were all lovely, as were the vast majority of the staff that we encountered. The barman was great and succeeded in making me the best whiskey sour I have tasted on any of my travels.For the first time in a review I am going to save my best comments for the lovely lady who cleaned our room. The room was cleaned to perfection at all times of day - what was most surprising was that we very rarely saw her! Everything we used was replaced immediately!One thing to bear in mind is that not all of the guests can be expected to be well behaved at all times - it is Mykonos and you can get the odd party animal stumbling back to their room at 4:30am to listen to some music.If we were to return to Mykonos then this would be our first choice of hotel, if only for the cleaner and the wonderful breakfast!",0
"Spent 7 nights as a couple and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel is very well positioned over an elevated hill, spectacular views of the sea. We were upgraded on arrival to a very large and well equipped sea view room. The staff is the hotel's strength, very welcoming and attentive, the bar is excellent and the food is very good, breakfast is served with extreme quality of food and service. The pool is out of this world,suitable for couples as well as youngsters. The beach, also very nicely equipped is a 2 minute walk with all the services one wants.The hotel is very clean and well maintained, management is excellent. The wi-fi is ok.An overall very nice experience without any complaints:) one day we'll be back I am sure :)Last but not least, the old town, the windmills, and the shopping area is a must see.",2
"We loved our stay at this hotel, nothing was too much trouble and the views and setting are marvellous - if you visit Mykonos, this should be your accommodation of choice! We ate at the restaurant and it was 5 star, the pool and bar are very nice and the spa was also a good experience. Located very close to the beach (a short walk) but elevated away from traffic and noise.Very special hotel.",0
"Nice surprise arriving to this hotel ! Perfectly decorated and super modern ! We loved to stay here (2 couples). It definitely made our stay in Mykonos a lot better than expected initially ! Rooms are great , breakfast 5 stars with fresh products, all the staff is well educated and ready to help! Really think it's worth the money !",0
"Amazing hotel, food very good, staff fantastic.My husband and I were very stressed when we came to the hotel and the staff managed to de-stress us within minutes upon our arrival.We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a jacuzzi tub.I would highly recommend this hotel.",0
"I'm not the type of person to write a negative review for any establishment... but our stay at the Myconian Ambassador, was just awful in every way.We booked this as our third stay while in Mykonos for two weeks, and it was without question, the worst by a landslide.My choice in leaving this is review, is solely to hope that no one spends their hard-earned money, the same way I did when choosing this resort.We booked this hotel for it's swanky modern look, as our other two incredible hotels, were more of your typical traditional Mykonos/Greece styled resorts.We were picked up from the Port in a Volkswagen, opposed to our other two stays which picked us up in Mercedes' limousines. We spoke to the friendly driver about our previous stays, and when asked how they rank among this hotel and, he indicated that ""there are nicer places to stay than this hotel.""As odd as I thought that was, he was right.We arrived at the hotel, which is in a bit of an odd location... Actually, a bad location. Sure it's close to Nammos beach, but the hotel is down a side street, across from the beach.As we arrived, there were two men throwing up in front of the hotel. No big deal; we've all been there at some point.Upon checking in, Virginia greeted us at the lobby, asked us for our passports, and handed us paperwork. When we handed everything in, she told us she would be back in a minute. Ten minutes passed, and I saw Virginia welcoming another guest. I didn't think much about it, because I figured she'd be back in a few minutes - but ten minutes turned into thirty minutes, and I then felt the need to ask for help from another member of staff.The member of staff sincerely apologized for Virginia forgetting about us, and handed me back one of our two passports. When I told her there was another, she scrambled around searching for the Passport... She went into the back, back into the front, asked other staff for help to find it... Searched through two large stacks of Passports... No luck... That went on for a good twenty (20) minutes...I don't think I should have to state, a hotel should not, and cannot, lose a guests Passport... Even if it's only for 20 minutes.. it is just absolutely not acceptable. The hotel manager, Mr. Konstantinos, came over to welcome us, apologize for the mishap, and offered us an upgrade to a suite - though indicated we can only stay in there for one night, and we'd have to move back to our original room afterwards; which to us, is a bit of an inconvenience, after all of our travels...The staff still insisted on showing us the suite, so we said we would take a look...Up we went.. one elevator.. down the hall, to the next elevator.. to the back of the hotel (which sort of looks like an undeveloped plot of land, with donkeys and roosters crowing)... up another flight of stairs, and literally ALL the way in the back of the property.We saw the suite; it was nothing special... In fact, it was less impressive than all of our other three stays while in Mykonos altogether. It had a small shared plunge pool. We were not interested.We went back to our original room, and they showed us all the modern amenities... Universal Adapters built into the wall, in-wall USB adapters, and so forth. Nice.We soon found out that none of the adapters worked; and only one of the USB adapters worked.Our shower was nice and modern, and the bathroom overall looked great.. until we looked closer. We opened up the package that included Q-Tips, and noticed they had been used and were placed back inside their package. Gross. The hairdryer was completely broken and didn't work.I had called to the front desk to ask for additional adapters, but never received a call back.We requested an ATV, but unlike the other hotels who had our vehicles delivered to us, we had to go the rental property to get it ourselves; another inconvenience. The property is buzzing with people all the time. I mean, a ton of people... We quickly lost that feeling of relaxation that had remained throughout our other stays. Our room was so far in the back, that during our stay, it was only cleaned twice during 3 nights. Our other stays had our rooms cleaned everyday, with a turndown service ever night.I made the mistake of shaving on day 1; which meant that my beard remains stayed in our sink and floor for most of our stay at the hotel; even though I complained to the front desk that our room had not been cleaned in 2 days.Breakfast in the hotel was okay at best, though we probably would've thought it was phenomenal had we not stayed at two better hotels prior to our arrival at the Myconian. Leo the server in the restaurant was great, I will say that. I found it annoying that in order to get towels (both for our room), as well as for the pool/beach, we had to request them and wait for them.Unlike our previous hotels, Myconian does not seem to have any pull or strength when it comes to getting their guests reservations. When we stayed at Mykonos Blanc, which was an incredible and amazing experience, when we wanted to have dinner at the best restaurants in Mykonos - they got us the best table, at the best time, right away. Myconian does not have that ability, so when we tried to have the hotel make reservations for us, they failed to do so. Afterwards we called up the Mykonos Blanc, our previous hotel, they were able to secure us reservations within 15 minutes. I went down to the restaurant a few minutes after breakfast had ended... maybe 10:32am, and breakfast ended at 10:30am. All I wanted was a coffee, and when I asked the server, his answer was no. I had to explain to him that I didn't care that it wasn't part of ""breakfast"", I just wanted to pay for my coffee and go - but he still insisted that I had to wait until pool service began. I'm on vacation and paying top dollar to stay at these resorts; I'm sorry, but no should not be a legitimate answer.At this point, I was furious... so I had it out with the staff, and demanded to speak to Mr. Konstantinos. He was very kind when dealing with me, and apologized sincerely, and was in disbelief of the things I was telling him. He offered to upgrade us to a suite again, but again, a bit of an inconvenience when we were leaving Mykonos within 14 hours. He then suggested that he would comp us a fruit platter, which I'm not sure if it was a joke, or a backhand.. When I denied that, he suggested lunch, dinner - both were rejected again by me. My girlfriend suggested that they provide us with a taxi to drive us to our dinner reservations and back - which he did arrange. He asked us if there was anything else he could do, and I suggested a discount to our stay/refund, as we were thoroughly displeased and unhappy with the entire resort and stay. Konstantinos then directed his staff to bring us champagne and coffee to us at the pool, but in poor taste, it was announced in front of all other guests lounging near us at the pool ""You don't have to pay for these""; verbatim.As we were getting ready for dinner, our shower broke, and flooded our room... They sent us towels to soak up the water (what type of service is that?).When we were heading to our dinner reservations they informed us that they were going to send someone to our room to fix the shower, but we told them not to (as it was our last night there, and I had my drone, and ~7,000EUR of camera equipment laying around the room).When we returned from dinner, Mike greeted me at the door and told me he'd like to close out our stay. I said sure, and he handed me a bill for 60EUR. I was nearly in hysterics at this point... after all the troubles (which only a handful are mentioned in this review), he had the nerve to hand me a bill for 60EUR.He was confused as to why I was laughing, and I informed him that he had some set of balls to hail me down to close out 60 EUR after all of this... he then realized how stupid he sounded, and told me not to worry about the 60 EUR... We then got into an argument, as I didn't want to feel like I owed this dump a dime, and I insisted to pay.I was told I would receive a follow-up email from the hotel to discuss a discount for all the troubles, but was surprised when I received a length email from the manager stating he'd like to invite me for a free stay sometime in 2017. I told him that I appreciate his unrealistic optimism and cognitive dissonance, and will give him credit when I write this review but that I would not be stepping foot into another Myconian property ever again.The hotel looks swanky, but it's a dump. I'm sure it may be nice if you don't stay at other resorts on the island, but when comparing, it was horrible and not worth the money.You are much much much better staying at Mykonos Blanc, Mykonos Blu, or the St. John.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Also, there are a ton of kids at the hotel.. the pool is not relaxing whatsoever.",1
"Truly an amazing stay! The staff is totally engaged and cannot do enough for you! Absolutely the most luxurious surroundings and ambiance from the bellman to the wait staff, In Fact everyone involved in the hotel! Dinner at the restaurant was superior and tastefully served. Come hungry because there are many surprises after you have eaten what you order!The rooms are spotless and absolutely stunning!The pool is like a dream and the view is so beautiful it hurts!Come see for yourself, you will not be disappointed!",0
"Wow what a wonderful hotel, I was initially supposed to be staying at the Mykonian K however that hotel was still being renovated. I've stayed at the Mykonian K on a few trips to Mykonos and add a separate review on my tour of the upgraded hotel. However back to the Ambassador. I was a little sceptical about staying there as it is a little distance out of the old town. I have always stayed in a hotel where you have the ability to walk to town. Seeing as the Myconian K was not ready I was transferred along with a bunch of mates at the ambassador. Well I was blown away. I had a spectacular room, spacious with view to die for. I stayed in the new wing and the room was very modern clean and airy. Balcony with the Med and yachts, who could ask for more. Pool deck is awesome!!! Take my advice alternate your days between the various beaches and the pool deck. One you save on paying the hefty tab for beach loungers and umbrellas. Ice buckets, thick pool towels, mineral water, fruit sticks, ice cream - non of which are free on the beach. Cocktails in the evening and the most amazing place to have a dinner out under the night sky. Breakfast is a real feast, I rolled out like a barrel every morning. Beach towels are available so need to pack anything extra. Hotel staff are awesome and friendly, housekeeping always ready to help. Two little niggles my room 525 didn't have a shower glass and was sort of a mini wet room. However it didn't quite work and you spent time mopping up the excess water all over and having to request extra floor tiles. The second being the spa, very friendly service and I use a complimentary voucher for the various pools. With the hotel modern and refreshed looking the spa was disappointing in terms of decor and could really do with a makeover. All in all, well worth the stay and will be back!!!",3
"My wife and I spent three nights at the Myconian Ambassador and loved everything about it. The hotel and the facilities are top notch. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Constaninos was especially amazing. He helped us with dinner reservations, taxis, car rental, and much more. He was truly incredible throughout our stay. Additionally the food at the restaurant was delicious. We ate breakfast there every morning and lunch one day. If you're looking for a hotel near a beautiful beach and a little bit away from the noise of Mykonos Town, this is THE place.",0
From the moment we arrived the hotel staff treated us like royalty. The property was gorgeous with stunning rooms and amazing views. The service at the pool was unbelievable and the food was excellent! I highly recommend this hotel for any vacationer visiting Mykonos! We will definitely be back! 10 out of 10,0
"Best views ever, have not been able to get enough of the magnificent views from any part of this hotel. The staff are genuinely friendly and want to get to know you. They all greet you every time they pass you and they are happy to assist you with anything you ask. Nothing is too hard. Very efficient. The rooms are clean and welcoming. The circular showers are magnificent as well as a novelty and the housekeeping staff are on the ball and unobtrusive. Breakfast and bar staff were also great. Food was fresh and tasty and variety was broad. I would totally recommend the day spa as well. Massages were great staff were professional and we enjoyed every minute. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I am sure to be back again for my next trip to Mykonos. Will miss this hotel dearly. Ask for a room with an outside spa, water is warm and views to die for.   Room Tip: Choose a room with a spa on the balcony See more room tips",0
"Room: Suite with private pool - well worth the additional cost, best part of our tripFood: very goodAmenities: great, main pool had a very relaxed feelStaff: Very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.Cons: they add €10 Euros to any taxis booked to pick up from the hotel, so trip to town costs €20 but the driver only gets €10",0
"This is an outstanding property. Every detail in the guest rooms has been thought through - from perfect vanity mirror in the bathroom, to generous closets, perfect bed and pillows etc. One cannot fault the food and beverage or the service. Location is also very convenient. Free transfer to and from the port is an added bonus. Stayed in a superior room with a view.   Room Tip: True Blue Panoramic Sea View. See more room tips",0
"Me and my husband were there for 2nights at this amazing property. It was something beyond expected, each and every bit of our stay was just marvellous. Words fall short to describe my experience with them. They upgraded our standard room with superior room with private jacuzzi for complimentary on jst a single request, all thanks to the hotel wonderful staff, all of them were so courteous, helpful and gentle! There was this guy from the staff Mike who was always available whenever we required any kind of help(even at the midnight) the room n jacuzzi was the best we have ever used in our life, just so dam comfy and breathtaking. The pool and the breakfast was more than excellent. And ya i went for spa also which was really relaxing and worth it. Whats more left guys? Just dont think, give it a shot. I would so so love to come back again asap. Loads of love n tons of thanks to the entire team.",0
"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and really enjoyed it. Hotel staff was very friendly and efficient – from the driver that picked us up at the airport, Nikos, to everyone at the reception and the wait staff at the restaurants. Check in/check out was quick and easy. Room was very nice, spacious, and brightly decorated in yellow with a nice balcony overlooking the sea. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom area was on the small side but good enough. There was a big safebox and a minibar which you could ask to be emptied to put in your own drinks/food, which we did. I think what we liked the most of this hotel was its convenient location: it’s only a 10 min ride from airport; there is a small market right next door where we got our waters and drinks; it’s a 5 min walk to the bus stop, and a 5 min walk to the beach – could not be any better.About bus stop – you can get a bus schedule from the reception. Once you get to the bus stop, there may be a queue, which may or may not be respected once the bus arrives. The bus has to make a u-turn in a tight space, and while manoeuvring it may disperse the queue. Purchase the ticket on the bus, it’s 1.80 Euro each way to Mykonos town. However, on the way back from Mykonos, if you return past midnight, the fare goes to 2.30 euros.About the beach – Platys Gialos. As a hotel guest, you have access to a free umbrella and two chairs on the beach, by the Notos Restaurant, which is immediately to your left from the pathway accessing the beach. Beware that only the last 2 rows are free for hotel guests. If you want to use the first 4 rows you will have to pay 15 euros/day. You can use the toilets inside Notos restaurant/hotel, which are downstairs inside. Beach restaurant – we tried two, Avli and Notos. We highly recommend Avli.Hotel restaurant – breakfast was very good, wide selection, fresh ingredients, eggs made to order and a nice selection of gluten-free items. We dined at the restaurant twice and both times we had a great experience – excellent food, great service by Danny and Leo and George, and beautiful views. Prices are a bit on the high side but worth it. We tried the scallops and octopus appetizers as well as the lemon risotto with shrimps and seabass – all were delicious.The only cons about this hotel: 1) they don’t have a separate section for non-smokers at the restaurant at dinner, people still smoke at the outdoor veranda which is semi-covered. Also during breakfast, if there are no seats available inside, you could end up in an outside table with smokers. And 2) the internet connection was annoying – we had to sign in everytime you came back to the hotel instead of recognizing it automatically. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and we highly recommend this hotel.",1
"We had a wonderful stay at the Myconian Ambassador. The rooms were modern and comfortable (and I loved the Korres toiletries provided). The views were wonderful, staff was friendly, attentive and helpful and the Concierge gave us great recommendations. We enjoyed relaxing by the pool, which was clean, pretty and had comfortable sun loungers. The breakfast buffet was extensive and tasty. Our package also included a Thalasso spa treatment which was super relaxing. We had this treatment on our last day at the hotel and we quite literally didn't want to leave after the treatment!",0
"Where do we begin- the glamorous entrance, 5 star hospitality, breathtaking views or the wonderful staff- this hotel is truly one of kind. As a frequent traveler, I've had my fair share of mediocre and world class stays but the Myconian Ambassador was the best to date. The breakfasts are fresh, the rooms are spotless, the views are incredible and the staff treat you with the utmost respect and honor. The pool is quiet and quaint with people servicing you at any moment in time. The location is exceptional- only 7 minutes from Mykonos town. The staff are always there to help you, suggest an amazing place to eat or call you a taxi ( which by the way- are the best of the best). The beach is also gorgeous. 2 minute walk from hotel with comfortable chairs ( which are also free) The most perfect start to our honeymoon. Trust me- just book you won't be disappointed.",0
"Beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Rooms were modern but comfortable, views were gorgeous and staff was warm, inviting and helpful. The pool area is beautiful and so very comfortable with great loungers and couches. Would definitely return here again.",0
"my daughter and I had two nights here recently - were upgraded from another hotel being renovated - hotel is absolutely gorgeous, really luxurious and the staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Room was wonderful with fantastic sea views and a Jacuzzi. I had a leg injury and staff were super helpful in every way during our stay. Breakfasts, restaurant, pool area, all first class. Great little area too. Thankyou for looking after us so well. we would love to come back one day.   Room Tip: room with Jacuzzi very special See more room tips",0
"Awesome experience!! Sea view was excellent from my room, The private pool was amazing, and the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff was tremendous; unlike any I experienced before!It is not directly connected to the beach, but the beach is only a 2 minute walk away! The amenities and amazing staff outweigh a connecting beach in my opinion!",0
"I had originally booked another Myconian Collection Hotel near Mykonos Town, renovations were not complete and we were moved (upgraded!) to the Ambassador in Platis Gialos. It was a very pleasant stay - great view from all the rooms, wonderful pool, pleasant spa, and complimentary airport pickup and drop off. The rooms were clean, the bed were incredible comfortable. The morning breakfast is included.Platis Gialos is a convenient place to stay in Mykonos. There is a decent beach with beach-front restaurants. The boat to Paradise Beach, Super Paradise Beach, and Elia Beach leaves from the town every hour. The Bus into Mykonos Town leaves every 30 minutes. Platis Gialos has a few convenience stores, a place to rent scooters or ATVs and a few ATMs scattered around. A taxi from Mykonos Town to the Hotel is 10 Euro. The Hotel quoted me 20 Euro for a taxi from the Hotel to Town, so I always took the bus into Town and a Taxi home.   Room Tip: Get a room with a hot tub on the balcony - the views will be amazing. See more room tips",0
"Don't think about staying anywhere else! outstanding accommodations, warm reception, fabulous food and service. The pool is large and uncrowded, with beautiful lounge chairs with umbrellas. Great location - 3 minute walk to the beach (where they have arranged free lounge chairs for you too) and 5 minute walk to the bus to Mykonos town. Gorgeous hotel, immaculate and full room service twice a day. Can't rave enough!   Room Tip: We splurged for a room with a hot tub on our beautiful deck. It was really worth it. See more room tips",0
"I can't say enough about this place. It's in a perfect location, it's got a great pool that overlooks the bay, the staff are adorable, the food is fantastic, the rooms are brilliant (especially if you've been lucky enough to be upgraded to a room with a hot tub on your balcony!) and the price is very reasonable. Staff bring you little extras almost every hour as you sit around the pool. Breakfast is excellent with the usual buffet spread but then you order your eggs fresh cooked anyway you want them. Be friendly to the staff and they will be friendly back and treat you well. The bus into Mykonos town is 10 mins and easy to pick up and only costs €1.80. A cab home is about €15. The hotel is a 10 min taxi from the airport and the hotel runs a free shuttle service. You might think this hotel is a little pricey but trust me it is completely worth every penny.",0
"We were relocated to this hotel due to our original hotel being under renovation. At first we were very sceptical as we wanted to be close to town. However, on arrival I was completely blown away by this hotel. The manager kindly upgraded us to rooms with jacuzzis for the inconvenience of moving hotels which was amazing. The view from the hotel, absolutely breathtaking. The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast, the best I had on my trip to Greece. The hotel, rooms and pool were outstanding. I actually ended up enjoying the position of the hotel, a short walk to many beaches and an easy bus ride into town. I have not one negative to say about this hotel, was honestly the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Thank you to the amazing staff for making our stay in Mykonos unforgettable!",0
We stayed at this hotel for a short holiday in June with the entire family. It is very close to the beach where you can rent sun beds for the day and enjoy various water sports or just sit by the sea. There are also a few restuarants and bars along the beach if you don't want to go into Mykonos town. The hotel also has a nice pool with lounge chairs and bar service. The rooms were very clean and tidy and good size with nice amenities. We had a small terrace with a beautiful view of the sea. I also had a massage at the spa which was wonderful. The spa is very nicely done. We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and it was good but ate out the other nights. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again if in Mykonos!   Room Tip: Some rooms offer a private small pool or spa if desired. See more room tips,0
"We had a beautiful 4 night stay here as part of our 3 week honeymoon. Very good location, close to good restaurants, bars and of course the beach. 10-15 min bus ride into town - very easy to do. €10 taxi ride home after dinner. Food - breakfasts are very very good; snack food while at pool is also good quality. Staff are top notch, Konstantinos the hotel manager is world class - such a gentleman and provides first class service; Victoria on front desk was incredibly kind and helpful; Leo in the restaurant stands out for his excellent 'can-do' attitude. Personalities like these make hotels like Mykonian Ambassador stand out from the rest, globally. Only thing I'd note is that children are allowed to stay here so don't be surprised if you have some complaining kids lounging next to your lounges while their parents take 2 quiet lounges on the other side of the pool for some quality peace time!Thanks for having us. Alex",0
"Superbly run, brilliant staff, great location, exceptional food - all in all an excellent experience. Room spotless, comfortable bed, good pillows, very nice bathroom, on 6th floor overlooking pool and views out to sea over the roof tops.Highly recommend.In particular would say the staff were beautifully trained, were passionate about their jobs and could not have been more helpful or pleasant.",0

"We were transferred to this hotel after our first advised that they had not completed renovations. Initially this hotel looked great and reception was very helpful, meal the first night in the restaurant was excellent BUT our room was no finished! We had builders walking past the balcony all day so that we could not use it. Then came home on the second day to find the room a mess all doors and windows open and they were installing a new shower screen and a new mirror! No warning! Seemed to get very vague comments back when we complained. Not Happy!   Room Tip: Check out the room first! See more room tips",0
"We absolutely loved this hotel! We have just returned from a 5 night stay and can honestly say this is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in (and we’ve travelled a lot). The staff are unbelievable (every single one!). They could not have been more accommodating, nothing was too much trouble and they were all super friendly, polite and professional at all times. The pool staff were the best, it really was top quality service The food in the hotel was great and reasonably priced. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and we were upgraded to a room with a mini pool on our balcony and the most amazing view. Location is fab too, a short drive from the town and really close to the beaches This is a luxury hotel and I’d definitely recommended to everyone holidaying in Mykonos, I would not stay anywhere else! We’ll definitely be backThanks again for the most amazing service and for making our trip so special",0
"As soon as we arrived, we felt like we were at home. This not only looks like a five star hotel but feels like it- the service was impeccable! Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. On arrival, we were excited to find out that we had been upgraded to the passion suite with outdoor Jacuzzi. This room was one of a kind! We enjoyed a couple of days just lazing by the pool which was very comfortable... while you sit there, the waiters offer you complimentary water, juices, and smoothies. The hotel is a short walk to the beach and many restaurants including blue myth and avli tou thodori(the number one and two rated restaurants in Mykonos on TripAdvisor). Overall, had an amazing stay here and only wish I could have stayed longer!",1
"The location and the Hotel are great, but what it makes it outstanding is the service.Everyone, everyone, from the Manager to the last employee have a wonderful attitude. The view, the service, the swimming pool area, breakfast, the Restaurant; ""the best""We loved it.",0
"Wonderful, wonderful and wonderful... i havnt seen a more friendly and courteous staff anywhere... absolutely loved the hotel... lovely setting, superb rooms, had a free upgrade of our room, kudos to whole of the team of myconia ambassador.. keep up the good work.. you guys made our trip to Mykonos a memorable experience...",0
"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across Europe, Americas, Australia and the Burj! We honestly believe this hotel is the best. Rooms are fresh and enjoyable, beds comfortable, room staff friendly and super efficient and views are beautiful.The pool area is pure luxury. The bar and restaurants with a super fresh and relaxed ambiance serving wonderful food and refreshing drinks.But the best part of staying is dealing with the staff. They are all super friendly, genuine, very helpful and always at your service.We will be back and will certainly recommend it to everyone we know.Thank you everyone at Ambassador.",1
"Hands down this is the highest level of service I've received in any establishment, anywhere in the world. It is evident this is ingrained in the culture of every employee in the hotel, from the pool attendant to the hotel manager, the most common English speaking phrase we heard from every single one of them was ""of course"". This is the answer to any request, any time. We had been traveling for 2.5 weeks by the time we reached Mykonos so were so happy to see such a breathtaking hotel with the amenities needed to get some much needed R&R. If I didn't feel guilty about not seeing the city on our short stay I would have never left the resort for a minute. The pool and most notably the comfy beach couches and chairs were where I took a nap several times a day. And when we wanted, we were steps away from the local beach, about a 5 min walk. The food for breakfast and at the pool were amazing and I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were for food/drinks considering how upscale the hotel was, I was expecting to be gouged but not so. Made to order eggs and gluten free options for the breakfast buffet were included without extra charge - another pleasant surprise. Do you want a fancy coffee with breakfast? Of course! The hotel took care of every detail for us, dinner suggestions and reservations, on time and reliable transport to & from the resort and they even helped to arrange our transport to our next port of call in Athens and an early check in for that hotel. Who does this? We never touched our bags after we handed them to the bus driver at the port. Even the driver that took us to the airport after our stay pulled our bags all the way into the terminal and to the front of the line. We left feeling like spoiled rock stars. A couple of minor cons: 1) Even the check in process is white glove with your own personal attendant to show you the hotel and a welcome drink with comfy chairs while your check in processed. However, after traveling all morning we were tired and just wanted badly to get into our room and relax. The tour of the hotel with an attendant that we were expected to tip was a bit annoying to us. I understand what they were trying to do and it would have been a nice touch if we weren't so exhausted. Just keep this in mind, once you get to the hotel it is a bit of a production before you get to your actual room. 2) Mykonos is a party town and attracts the type of people that like this atmosphere so even though there were many families and couples staying at the resort there were also a lot of groups there to party and the walls in our room were pretty thin. 3) I was excited to see the gym after another Trip Advisor person had described it as ""state of the art"". That is not accurate. The gym is very large by hotel standards, it is not the usual closet with one treadmill, but within the space there is not much more than the basics. I thoroughly appreciated having it and would not complain about access to multiple cardio machines, bosu balls, free weights, yoga mats, etc but was disappointed after the descriptions I saw by other travelers. Again, all minor cons and nothing that negatively impacted our stay. I would definitely come back again - fantastic hotel.

"Upon my trip to Greece we found this hotel on TripAdvisor and the pictures do not do it any justice even as beautiful as they are. This hotel is superb all the way around from courtesy airport and port pickup and drop-off, to the extremely helpful and courteous staff, to the delicious drinks at the poolside desk and the delectable food at their evening restaurant. There are no bad views from any room in this resort and they make you feel like a movie star the second they pick you up on your arrival. Very short walking distance to the beach and the local restaurants. This is a one of a kind, very modern and clean resort that I would highly recommend to anyone.   Room Tip: Get a room with a Jacuzzi or the infinity pool as it is greatly relaxing at nighttime. See more room tips",0
"We recently did a girls trip to Greece and stayed at this beautiful hotel! We island hopped and this hotel was by far the best one we stayed at. From the staff to amenities you can't go wrong. The girls at the front desk were even helpful with recommending great places to eat! They're even affiliated with an ATV place down the street in case you want to rent ATVs for the day. Stay here...you won't regret your decision!Happy Travelers,Jill, Avani, Puja, and Trupty Patel",1
General standards of customer experience are rising throughout the hotel industry but this place just lifted the bar even higher. What an amazing stay. The building and facilities are wonderful but it is the staff that really make the difference. From the moment you are collected at the airport to the welcome from the fantastic receptionists in their elegant white uniforms right through to the attentive and friendly bar staff and waiters and even the cheery cleaners you feel like everyone is there to help you have a good time. Everything about the hotel was perfect. It's not a budget location by any stretch of the imagination but it is so superb that it feels like great value for money. Loved every second.,0
"We booked 10 nights in the Mykonian Villa Collection. I was therefore somewhat surprised when on our transfer from the airport our driver (who turned out to be the owner) told us in a very relaxed Greek way that we were now going to a different hotel!! Our original hotel was hosting a conference and they had another venue that we would prefer, The Ambassador. Call me a traditionalist but I prefer to make such decisions for myself. We were however being treated to an upgraded room. Despite my initial misgivings I have to say they did us proud. We had a lovely big room, private terrace and plunge pool. Result! We went the last two weeks in May. Week 1 was fairly quiet. The staff, who were super friendly and good fun to chat to, had plenty of time to look after us. We had the choice of the all the tables for breakfast and dinner. It was fab. Spa was good. Gym was good, had it all to ourselves every time. Everybody helpful. Couple of times they forgot to make up our room but they did immediately once we reminded them. The food was fab. The hotel is expensive but you do expect it in a 5 star. They insisted on checking our mini bar everyday which seemed a little pedantic. Week 2 was a little different. The hotel got busier. The staff were looking a little harassed but we're still attentive. The pool beds ran out of towels and the staff were too busy to notice. Breakfast was heaving on our last day and people were waiting for tables. I guess my point is go in the middle of May and your experience will be more chilled and slicker. What would improve it? A kettle in the room. Hotter coffee and tea at breakfast. Replacing our beach towels, removing the American women who was briefly filming some dumb celebrity show on the neighbouring balcony. That's it - But when you're saying that sort of stuff you know you've got a great hotel. For the most part the staff were as good as I've ever seen. Def recommend it - Even better when it's quiet.",0
"We really can't provide enough superlatives about this hotel. Here is what we loved:Easy transport to/from the airportGorgeous, clean, well designed rooms, pool area and spaStunning view from hotel balconyGreat location near the beachFood was incredible - both the breakfast buffet and dinner (poolside, so romantic!)Insanely comfortable bedAttentive, proactive and helpful front desk staff",0
Don't know where to begin. From the moment we stepped foot to the time we left we had nothing but smiles and an amazingly wonderful staff! Everyone is so sweet and helpful. Whatever you need they will make sure to help you. When we arrived we were given cold refreshing towels and juice while they signed us in. Once we got to our room they brought us champagne and also had complimentary cookies and wine in the room. The bed has to be the comfiest bed we have ever slept in. Georgina was our hostess and whenever we had a question or if we needed to call our guide she went ahead and took care of it all for us so we didn't have to worry about it. The bellyboy Mike was so funny and helpful we had issues opening the room door a few times and he kept coming and was so nice about it and not annoyed at all. The bartender Apo - short for something I can't remember stayed open late for us even though there was no one there and never rushed us or felt like we were bothering him. One day we stayed by the pool basically all day and they passed free water and treats like smoothies and ice cream cones. There breakfast buffet is a huge spread and offer champagne as well. Lastly my last day I needed some stuff for my monthly visitor that came unexpected. When we were checking out they got me a bunch of things and medicine to take with me and didn't charge a thing and were so discreet about it. My husband and I truly enjoyed it and already said if we come back we are staying there :)We probably won't ever be able to enjoy another hotel again we were given a royal treatment and felt so spoiled ! :) beautiful place wonderful staff !!,0
"I have stayed in some really nice places in my travels... Dromoland Castle in Ireland among them. This was simply the best. We were the first two guests to walk through the door this season and we felt like celebrities from the moment we got picked up at the airport. Top-notch all the way. It will certainly not be the last time we stay here. If I could give it a higher rating, I would...and I don't say that lightly.The highlights:- The staff was simply amazing. Not just at reception, or at pool side, or in the restaurant. And not just a couple of them. They were all excellent and have set a new standard for me to measure by. Whatever they are paid, they are worth it and more. It's a beautiful property, but it's the people working there that makes this a next-level hotel and a place you WANT to stay at.- they will make any wrongs right. Face it, nobody is perfect. If you have any problem at all, discuss it with the staff. They will do whatever is in their power to accommodate you.- The hotel is beautiful, clean, and bright. Our room was ridiculously big and I think the shower ruined me for every other hotel I will stay at. The property consists of multiple levels since it's built on a hillside, so can be a little confusing to navigate. You get used to it quickly.- A 10-minute walk to the bus stop gets you up to Mykonos Town, so do not let the location in the south deter you from staying here. There is a path that serves as a shortcut that reduces the time even further. Be sure to say ""hi"" to the donkey on the way. It's about a 10 minute drive or so.- 2 organized beaches within a 10 minute walk (5 for the closer one). Shops and food are available. The one place we ordered from has a beach menu and the food was excellent.- a nice, quiet, relaxing place to get away from it all. Seaside rooms have beautiful views. Wi-fi is good (always important).- make sure you eat at the hotel restaurant at least once. A little pricey, but oh so worth it...There are a lot of hotels on Mykonos to chose from. Many of them are probably cheaper. If you are doing something on a budget, I understand. If you have a little extra and want a FIRST-CLASS experience all the way, this hotel is a sure thing and worth every euro of the price. I cannot wait to visit again.   Room Tip: Get a room with a sea view if you can. See more room tips",1
"My mouth is still wide open from the experience. The service is top notch and the hotel is one of a kind. Hardly ever can you truly travel to a place where all of the amenities are just fabulous. The decor, pool, dining, spa, rooms and service were spectacular. Staying here was just as lovely as venturing out in Mykonos town. We split our time with our own jacuzzi on our balcony and being down at the pool. You can get as much sun as you want or be comforted reading a book in the shade.One of my favorite routines was working out in their STATE OF THE ART gym before venturing down to breakfast and finishing up my morning by the pool. I could do that everyday! Not sure when I'm returning next but I have to get back here soon. This time for a 4 day stay at minimum!Thank you to the staff. I've fallen in love with Mykonos and this property. No need to go anywhere else. My holiday in Mykonos will always be here <U+2764><U+FE0F>",1
"This was one of those hotel stays where you are genuinely sad to leave. Excellence oozed all over the place at this hotel -- from the complementary airport transfer, to a gaggle of people always at the front desk waiting to help anyone with anything, to the gorgeous pool area and rooms. The location really is a 2minute walk from a great beach (free sun beds available via the hotel). It was a tough daily decision though whether to go to a beach or stay at the hotel pool area, which was very well laid out and had great food and drink options. I did not know about the champagne breakfast buffet before my visit, and that was a NICE surprise!! I have to say the cherry on the sundae was the service. This staff is SO well trained, so friendly and warm, I couldn't help but smile all the time. Special thanks to George, the restaurant manager who really went above-and-beyond to make my experience special and ensure that I will remember this hotel for years to come. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone.   Room Tip: True Blue panoramic view had a truly beautiful panoramic view; I spent a lot of time on that balcony... See more room tips",1
The hotel had an excellent service that states from the welcoming at the front deskRooms are very clean and spaciousAmenities are very goodPool is wonderful with an amazing services and excellent food and beverage The hotel has a shuttle from and to the airport and from and to the townAnd easy and free access to next door beachThe spa is good They have a gym with very professional machinesThe hotel decoration is impressiveThe service is top excellent,1
Rooms recently renovated very clean and room cleaning team fabulous. Restaurant lovely views and great choice and price reasonable. Easy walk to beach and cafes. Town 10 euro by cab. All staff accommodating and wishing to please. Rooms do not have kettle but can request. Ask for room with view. You'll be pleased.,0
"The absolute best customer service and hospitality that we have ever experience before. Hotel is a beautiful place with very modern and Greek style. The rooms are specious enough and every one of them has a fantastic view of the ocean. We really felt at home here! The staff is very accommodating and is eager to help you with any question, especiallyIn regards to what to see, do, eat. The pool is great and you have a panoramic view of the sea from there as well. I would highly recommend this hotel to any who would like to experience Mykonos in luxury.",1
"Wow, Wow, Wow. I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel, and I am speechless. It's truly incredible. Firstly we were greeted at the airport with a private complimentary transfer, and were welcomed into this very modern, chic and trendy hotel by the polite, warm and friendly staff (all dressed in white). We were then seated and offered complimentary cold drinks and before being shown to our rooms we were given a tour of the hotel. Room and Amenities Our room was just amazing and nothing like have seen before. I couldn't believe they offered Molton Brown cosmetics (shower gel, shampoo, body lotion)!! They also had a coffee machine (which you have to pay for so be weary), blowdryer, towels, shaving kits flat screen, and speakers to play music from your iPod or iPhone on (much to our delight).We had a room on the first floor, and unlike other hotels where first floor really means that you are on the ground floor, we were high enough to get a spectacular view of the ocean but not too high so that you feel like you are in a multi-storey flat (see pictures for the view from our room). FoodWe only did bed and breakfast because i like to try different foods in the local restaurants during the night, BUT The breakfast was more than adequate, was very tasty and would suit all needs. StaffOh my goodness!! This really made this hotel a 10 for us. The staff including the front of house, restaurant staff, bellboys, and the cleaners were probably some of the nicest I have come across in my travels. They were always ready to help, they always had smiles on the faces which really makes a difference and made us feel at ease fro the very beginning of our stay. Thank YOU ALL... LocationThe location of the hotel was also very good, its a 2 min walk to the local beach where you can sit on a sun lounger for free . BUT as their owned by the restaurants you would have to buy something which is a minor issue, since most people like to order a drink, cocktail, water and even food when laying about. There are lots of restaurants to chose from on the beach front which is very convenient, especially for those like us who only done b&b. I'd recommend Alvi, and Yialo Yialo!! You're a short taxi into Mykonos Town, but it costs €15 each way which after a day or two becomes very expensive so it's best to get the bus which is a 5-7 min walk for just €1.80. However the buses stop quite early on, i think the last is at 9pm which was not very good for us who often stayed out in town past midnight at the local bars and clubs, so you're then forced to pay for a taxi, which coincidentally is cheaper in town then getting it from the hotel at just €10. There's lots and lots of good shops in town, and i would recommend a visit during the day. They also have lots of greek tavernas and little eateries too which you should give a try. We did the trip to Delos which was organised by the hotel, and is good if you like history etc... Overall, even though this hotel was just superb i'm not sure that I would visit Mykonos anytime soon. It really is a party island and for that reason it lacks in culture, and personally I like to have a balance. It's also rather expensive, which although this was something we did anticipate, i think they do push their luck on some things especially the prices at restaurants and hops in town (make sure you barter prices in the shops in town). However, it does have some lovely beaches, the food delicious, the views are like none other, and again as in other parts of Greece that I've visited the people are some of the most friendly in the world. Everyone should visit at least once....   Room Tip: Room 104 was the best!!! See more room tips",0
Superb hotel overlooking the Platis Yialos bay. Very well located next to the beach and a few other beaches you can reach by walk. 10 min from Mykonos centre. Great facilities. Professional and welcoming staff always willing to help. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!,0
"We have just returned from a fantastically relaxing break to the Myconian Ambassador, we were picked up from the airport in the shuttle and it was a quick journey to the hotel where the reception staff were incredibly efficient and helpful with organising our room. We were given a complimentary room upgrade which was very nice. The room itself was nice, the bed was the comfiest bed I have slept in, it made it incredibly difficult to get up in the morning for breakfast. We had a bath in the room which was a good touch. The only small downside to the room is that you can quite clearly hear your neighbours in their rooms, and also that the housekeeping team although they are fantastic, don't always pay attention to the do not disturb light outside of the room. The communal pool area is superb, the staff there are fantastic and work really hard to ensure that you have everything that you need. The sun loungers are comfy and the pool bar food menu is good too. Overall we were impressed. Make sure you go down to the beach front and eat dinner at Avli Tou Thodori we had our best meal of the trip there.",0
This hotel far exceeds anything you could expect. Friendly! Courteous! There for anything you need! Go above and beyond to meet your needs. Close to a fantastic beach and great restaurants and bars. Absolutely loved it! Going back for sure!,0
"This is a lovely hotel. We were greeted by staff from the moment we stepped off their private shuttle from the port. You are invited to sit down and have a cool drink and register in a relaxing lounge. The women are all dressed in chic white suits giving this a luxury touch from the moment you walk in. The staff were excellent. Very nice, extremely accommodating. We had dinner in the dining room, and this is where the service was just average. I had to ask to have my sparking water refilled, and when I asked for an extra piece of bread they ignored me, however I realized this was due to a language barrier. The food was excellent and especially the dessert. The reason I say it is not quite 5 start is due to the rooms. I think I was spoiled as I stayed at two 5 star hotels prior to this , on the same trip in Greece, so had much to compare it too. The rooms have a nice airy feel about them. However the feel is more of an IKEA furniture store. They are going for a minimalist decor, however they missed the ""luxury"" touch. The chair in the room was dirty and needs a refresh. There is a shower in a circle which was cool looking but not luxury. There are no bathtubs. My coffee pot required someone to help turn it on and it took him some time to realize you had to turn on a switch in the back (they should just leave it on, filled with water like the other 5 star hotels where I stayed). There is an issue with the noise in the hallways. People return to their rooms late and talk normal and maybe a little raised voices and you can clearly hear them from the rooms at 2:00am. Not sure what they can do about this, however a sign might be nice to advise people to be sensitive to others sleeping and not to talk Loud in the evenings. There is a younger crowd staying here where noise is expected I guess. This is a lovely hotel with some luxury touches in the public areas, however not throughout the hotel and not in the rooms. The spa is very nice. I would try another hotel out next time here, and maybe pay more as I want luxury. I might sound picky , however I am a decerning experienced traveler who knows luxury. Oh I forgot, great views.",1
"When you feel fancy from the pick up port of the ferry, you know the hotel is going to be amazing (they had a fancy sign).Upon entering the hotel, immediately you feel the luxurious qualities this hotel has to offer. From the white chic interior and exterior to the cycladic architecture throughout, this is the epitome of a luxe hotel in Mykonos, Greece.The staff was also wondering and helpful. Not once did I feel we were of bother any time we had a question. They were also very inviting and a pleasure to deal with.Our room. It was AMAZING. White, minimal open floor pan with a view worth a million dollars. My jaw dropped as soon as the door opened. If this could be my master suite when I buy a house, that would be great. lol.The pool area is really nice for when you want an ""after the beach"" swim because let's face it, you're in Mykonos for the beaches!Breakfast was included with our rooms and it was probably one of the best breakfast buffets I've had in all my hotel-breakfast-buffets.There is also a shuttle walking distance away (5 minutes or less) that takes you to Mykonos town. It's not free but it's pretty cheap and runs all day. Ask the hotel for a schedule.One of the best hotels I've stayed at, even better than Marina Bay Sands in Singapore (to give you a comparison).",0
"Best food in Mykonos (the restaurant is great), amazing pool, very nice and kind stuff.Kostantinos is taking care of everyone and makes you feel at home.Great location (close to the beach) and very quite by night.The room are very modern and just renovated, with amazing view....The spa is amazing (not very cheap ... by the way)the hotel is simply the bestAlessandro Frati",0
"Truly fabulous hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with handshakes, welcomes, cool cherry juice, professionalism and genuine hospitality. Everything was gloriously white and all staff were well-trained and helpful. Our room was amazing with views out over the sea and our own private sun lounges on our own private terrace. We loved it!Annette and Rob   Room Tip: Ask for a sea view and a private terrace See more room tips",0
"From the moment you arrive at the airport (they have a luxury bus that picks you up at arrivals) until your checkout, you're pampered in every possible way. Staff goes over your expectation and do everything they can to overcome your needs. Can't wait to go back and meet again the new friends I made there. Special thanks to Marilia, Natalia and Apostolis.",0
excellent hotel. well located. superb service. everybody super kind and helpfull. rooms are paradise. food and attractions really good.pool and pool service excellent. view one of the best on the island,0
"We loved everything about this property. It was close enough to the beach to take daily strolls to the area reserved for our hotel and to visit the great little restaurants. It was far enough up the hill for incredible views.The service was the best part of the experience. We were treated royally at every turn...""May I clean your sunglasses, Ma'am?"" ""How about some sorbet to cool you down?"" The pool area was gorgeous. The food was stellar - one of the best buffets we encountered! A first class property - if only I could have stayed longer...heavy sigh...",2
"Amazing hotel.... The team helpful and professional.My son had an amazing time. On the expensive side but great food, good selection for breakfast maybe they can change the variety daily as if you staying more than a week you get bit use to it the same items. They offered us a DVD player but no selection of DVDs little improvement there but one of the ladies recommend a Channel with movies every night at 9 which was very helpful, one that note very limited TV Channels the rooms can do with a little refurb as comparing to the rest of the hotel are bit old.Great amenities and friendly housekeeping We will be back   Room Tip: Great amanities See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed here for vacation in late September. I had stayed here years ago prior to the renovation and loved it...now it is spectacular! The property is very chic and provides a very romantic and relaxing environment. Our room was an Ocean view with a pool which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had sun from sunrise until about 4 in the afternoon when we moved over to the main pool. Very hard to swim, as the nights had cooled down considerably and the water was very cold, but the water feature was great to have. We had a great view of the full moon during the time we were there. We arranged for a private car from the airport. It is a very quick ride, and may not be necessary for some, but it was worth cutting through the crowd and getting to the hotel quickly after a long night of travel. The staff was OUTSTANDING...ALL staff from the front desk, servers and hosts at the restaurants, retail shop clerk, spa employees, to the lovely people who cleaned our room. Everyone works really hard to make sure you have the best experience. They want you to be happy and will do everything possible to make sure you have a wonderful experience and provide great service. The food was EXCELLENT!!! While breakfast was huge and offered many selections, dinner was just incredible. The pool offers a fantastic view to the ocean. The spa was very relaxing. My husband and I did a couples massage and I came back later and did the Thalasso spa treatment. Really enjoyed! The Thalasso pool area needs some maintenance, but I believe that is on the schedule to be addressed in the offseason this year.The only downside was the smoking from guests at night along with parents who came to the bar/restaurant area with their kids and did not watch over them as they were being disruptive. That's hard to take when you have a hotel trying to establish one environment and the guests clash with that image. Even with the minor issues, not the hotel's fault, the positives so greatly outweighed any negatives. It would be nice to have a hotel in Greece of this caliber institute a no-smoking policy.Room Tip: All rooms have views, you cant go wrong with any room at this property   Room Tip: Room with pool is a must.

"We just returned from an 8 night stay at this lovely boutique hotel in Mykonos which was just great! The attention to detail was very impressive. This started at our airport pick-up, right through to our airport return. The staff were very helpful and if they couldn't give you the answers immediately they made sure they got the answers. The staff gave excellent service and always with a smile and very friendly. Its location is a 10-15 min. walk to the Old Town and a driver is available to take you at night between 8 and 12 to and from. The housekeeping and cleanliness was to a very high standard. The breakfasts were amazing with lots of choices. We would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a stay in the Old Town of Mykonos.",0
"My boyfriend and I just left a 2 night stay in Kouros. The entire staff was friendly and accommodating. We were welcomed with a hotel tour and a refreshing, complimentary drink while we waited for our room to be ready. There are several stairs throughout the property that you will have to navigate to access the public areas, but this seems to be common in this area. The pool deck is beautiful with great views of the town/sea and the lobby has very modern decor. The room itself I found to be fairly basic. Also, our sunset and sea views from the balcony were obscured by tree limbs, so I was definitely disappointed by that. The hotel is a close walk to town. It's uphill on the way back, but not too bad if you're in decent health. If you choose to stay here, I'd recommend that you upgrade your room and rent a car or scooter if you want to see different areas of the island without spending a lot of money on taxis. I couldn't help but feel that I could find a better ""value"" for my money since there are a ton of hotels on the island. I'd say look around a little more before deciding on this one, but if you stay here know that the staff will do all they can to make your stay pleasant!",0
"Excellent service with friendly staff. Pick up and drop off arrangement to fairy station worked very well for us. Very tidy with good swimming pool. Breakfast was excellent too. If we go to Mykonos again in the future, we would stay here for sure. We left this place with lots of good memory.",0
"My husband and I stayed at Kouros for 4 nights and can't say better things about this hotel. From the complimentary pick up from the ferry port to our welcome champagne drink, all of the staff were beyond accommodating and sweet. The staff at the front desk were helpful in recommending restaurants and booking taxi services when we needed. One night we had trouble getting our air conditioning working and someone came to help us within minutes after calling. Service at pool and restaurant was great, they even kept bringing us waters throughout the day and we didn't even have to ask for it. We saw the owner and her son in law who runs the restaurant many times throughout our stay and both were very friendly and pleasant. Hotel is about a 10-12 minute walk from the town. The onlydownfall is the road to get there is very dark with no lights at night but hotel does provide a free shuttle service most days from 8-midnight. Rooms are nice, bright, modern and clean with beautiful sunset views from balcony. No bathtub which was a bummer and the shower was kind of strange but otherwise perfectly fine. Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. It was a perfect combination - water views and beautiful grounds and also close proximity to town.",0
"There were 13 in our group and the staff at Kouros could not have been more accomodating. Upon arrival we had booked a champagne welcome on the champagne deck - amazing service, views and canapes. Our room was amazing with patio area for sunset views. All the staf - front desk, bellhop, wait staff were very friendly and eager to please. When my husband and I asked for ideas on lunch in town and what beach to take our scooter to - 2 girls at the desk took a lot of time and thought to suggest just the right places for us - they were spot on. Next time in Mykonos, we will stay here for sure. Thank you Kouros staff!",0
"Great boutique hotel with modern facilities. Enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is very close to the town centre, restaurants and activities. The food and view from the pool / dining area is beyond incredible, as well as the service. Wonderful staff, spotless rooms. Had a chance to talk to the owner and the staff.",0
"We spent 3 nights at Kouros and do not have a single thing to complain about - it was everything we expected and more. The rooms were meticulously decorated and views were beautiful, the amenities carefully chosen and on point, the breakfast buffet (with build your own omelette!) was a treat every morning, the pool and gym excellent - we were waiting on hand and foot. They got everything right - from the fluffiness of the towels and the down comforters, to the individual WIFI routers in every guest room - the best internet hands down on our entire European trip. Most importantly, the service, for us in great part provided by the brilliant Krystalia, was top notch. All our needs were met swiftly and competently, she made us bookings, gave valuable recommendations and was thoroughly helpful. N.B. there is complimentary port / airport transfers from the hotel - which was very helpful indeed. Kouros is a short (at times up hill) walk from Mykonos Town - it is what we considered to be the perfect location - close enough to walk to town on a whim, far enough to avoid the noise, crowds and traffic. Kouros was the best part of our trip to Mykonos, we could not recommend it enough.",0
"Hotel staff are the best, treat guests as royal families. The rooms are beautiful with wonderful view to the sea. Breakfast has a wide variety and is situated by the small beautiful pool. Would definitely go again next summer.   Room Tip: suites are great See more room tips",0
"We recently completed a 12 day visit to Greece and Mykonos was one of the islands we visited. Kouros Hotel was a perfect picture of what is called a boutique hotel. Perfectly maintained, superior service and very very kind and helpful staff. They arranged for everything from the rental car to come to the hotel or the best spots to visit. I can not think of one negative point about this stay. We had a very nice suite for our family of three with private balcony and perfect water views. Over all the best hotel we stayed at in Greece. They also provided complimentary shuttle to and from the airport or the port which in the island is a definite plus.It is about a 10-15 mins walk to the area of restaurants, clubs and shops and taxis are not easily available. It is very peaceful at night since it is away from all the party action.",0
"Great location, very comfortable (suite 49 , private terrace and jacuzzi), fantastic staff, delicious breakfast and the restaurant Narcisos, good food, cozy and elegant. Will be back next time in Mykonos!One fact to know for whom it's the first time , the island is very windy and sometimes you don't want to stay at the pool or the terrace because of the wind.",0
"This was our third visit to this amazing hotel. Perfect location for walking into Mykonos Town for all the wonderful restaurants, beautiful rooms and amazing staff - most of whom remembered us from our last visit in 2014. Leo the bar manager even remembered our drinks order - now there's service!   Room Tip: All rooms have sea views. See more room tips",0
"Recommended by friends to stay. Nice hotel with great views. It's a decent walk to town centre. Seems to be nicer hotels closer to the town centre but more party places with lots of activities around the pool - here, more peaceful and couples. Recommend a standard room - the suites are a waste having the extra lounge space (no tv in lounge). Ask for a small balcony.",0
"I can't say enough about the staff and property at Kouros. The driver for the hotel was waiting for us when our ferry arrived. When we got to the hotel, the staff greeted us with warm smiles. Although we were a large group (12 people), they made each person feel welcome and took the time to ensure everyone knew about the local beaches, city, etc. The rooms were spacious and impeccably clean. The pool could not have been more gorgeous. We even got the treat of having practically a private dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food was amazing and came with a great explanation of the ingredients and how to have the ""perfect bite.""Thank you Kouros staff for making our time in Mykonos so memorable. If we return to the island again I would absolutely stay at this hotel. Erin Payne",0
"We stayed with our two children for 3 days. Everything was perfect and the staff were particilarly friendly, polite and helpfull. I would recommend Kouros hotel to anyone. It was a very pleasant experience.",0
"The hotel is located on a hillside, the rooms are very contemporary with clean lines and fixtures, the views are to die for! As a comparison, we started at the King George hotel in Athens and the Aigialos hotel in Santorini and we liked Kouros the best of all.",0
"Always a perfect stay here, they go above and beyond at the reception/front desk. Pool service staff was a little confused, but Leo is the best was there the last time 3 years ago and one of the best servers ever. Stayed at pool villa and was completely happy, would always recommend.   Room Tip: Pool villa is the best See more room tips",0
"My husband and I just stayed at the Kouros for our honeymoon. We chose the hotel through a personal recommendation and we're pleased to say that the Kouros exceeded our already-high expectations. The property was stunning, the ocean and sunset views were unbelievable, and the service was 5+ star. The food at breakfast and at Narcissus restaurant was excellent. Personal attention and care was felt throughout our stay. Every hotel detail was well thought-through. The rooms were beautiful, immaculately clean, and full of extra amenities. The staff at the front desk was extremely professional and ensured that every one of our days was enjoyed fully, and proper reservations were booked as needed. Thanos, one of the owners, was especially wonderful in taking special care of us. Without hesitation, we would return to this hotel again and recommend it to all our friends. Thank you, Kouros Hotel! We are still dreaming about our stay and our wonderful time in Mykonos.",0
We stayed at the kouros hotel July 11-14!!!!! Can't say enough wonderful things about the hotel. The staff was amazing and so helpful and informative with all our questions. Breakfast was amazing. The close proximity to Mykonos town is also a huge plus!!!!! Would not think twice about coming back. Thanks kouros hotel!!!!!,0
"We have a wonderful stay at Kouros Hotel during June. The staff, services, breakfast, room, pool etc was amazing and I can not find fault with anything. The close proximity to Mykonos town also means that you can walk everywhere if you want to dine, shop or explore Mykonos town. Would definitely recommend the hotel for couples looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.",0
"As always the kurous hotel and staff are excellent, nothing is a problem , staff are friendly , professional and have a heart, ie, nothing is too much trouble.We have stayed here for 7 years and will always go back. The rooms offer superb views and they are impeccably clean and serviced twice daily, one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in, you are given personal service",0
It was not my first holiday at Kouros &Suites Mykonos but special this time after the changes like the champagne deck the complete renewed Spa just wonderfull .... all this small details create a special feeling for me at this place ... you can relax be yourself ..Enjoy ...it starts with the perfect breakfast select your favorite dish on the a la carte menu but no extra cost ! And at night the amazing restaurant with the best vieuw ...and a menu with GRANDE CLASS I GO BACK ! it is the best place and a perfect perfect ! Service Luc Bex,1
"The 2 ladies at the reception desk during the day were fantastic and so helpful. Although the hotel is situated a 20minute walk from the old town, the views and staff make it all worthwhile. They have a shuttle service for night evening trips to and from the main town. Would stay here again but be mindful that it is perhaps worth hiring a scooter/car to travel if you don't like walking on the road shared with viechles that come very close for comfort on the way up and down the hilly and curvy roads!",0
"I spent a week at Kouros Hotel from 21st June and from the moment I arrived I was transported into peace and tranquility. The reception staff are amazing, always willing to help and always with a smile, even though I saw some people treat them in a less than courteous way. The hotel is spotlessly clean and quiet. The breakfast, although buffet style again reflects the air of calm that reigns over Kouros and certain items are cooked to order. The pool area is lovely and all the staff throughout the hotel are friendly but professional in carrying out their duties. Unfortunately I was ill whilst I was there but I could not have wanted for more care and attention from everyone. If you want loud music around the pool and disruptive guests, go somewhere else - Kouros is a beautiful, peaceful haven. Thank you to everyone who made my stay so enjoyable.   Room Tip: Best views are from upper floors See more room tips",0
"I stayed at Kouros with my girlfriend on June 28th, for a week. As soon as we arrived we could tell that this was going to be special and it did not disappoint. The staff at reception, John (the bar manager), Joanna and Tassos all provided fantastic service which made it extra special. I couldn't recommend this hotel any higher. Rooms always spotless and any thing the team could do for you they always would. 5* hotel with a 7* service. Thank you!!!!!!",0
"Where is the 10 Star button??? Kouros was amazing in every way. Management was attentive, the rooms are outstanding, the location is ideal for walking to the town or to get to the port for day trips. The amenities are outstanding. Management was extraordinary, and greeted us personally when we arrived. The breakfast was the best we had in all of Europe. The spa was a perfect way to spend our last day. We used the gym on a daily basis. It was quiet and clean. The pool was utter bliss, and the champagne cocktails were divine. There were no kids here during our stay, which made the stay even nicer. Every one we met - from the shuttle driver (who will bring you to town and bring you back in the evenings...and also port pickups and deliveries), to the front desk, to the pool staff and the bar staff....EVERYONE was most gracious, and hospitable. They advertise this hotel as a journey to serenity....and that is exactly what it is. Reserve your room....you won't be disappointed.   Room Tip: All rooms face the sea - every room is divine See more room tips",0
"This smaller hotel is all about excellent customer service, amazing food, breathtaking views of the Agean sea and cleanliness. I've traveled all over Europe and this is the best hotel I've ever enjoyed. The staff is helpful and friendly, as well. EXCELLENT job, Kouros!   Room Tip: definitely go for a balcony room with a sea view. it's so worth it. especially upper level. See more room tips",0
"From the onset, this hotel and staff were outstanding. Hotel- modern, comfortable, stylish, with many wow features.Pool and bar- so beautiful you never want to leave.Restaurant- outstanding chef with some of the best food on the island, and exclusive to hotel guests.Room- stunning, with a private courtyard and views, we had a jacuzzi which was great in the morning and late evening.Staff- their advice was wonderful, on which beach to visit, which restaurants to dine at, where to go for walks ect. They made our stay very special.",1
We absolutely enjoyed our stay here! John the manager and his staff is a delight to speak with and provided excellent service in all capacities. The views are stunning and the pool is a dream. We were 3 women traveling together and our room was more then adequate. Don't miss the breakfast!,0
"Pictures don't do this hotel justice. Some major points: Service - Excellent. From the concierge staff to the restaurant. Everyone is extremely attentive and helpful. Small little things that really made our stay that much more enjoyable, from wine and appetizers waiting in our room, to the shuttle service that was always available. Really, just incredible service. Pool - Great, a few days we opted to sit by the pool over going to the beachRooms - Beautiful, clean, maid service came twice daily. Location - Town is a short walk, and you have a beautiful view! We had an ocean view room with a beautiful balcony. Food - Amazing! Not only do you have a breakfast buffet with a huge variety of foods, but you can also order off the menu from pancakes to egg white omelettes. Excellent food. We also ate the restaurant for lunch and dinner once, and the food was fantastic. We would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Mykonos.",0
We stayed for a week in early June. I spent some time researching hotels on the island and this one kept popping up. It's a relatively expensive hotel but the positive reviews were encouraging so we booked. A complimentary minibus service collected us from the airport and delivered us to reception. They went through lots of info about the island and Mykonos town before showing us to our room.The room was spacious and pleasing with a great view over the bay and sunset. The bathroom could use some extra lighting but was otherwise fine. The bar and pool area were great for sunbathing and relaxation where the attentive staff made sure everyone remained well hydrated. We never felt pressured by them just well attended to. Breakfast each morning was a buffet type with plenty to choose from. The food was great and there was no shortage of it. Meals and drinks through the day were relatively expensive but in line with most of Mykonos town. This year they have installed a 'champagne deck' above the bar. This is a private area you can effectively hire by purchasing champagne. Its very pleasant but the champagne is way too overpriced which I feel put people off. We didn't see anyone else use it during the week we were there. Maybe it will be busier during peak season but if they made the cost of the champagne more realistic then more people would likely use it. Better still just reserve it for an hour and recommend that at least a cocktail per person is purchased. The spa was also very pleasant but again an opportunity to take more money from customers. I haven't been to a spa before where you have to pay additional costs to use the sauna and hot tub. Given that no-one was using the spa I feel this is another missed opportunity to draw people in. In fairness we were given 15mins complimentary use of this after being initially put off by the cost. The reception staff were very friendly and courteous with nothing being too much trouble for them. They helped us arrange car hire (which we had no issues with) and even provided us with towels to take to the beach which was a nice touch. They seem to have thought of most things people will ask in advance which was quite impressive. Overall we loved our stay here and would like to return one day.,1
"Such a beautiful hotel in many ways. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble.The location is ideal, just a short drive or a 10/15 minute walk down to the pretty town.We were a party of four women and for us it was just perfect and a great choice for couples. Not sure it would suit very young families though.This was our second visit & hopefully not our last!A BIG thank you Kouros x",0
"A great place to stay. It is a little out of town... a 15 minute uphill walk from the nightlife and restaurants... but that can be an advantage... it is peaceful and quiet at night, and great place to relax, tan and read during the day... however if you do want to dine or party in town, the hotel provides a free car service from 8pm to midnight. The rooms, food and pool are great, but it is the staff who really make this place special. They really do go out of their way to help, and to make sure you are happy... right from the reception staff through to the cleaners.",0
"We arrived at the hotel after being picked up by them from the port, a free service and were taken to the pool area for our welcome drinks where we enjoyed to bottles of sparkling Moscato which was lovely. All the room have amazing sea views, the staff are super attentive and it has a real relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend this fab hotel. Breakfast is simply divine too.",0
"A very situated and we'll run affair. Positives are the staff, the pool with view and very attentive yet not in your face staff. The breakfast and food was very good. The rooms were fine. We had a bathroom drain issue which was fixed immediately when the hotel was notified. Easy walk to town although coming back is a little uphill. Can we a little windy in location which can mean sitting around pool without a shaded Recommended for a stay.",1
"This hotel is by far my favorite during my visit to the Mykonos. The level of refined detail to cleanliness and design in the suite was impressive. The staff, food, pool, ocean view, service was luxurious and effective. It is also an easy walk to town. Love this place.",0
"The Hotel is located on the cliff and has a fantastic view not only from the rooms but from the lobby as well as the pool side restaurant. The place is not big and that was the best part. The staff is friendly and the arrangements are great. The room size is good enough however, the bathroom could have been a little bigger. Overall the experience was amazing.",0
"Kouros was the perfect way to end our Greece trip. My husband and I got married in Santorini and headed to Mykonos as our final destination.The staff was extremely accommodating and extremely friendly. During check in we mentioned we had just gotten married. Little did we know while we were getting our welcome drinks, they had upgraded our room for FREE. The room had a private jacuzzi. They also decorated our room with flower petals, welcome snacks, bottle of wine, and a bag of goodies. My husband and I were so surprised, thankful, and overwhelmed by their kindness and generous gestures from the hotel. We had two other couple friends who were there and they also enjoyed Kouros very much.Also, they have an amazing breakfast buffet and the nicest servers there. Be sure to try their restaurant there….it was delicious food. Don't forget they have a gym so if you want o put in a quick workout you can do so. :-) Thank you so much Kouros for giving us the best customer service. You guys made our trip the best trip ever! We are def. coming back to Kouros and have already recommended it to our friends and family. THANK YOU THANK YOU! Besitos!-Lily Nguyen and Andres Avalos",0
Travelled as a party of six ladies for my friends surprise 50th birthday trip. The staff went out of their way to keep it a surprise from the birthday girl and were first class from the start to the end of our holiday. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Everything was impeccable from the food to reception to the waiting staff and driver.They made our holiday special. Special mention to Costas who catered to our every whim. We will all return.Location is great and you can just spend your time looking out to sea watching the comings and goings of all the cruise liners and ferries. The hotel driver will do drop-offs and pick-ups into town from 8pm-12am which is brilliant.We will all be back.,0
"For my first trip to Greece/Mykonos, the search for the perfect hotel began about 8 months prior to departure. My research on hotel reviews kept bringing me back to Kouros Hotel and Suites, so the choice was an obvious one.I am a stickler for attention to detail, cleanliness, comfy beds, nice amenities and great service...Kouros did not disappoint!!!From the moment we (my sister and I) arrived, we were treated with such happy, gracious, attentive courtesy. The entire staff...the receptionists, the shuttle driver and the adorable wait staff, were so professional and did everything they could to insure each day was filled with impeccable customer service.We visited the hotel in mid May (early in the season) so the hotel grounds and the rooms were in pristine condition. We had an amazing room with 2 balconies facing the bay/port. The restaurant and bar served amazing food and cocktails. The daily breakfast buffet left nothing to be desired...soooo yummy!We learned from some of the staff that the owners of the hotel, pay for room and food for their staff during the 6 month season the hotel is open, and each of the staff members say they felt part of the family and thusly return yearly to work with a great attitude!I definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be back!Thank you Kouros",4
"Everything from the moment we arrived was pure excellence. The staff are incredibly friendly and professional, and they catered to our every need. The views are stunning! And the food is delicious. We loved the hotel so much that we considered changing our itinerary to stay a little longer. We will definitely be back! And I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mykonos.",0
"We really loved Kouros Hotel from the moment we arrived. The staff were very nice and provided excellent service. Each and every person went out of their way to make certain that we had everything that we needed. The hotel lobby is beautiful as was our room. It was very clean and every detail was very thoughtfully planned. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast buffet each morning. I tried two of the spa services and they were very nice. The location of the hotel was perfect for walking to town. Staying at Kouros Hotel made our stay in Mykonos one that we will never forget. The only negative was the car rental company that they suggested for us. When we turned the car back in, some how there was damage that we did not see when we took the car. And the cost for repair was only 50 Euros!! Who can fix a huge scratch in a door for only 50 euros?? I would not have even mentioned it, except another couple who was checking out at the same time that we were had the same situation a mysterious bit of damage also appeared on their car. This is not Kouros Hotel's fault, however with the level of service that Kouros provides, we expected them to suggest only reputable car rental companies.",0
"Everything about kouros suites hotel is amazing, from the decor to the excellent service of its staff. From the moment you arrive at kouros, you feel you are in a very relaxed environment and the views are amazing. The staff cannot do enough for you but in a good way and had the balance just right. They definitely made our stay the most relaxing we have experienced and the food choice and quality at breakfast was unbelievable. Complimentary service to and from the airport and town was also great but the short walk to the town from the hotel was also nice. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be making a return visit. Nuttall2717",0
"Our trip was to celebrate my daughter's graduation, I chose Kouros because of its wonderful location and accommodations. Kouros exceeded my expectations - the view was priceless, the accommodations spotless and very comfortable, the location was a nice short walk into Mykonos and when we didn't walk their driver was happy to take us. The food was amazing both delicious and beautifully appointed. I tried many new food items and loved each more than the other. There are no words to express my gratitude to the caring staff. My daughter fell ill and they took care of her as if she were royalty, fixing her special soup. When we arrived home she had to have emergency surgery. Thank you Kouros staff for being so kind and caring!!! We hope to come back to enjoy more of what Mykonos has to offer!!   Room Tip: Chose a room with a balcony over looking the water - the view is breathtaking at sunset and you will... See more room tips",0
We were extremely happy with Kouros hotel while staying in Mykonos. They have a pickup and dropoff service complimentary to and from the airport/port. They have breakfast included with your stay and the food was great. The service was exceptional. The room was very clean which made my stay extra comfortable. It is also walkable to the Town (about 10 minutes). Rooms have balcony's to sit and enjoy the view/sunset. We ordered room service and the pasta was great.   Room Tip: All the rooms are great views. See more room tips,0
"I really don't have a bad word to say about Kouros! It's beautifully designed, very well thought through for what guests will need and is very near Mykonos Town. But the thing that really blew us away was the service. I have honestly never had better service anywhere and I have stayed at places double the price. You get to know the staff and they get to know you - they are incredibly thoughtful and attentive. They are always thinking of what would make your holiday better in the smallest ways. For instance, when you arrive at the pool they bring you over glasses of water and keep topping them up. On our final night we were enjoying a drink on the terrace when no-one else was there and a handyman was having to do some work on the pool, we were not bothered by it in the slightest - but then two free glasses of Prosecco arrived and they paid for the drinks we'd already had. It's little considerations like that which mean we would return to Kouros in a heartbeat.",1
"This was my first trip to Greece/Mykonos. I traveled with my sister, who did much research on accommodations. I cannot say enough praise for the Hotel property, which was impeccably maintained. The restaurant with excellent food (great job John!) and service. I can't say any one meal was the best, but I am certainly missing the Greek salad and the buffet breakfasts. The hotel staff ( driver, receptionists, wait staff, pool waiters, bartender and spa technicians) were all very professional, attentive and detailed orientated not to mention warm and friendly. They contributed greatly to the wonderful experience. I definitely felt that they were part of the caring family who owned the property.Overall an amazing experience, one that I would highly recommend and am eager to return to!",1
"I loved everything about this hotel. The staff were welcoming and helpful, going out of their way to answer our questions and make us feel comfortable. Breakfast was lovely. The rooms were spotless and the beds comfortable. The views from every room are stunning. Poolside service was wonderful and attentive and the food very tasty. The hotel is situated outside the main tourist area, which I much preferred. The walk to and from town took all of 10 minutes and was quite pleasant. All in all, this hotel was a gem and a highlight of our trip to Greece.",0
"We were delayed by the strike in Greece and only got to stay in Mykonos for 12 hours. We almost diverted our plans due to the strike, but we were so happy that we stuck to our short stay at Kouros. The hotel was so friendly and accommodating...the room was perfect! We almost stayed the entire time in the room - it was THAT good! We will return to spend more time in Mykonos and definitely stay at Kouros.   Room Tip: Great view of the water and very close to shops and restaurants See more room tips",0
"We recently had our first trip to Mykonos, and stayed at the Kouros hotel and suites. Our stay was first-class in every respect, but a few things must be high-lighted :-- first and foremost the staff - each and every one is wonderful - from reception (where they graciously answered every question we had), to breakfast (discreet but impeccable service), to the pool attendants, to the driver - well done!!- the location - the views from the hotel are to die for, especially at sunset - but also the views of the hotel from afar are very impressive; a fairly easy walk into town, although traffic can be a pain, and I'm sure this gets worse in high summer - but the driver provides a useful shuttle service to the edge of town- we only ate at the hotel for breakfast - but this was delicious, with some times varying daily - and was served by the wonderful staff with great pride- the rooms are spacious and well-equipped, with good air-con and wifi - we also had a delightful balcony, and shutters which closed out the morning sunshine",0
"Kouros Hotel is a very nice hotel located close to Mykonos town with wonderful views over the bay.We had a suite for 3 people and it has wonderful views over the sea and the sunset (except for a few cruise ships which block the sunset sometimes) and room and bathroom were large enough for the three of us.Hotel is nicely decorated and very clean. It has a nice pool with sea views next to the restaurant where breakfast is served. Breakfast was very well appointed, many options and well served.Service is extremely nice and helpful, probably one of the best things of the hotel.I had a few minor comments: more electricity plugs are needed in the rooms, our room had some leakage from the bathtub, TV was not working when we arrived to the room (it was sorted shortly after) and water has a strange color when it rains. Nonetheless, none of these things really bothered us and I would come back to this nice hotel!!",0
"We had changed hotel bookings twice before we finally booked Kouros, largely for the sea view from the rooms. Considering that we spent most of our time at the hotel sitting outside the rooms looking out at the sea with a glass of wine in hand, we couldn't have been more pleased with the choice of hotel. The views are to die for. Don't miss the sunsets.The service, right from the reception to the restaurant staff to the room service, was excellent. A sumptuous breakfast buffet gave a great start to the day, (esp the deliciously refreshing strawberry juice) and the chef was very accommodating to cook us food of our choice for dinner when we wanted something out of the menu. The helpful staff, esp Dimitra and Kostas, with a ready smile on their faces, were always available to fulfil a request, any time of the day. (We did wonder when they took time off!) The hotel itself is located at a short walk from the town centre, and in the evenings has a shuttle service to ferry guests to the town. One concern I did have was the lack of any safety railings, esp if traveling with young kids as we were. We couldn't take our eyes off them for a second, since the hotel is situated on a hill and is in levels. There was free Wifi but probably due to the wind, it was a little low in the rooms. We had to go to the lobby to get a more stable connection.Apart from that, we had a lovely stay at Kouros, and will definitely go back.",0
Excellent hotel. Staff is very courteous. They took very good care of us. Right from checkin to checkout every thing was smooth. We had an early checkout at 6.30 am and the receptionist offered to serve us an early breakfast in our room as the hotels regular breakfast at coffee shop would begin only at 8.00 am. No hotel till now has ever offered to till now. We genuinely appreciate this kind gesture.,0
"the best staff ever.they are great ,they do more than you expect from them.hotel is perfect in every aspect. rooms are spacious,and they made upgrade for one room.food is very nice also,and good greek food.near mykonos town,and driver can get you their helpfully with no charge   Room Tip: go for this hotel for sure See more room tips",0

"First of all one ""must"" visit Greece for a holiday. It's a beautiful place with lovely beaches and restaurants.. fantastic people make your visit better. This hotel, kouros where we are staying is an awesome property. The view is outstanding.. little Venice is 10 minutes by walk .. the hotel restaurant has a beautiful sunset view.. to top it up, the staff is so well trained and hospitable and pamper you all the time.. I give this hotel and staff a ***** ( five star) .. In short.. if in Myconos stay at kouros.. attached are few pictures of the property and the view from the property..",0
"The view is fantastic , the rooms are spacious and lovely.The best part is the staff - they are friendly and go out of their way to help you out!

"Visited in June 2015 with family. Hotel staff was kind enough to meet us right off the boat. They were well-mannered and took care of us from beginning. Amenities were nice, especially liked the bathrooms and balcony. Look forward to coming back one day soon.   Room Tip: Try the breakfast buffet! See more room tips",0
A perfect hotel to stay in Mykonos. We loved the fact that we were so close to Mykonos Town but away from the crowds and the noise. We loved how clean and tight was everything together with the modern mediterranean style of this boutique hotel. Amazing pool with a good selection of cocktails that you can enjoy at the bar. Absolute fabulous place to stay!,0
"Loved this hotel and amenities! The rooms are a very nice size, the views are spectacular, and the staff was fabulous. The staff bent over backwards to help with everything we needed. Also, the pool area and food were great... and the breakfast was just amazing....what a great start to each day:) Walking distance to the town, so we didn't need to use our car. We just loved everything about this resort!   Room Tip: The hotel is built into the mountain, so you'll have to walk up or down stairs to get to most ro... See more room tips",0
"My partner and I stayed at the Kouros hotel for 5 nights in early July of 2015. The hotel is well situated at about 10 minutes walk from the town center, and breathtaking views of the sunsets over the sea. The hotel is built into the mountain-side so has some steep steps up to the top, but there is also an elevator that can be used. The pool area has a great loungey vibe with a well-stocked bar!The staff onsite were very helpful in planning our trip, suggesting a car rental service and various beaches to visit on the island. The onsite restaurant is fine for one night but with so many fabulous restaurants in Mykonos town you probably don't want to have more than one meal there.Mykonos is a wonderful place to visit for couples or families. For gay couples, you will find a very welcoming island that provides the opportunity to party until late, or ignore all of that and just enjoy a relaxing vacation.",0
"After reading the reviews we selected to stay 5 nights.Wow, what a good choice. As a couple wanting privacy it was perfect, rooms were outstanding, only being surpassed by breakfast by the pool!The location as a brisk 15 minute walk to town was ideal as no need to get a taxi but far enough to escape thye noise.Professionally run, friendly to stay at, and ideally located - thanks Kouros -we will be back!",0
"Friends and I decided to splurge a little for our 2 nights in Mykonos, and Kouros made it totally worth it!! From the moment we stepped into the hotel van that picked us up from the ferry we felt like honored guests, even getting welcome wine and fruit! So nice!! And the views from our room - and the pool area were absolutely breathtaking. The staff was super helpful - including when we couldn't figure out how to unlock our room, and turn the shower on, they were there to help! The shuttle service to Mykonos town was also very nice. A shuttle to the beach was also very close by (maybe a 5 minute walk?) The only complaint I had was that the road leading to the hotel was very narrow, so a little nervewracking to walk, but that's Mykonos as an island, and no fault of the hotels! Overall, the room was huge, the beds were comfy, the views AMAZING and the experience was beyond anything we could've hoped for. I HIGHLY recommend this location to anyone traveling to Mykonos.   Room Tip: We had a view overlooking the pool and the ocean. Amazing! See more room tips",1
"A wonderful hotel the staff are lovely, the rooms are really modern with all the IT you need, the pool is perfect with a seat and table built into the pool to sit with a cool drink, breakfast was fantastic with so many staff buzzing around to help you, and there is also transport provided into town which is only a 15 min walk.One of my two choices of hotel each year that we go to Mykonos.",1
"The Kouros Hotel room (Junior Suite) was comfortable, private and offered spectacular balcony views of the Mykonos Ocean and Town. Sunrise and sunset from Kouros was very peaceful, quiet and beautiful because the hotel is positioned at one of the highest points nearest the town of Mykonos. Location of Kouros is superb not only because of the views but it is also within a 5 to 8 minute walk to the famous Mykonos Town and about 3 minutes to the Port of Mykonos. (if you decide to ferry to other Greek islands like Delos or Santorini).If this hotel got a bad rating from others it is more likely the guest that was the challenge, as I found the entire hotel staff (from the front desk staff, housekeeping staff, maintenance, dining staff, and hotel shuttle bus driver) very accommodating, friendly, and attentive. The buffet breakfast which was included in the stay was hands down the best breakfast buffet I have ever experienced at any hotel. The breakfast food options were many high quality and fresh, healthy, and very tasty. Every morning's breakfast was an incredible treat as we had fantastic food and friendly servers in the hotel dining area that overlooked the ocean.Kouros is also just the right size hotel whereby it is not too large by which you are just another guest or too small by which you don't have enough space. The location, accommodations, staff, and food are all excellent at a fair price.Without question and hesitation, I would return to Kouros and or refer any of my good friends to this hotel in Mykonos.",1
"From the moment we were met at the ferry it was luxury. The hotel is stunning, from the reception area to the pool to the rooms. Fantastic breakfast and restaurant. It's a bout a 10 minute walk into Myknos town but there is no way you would want to stay in town, the music goes on all night, even in the off season. It's lovely to wake in the morning to an amazing view.",0
"The room was big with air con downstairs. Bathroom was big with separate shower as well as over bath shower. Bath was whirlpool. Lots of free goodies and the bath products smell gorgeous. Slippers and bath robes included. Lovely to have a big sitting area to chill before heading out.Staff friendly and helpful, very professional. Breakfast really good.",0
"I do not know how people can rate this hotel so high.I stayed a few days in Hermes hotel ( and should have stayed there for the whole stay)- so much better hotel.Here is why I did not like it.the hotel uses the politically correct curvy energy efficient bulbs that puts you back into the stone age in regards to ability to see( not to mention to read something). You are better off with a candle.  the bed is very movable when 2 people sleep on it and has a slant, so I had back ache after sleeping there 2 nights. the front desk and the manager are adamant about not giving you free upgrade even at the end of the season when the hotel is more than half empty. ( we even verified the occupancy with the auxillary staff).the hotel is on a hill way far from town and despite the elevator there are some serious incline of stairs that are inevitable to be used at certain point of the visit since not everything is serviced by the elevator. the hotel leaves in your room red wine and fruit- nice touch if you drink , if you do not -it is not a nice touch.the staff was somewhat cold and briefthe good points was the shower, pool area,free transfer to town, breakfast buffet and the spa- those guys in the spa were terrific!!!I am glad that we stayed only 2 days - I would have a permanent back ache if we stayed longer. We had a prepaid reservation so if that was not the case we would have left on day 1. I will gladly though go back to Hermes Mykonos Hotel!!!! They are so much better.",1
"My husband and I stayed here on our 25th anniversary trip to Mykonos and Santorini. I booked the hotel based solely on photos and reviews from trip advisor and we were not disappointed! The staff was warm and welcoming and very helpful answering questions and offering recommendations. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a great view. Small touches like a welcoming bottle of wine and fruit basket made it extra special. Breakfast each day was delicious. More food and choices than anyone could ever ask for. walking distance to town, but shuttle would drop you off and pick you up in the evening so you didn't have to climb the hill back to the hotel.",0
"The staff, the room, and the facilities were all exceptional. The views were perfect from the room and from the pool The hotel location was an easy walk to Mykonos village. The breakfast buffet was exceptional. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",0
"Our early October stay at Kouros hotel was a short one but we were so blown away by the efficiency and quality of this hotel that we wish we had stayed longer. I travel very often because of my job and have stayed at many hotels around the world - this was one of the best!The hotel has an overall luxurious feeling but not in a flashy way. It's elegant and chic with clean white lines and a modern yet cycladic island-appropriate design/decor.First of all the staff: everyone we interacted with was extremely friendly and helpful without overdoing it or being fake as is often the case. We had everything we needed and much more. Before we even waived to one of the staff in the pool area they were with us to take our order. Reception staff also very helpful and courteous, asked us if we needed transfers, showed us the basics of Mykonos and the hotel.The room was beautiful, clean, big and airy, with a gorgeous terrace and view of the sea. Bathroom modern and sparkly clean with both tub and shower. Bed linen fresh and crisp and towels fluffy.Breakfast was fabulous - fresh fruit and juices, some traditional Greek options as well as cooked breakfast and everything freshly prepared and delicious!We were greeted with two complimentary drinks of our choice at the pool, were always brought towels for lounging as well as iced cold water and although these things might seem very obvious, many hotels fail to do them - even upscale ones.The staff in the pool area were ace!Whatever the owners/managers of this hotel are doing, they are doing a top-notch job. Everyone seems to be highly trained and knowledgeable, helpful and ready to offer the best service we have seen in years! They must really like their jobs!Everything down to the smallest details made a difference: the water and Greek candy waiting for us in our room, the turn down service with next day's weather forecast. Thank you for an unforgettable stay and there is no doubt that when we're back in Mykonos this is the place we'll come back to!",0
"Stayed in the hotel for a week, Staff is really nice, rooms are big,clean and well designed, every room has a gorgeous sea view, most amazing sunset view at the pool with fabulous Cocktails or little bottle of a delicous white wine, Food at the pool Restaurant was really good for lunch and dinner- Prices are more then fair (for mykonos), just ten minutes walk to the chora... definetly would stay there again! Thanks for an amazing holiday",0
"A most beautiful hotel, with modern Greek decor.The best breakfasts and gourmet restaurant.Stunning views from the balcony area, the pool,restaurant and from the bedroom out to the sea.The view is wide from the hills to the town.The ships sparkle.The town is an easy walk away and Kouros provided a drop off service each day.The beds were so comfortable. The staff are Ultra thoughtful, ever helpful and informative. We stayed 5 nights.",0
"Just got back from a lovely break in Mykonos and it was mainly down to the hotel and staff you always worry that you pick the right hotel, this was perfect the room was a dream very very clean. Staff could not do enough for you, without being in your face.breakfast was fantastic only problem so much choice (nice problem) only hotel that my wife was up before me so she could go down for breakfast.thanks Kouros hotel we will never forget sitting in our hot tub with a glass of wine, on our terrace watching the sunset,bliss   Room Tip: All rooms have terrace and sea view ,some with hot tubs See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful resort for 4 nights (wished it was 4 weeks)we stayed in a suite that had a Jacuzzi on our balcony.

"This hotel was such a good find. The staff were very attentive and took a real interest in the guests and the success of the hotel. On our arrival in Mykonos we were collected from the airport by the hotel driver who was also available to take guests to the beach parties and into town in the evenings and was happy to come and collect you with a quick phone call to the hotel. The hotel was only a short walk into town but some may struggle with its hilltop position.Breakfast at Kouros was great, lots of choice. There was a hotel restaurant although we didn't dine there. The room was stunning with a beautiful view of the agean sea, bottle of fizz and local sweets on arrival and a nightly turn down service leaving you a short message with the following days weather forecast were lovely touches. The hotel has a spa facility which we didn't use but offered a bad with beach towels you could take out with you. The pool was ample with snack served all day.Would definitely visit again . We stayed May 2014",0
"This is a lovely hotel located between the old and new ports in Mykonos.We stayed in a beautiful suite with a pool on the terrace (room 11) and received a complimentary bottle of Veuve upon arrival and 2 complimentary 1/2 hour spa treatments that unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to use.We didn't eat in the hotel, other than breakfast but all the food looked good and we did have some excellent cocktails by the pool. Breakfast itself was very tasty and included typical Greek fayre.The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the edge of the old town and a driver is available from 8pm until midnight to ferry you to and from town.The views from the suite were spectacular, especially at sunset.There was nothing to criticise (except perhaps a slighly colder than ideal pool) and all staff were very friendly.If you contact the hotel before your stay they will arrange for the driver to pick you up from the airport or port.",0
"We stayed at Kouros Hotel for our Honeymoon and we had the best welcome at our arrival! The reception and concierge made everything to have the perfect stay, always there to answer our questions or to make restaurant reservations with big smiles.The pool is great with a beautiful view and the breakfast is huge and delicious.We stayed in one of their Deluxe Suites with outdoor jacuzzi. Very romantic and the best sunset views. We recommend this hotel without hesitations!",0
"Beautiful hotel with stunning views from the balconies. The hotel is walking distance to Mykonos town center. I highly recommend renting an ATV if you're interested in traveling to the beaches, restaurants and nightlife outside of town. The hotel breakfast is fantastic. I also love the Korres products in the bathrooms. Overall, we had a great stay and will definitely stay here again.   Room Tip: sea view suite See more room tips",0
"We really enjoyed this hotel and would stay there again. The hotel is boutique and has a elegant and very upscale feel. The view from the hotel lobby, our room, and the pool is amazing. Our room had a private terrace, although I wish it had an umbrella as the the sun is intense. The staff was very gracious and friendly. However, we did figure out that Elena (assistant manager) was the best person to speak to for all questions, help and travel recommendations. She was lovely, smart, happy to help and made a difference in our trip. We liked the hotel so much that we wanted to try to stay another night and Elena contacted our other hotels in Santorini and Naxos to see if our dates could be moved. This clearly took some time as she had to repeatedly reach out to the other hotels, but she was happy to do so. Of every hotel we stayed at the service of this hotel was by far the best. Our room was clean, large, bright, and beachy. The hotel pool was quiet, clean, trendy/modern feel, with amazing views. They had a small bar at the pool and the wait staff was friendly. Also there is an elevator down to the pool which is idea for older guests. Breakfast was very good and the best of any of our hotels we stayed at. The hotel picked us up from the airport and was friendly and professional. The walk to town is roughly 15 mins on a narrow road. We walked it both during the day and at night. We felt very safe (two women traveling alone) walking home at night. The road is narrow, but still do'able even with wedge heels. However, for older guests (over 60-70 yrs of age) I would not suggest the walk at night. We did not eat dinner at the hotel and instead went into town every night. I would stay here again. I think the hotel is ideal for honeymooners, friends, and couples.",0
This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. The view from each room is stunning. This is one of the nicest hotels that we have stayed in and the staff was amazing. We will definitely stay at the Kouros Hotel and Suites if we are lucky enough to return to Mykonos again   Room Tip: All of the rooms have a fantastic view. See more room tips,0
Great service and pool!!! Great prices!Great locationReally good variety of rooms and food at rester aunt was fantastic!!!Pool food was also fantastic.Great views?Really good proximity to the beach and town. I would definitely stay here again in the future,0
"Hotel is beautiful - there were many attendants at the check-in desk when we arrived with the hotel shuttle from the ferry so there was no waiting upon check-in. I expressed that I hoped we had a really nice room since we had some issues with our room in Santorini. Initially, we were taken to a room where you had to walk up a large staircase to get to (probably 12 steps) - it had a balcony outside that looked onto another building (no view) - then the bell staff took us up another 12 step (or more) to our own private area that had a jacuzzi with 2 long couches that faced each other, not out at the water - I was not happy with this accommodation - all the steps, a balcony with no view and I didn't care about the jacuzzi - the bell staff called the front desk and we were taken to a different room - just 2 little stairs to get to, a balcony that looked onto beautiful yachts (no jacuzzi but that was okay since we weren't going to use anyway. The room is nicely decorated, on the smaller side, the bathroom nice - areas to put down all my toiletries which I always appreciate. The bed could be replaced too as the mattress is almost like a cot even though fortunately , we were able to get a good nite's sleep. The pool area is beautiful although my husband wished, like other travelers suggested, that the pretty white chairs could be adjusted to an upright position so you can read. The breakfast was very plentiful and delicious - food to please everyone and the same lovely view as our room, looking out onto the beautiful yachts. I found the service lacking in certain areas for a 'luxury' hotel such as this. First of all, one morning at breakfast, I asked for water from the waitstaff - I was told it was on the buffet - ok- I tried and asked another waitstaff for water and I got the same answer - really?? No one could bring me some water while they were bringing other guests coffee and tea? On a number of occasions we called the front desk and got no answer - I guess on the 'off times' there is only one or two attendants at the front desk and if they leave, there is no one there - seems like they need someone at all times to answer the phone. Our first evening there, we got a knock on the door around 6:30 from housekeeping staff asking if we wanted towels and turn-down service. Since we were getting ready I asked if she could come back in an hour - this attendant said 'no, she had 30 other rooms to attend to' - really? No??? I called the front desk and asked that we get turn down service and we did. From that point forward, I called the front desk to make sure we got our turn down service rather than deal with any impolite staff. Also, didn't care for the fact that a large laundry bag and cleaning supplies always seemed to be the resting place right outside our room. One evening we had a reservation at Hippie Fish restaurant - the hotel called a cab for us and because they are limited on the island, we had to wait a bit (fine) - the front desk attendant kept us informed on how long we had to wait for cab (not too long) - I asked the woman how much the cab should be - she replied to me that it wasn't a private taxi so we would be charged taxi rates - I was looking for more of an answer along the lines of 10 euros? 40 euros? some sort of guideline. Since this was a restaurant suggested to us by the hotel, she should have this information - my husband later told me he had asked the same question and got the same answer. On our final day since we had to be picked up before the 7:30 breakfast started, they offered to serve us breakfast in the lobby - I thought that was very nice. Great location as the hotel is at the end of the bus stop line - the bus is very clean and safe and runs on time - we took it several times into town. When we got off the ferry in Mykonos and was looking for our shuttle, the signage for this hotel is very small - it is on the bottom of the sign with another hotel more prominently featured on top of the sign - I would like to see better signage. Loved the mini-mart right next to the hotel - water is cheap and even had some nice souvenir items that were less expensive here than I saw at other places. Not withstanding the fact that service could be 'amped' up a bit, we had a very lovely time at this beautiful hotel.   Room Tip: Beautiful view of yachts from room 212 See more room tips",0
"This hotel is well situated within walking distance to many restaurants along the nearby beach. The pool area is fantastic and has great views. Rooms are basic but clean. Bed heads could be improved. We booked a number of rooms and we found that there was almost no difference between the standard room and the superior room. It certainly did not warrant an extra 100 euro per night. The superior room claims to have a spa like bathroom ,which actually just means a regular bath with jets. We preferred the rooms overlooking the main pool.",0
"Beautiful and clean rooms, tasty breakfasts overlooking the bay, polite and kind staff, especially at the front desk, 10 minute walk to Nammos Beach Club which is good for late lunch partying, go and have fun!The private beach accommodates about 30 beds and there are ladders to the water.The bay is filled with multi million dollar yatchs that dock at this wind protected inlet   Room Tip: Ask for bay view room See more room tips",0
"My wife and I were lucky enough to stay at Petasos hotel and spa in Mykonos for 5 days to end our Greek Islands holiday. A great location with amazing views of Psarou beach.The hotel was of a high standard with friendly and competent staff,scrumptious breakfasts and close to local restaurants for an evening out.The hotel's small private beach was perfect to have a quiet day in the sun away from the busy beaches.An inviting pool deck with lounges.The Spa treatments were excellent accompanied by a well equipped gym.The rooms were clean and adequately furnished. The only complaint was the mattress and pillows were a little hard for our liking and the shower was in the bathtub. But overall a great experience and would highly recommend.",0
"Great location, near the beach with EXCELLENT Views. The property is lovely with a spectacular pool area. We were very pleased. Service was excellent. Breakfast buffet was absolutely incredible. The room was good sized, very nice and clean. I would love to come back!! This place is so awesome.   Room Tip: We had a ground level room and enjoyed the view of the pool area and using the patio See more room tips",0
This must be my favorite hotel ever. Stunning views. Amazing service. The hotel it self is gorgeous with an amazing ambience. The restaurants are amazing with great food and service. The staff was so helpful and friendly. Loved everting about it. Can't wait to go back.,0
"The hotel was in a beautiful location. The pool, private beach and breakfast areas all overlooked the yachts anchored in the bay, what a magnificent setting. The swimming pool was salt water and very refreshing.The hotel staff were very friendly and gave great restaurant and beach recommendations. The rooms were average, but we didn't spend much time in the rooms.",0
"Where to start- the rooms are lovely and the pool area and setting are divine. They even have a private beach on the rocks and you can jump straight into the Med. The view from our room was spectacular,overlooking the Med with all the yachts moored. The location is protected from the wind which was great. The breakfast and pool menu was very good and well priced. The service was fantastic- very professional,knowledgeable and always with a smile. You can eat at the restaurants at Platys Gialos or spend time at that beach. The town is a 15min drive but the bus stop is right outside the hotel and buses run frequently and late into the night. A perfect stay!",1
"The property is very nice. We traveled as a family, so we had 3 rooms. Two rooms overlooked the pool area, and one room had a direct view over the ocean. All of the rooms were spacious and clean. The ocean view room was very nice, but for a 5 star hotel, I felt the furnishings could have been updated a bit. Also, another small glitch for our room was that the rooms below us had private pools and the guests below were young people who forgot they were staying in a hotel. So, we were unable to sit on our balcony to enjoy the beautiful views because all we could hear were screaming and splashing, etc below us.The pool area and adjacent bar area are very nice. However, the chaise lounges, although aesthetically pleasing, are not very comfortable- one cannot adjust head or feet up or down.Breakfast buffet was fantastic! A huge selection of food was offered and service was wonderful.All staff at the establishment were professional, helpful and friendly.",1
"Two couples, stayed for 3 nights. Location on the sea was perfect. Room 314 was spacious and very clean, well appointed. Sort of cool to have a pool on our terrace!Easy 15 minute bus ride to mykonos town, where we are every night.The only problem was that the pool was so pretty and comfortable that it was difficult to motivate the crew to explore.",0
"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days at the end of June with my husband and 2 kids aged 18 and 16. We have travelled extensively around the world and this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Firstly the location and views, particularly from the restaurant where breakfast is served every morning are incredible. It is also located right next to a main beach in Mykonos where we would meet up with other friends or have lunch every day. The busses to town and the markets were also right outside the hotel. The private beach in the hotel is just gorgeous and perfect for swimming and snorkelling and a great getaway from the crowds on the main beach. The staff and the service they gave were absolutely outstanding from the guy who picked us up from the ferry to the reception staff and waiters!. The breakfasts were outstanding and one could order just about anything you felt like! The pool area was stunning. The rooms were pretty average with no coffee or tea available but we spent so little time in them!! We booked a room with a private jacuzzi above it and that was also amazing and highly recommended! This was the start of our Greece trip and put us in the perfect mood for the rest of our travels. Our kids were so safe and had the time of their lives at the clubs and market places. We were one happy family and will definitely be back again and will only stay at the Petasos! I want to thank each and every staff member at the hotel for a great holiday.",1
"From the service to the location, this hotel was a wonderful entree to our first Greek island experience. Standard rooms are okay, we booked adjoining rooms as we have 2 pre-teens. Our first rooms were located on the ground floor and large, unfortunately due to noise issues from the room above, we requested to be moved which was done immediately thanks to the attentive staff at the front desk. Although our 2nd room (for my husband & I was smaller) - the children's room was large with a lovely sea-view, we opted to remain on the upper level. I would recommend 127 & 128 for standard rooms. The staff were incredibly helpful and Dora was just fantastic. Thank you also Michaelis (doubled as waiter & porter) for making our stay extra special. We would definitely recommend this hotel. The private beach and pool area has magnificent views and although the hotel was at full occupancy, there was always a sunbed available at either location.",1
"I cannot begin to explain how fantastic this hotel is. The location, aspect and service way exceeded our expectations. I want to thank Yiannis (Hotel manager) for his help when we had an accident, you went above and beyond to help us and this was greatly appreciated thank you!!We had a room with its own plunge pool, really worth the extra expense, although the hotel pool is spectacular but the service and constant attention from the staff and the willingness to help and make you feel comfortable really is what puts this hotel in a different class. The location is also outstanding near the main beach and nice restuarants. Thank you to everyone who made our stay an absolute joy!!   Room Tip: The sea views are spectacular See more room tips",0
"Hands down my favorite hotel in the world. I have stayed in many hotels in Europe and this is my favorite. The hotel is located at Psarou beach which is the best part part of Mykonos, it's a short walk from Nammos which is a really cool beach club.I have stayed here twice now and plan to come back every year until I need a hip replacement!!!Great atmosphere, great staff, great location and amenities.Highly recommend!!!",0
"We spent just two nights here at the end of our vacation of several countries. We were getting tired and Petasos ended up being the perfect place to relax and enjoy our visit to Mykonos.The hotel is modern. Everything is white with colors ascents which gave it a kind of beach elegance. The pool area and restaurants all face the sea and the many yachts and boats that anchor in the bay so it's hard to find a bad seat. The staff is amazing. Very attentive and friendly. Dora and Anastasia worked both the breakfast buffet and the pool side restaurant and even though we were only there for such a short time, remembered us, what we drank in the morning, and how long we were staying. You can tell from the pool area (were there is pool side service), to the restaurants, to the front desk women and bus boys that their goal is to make you happy and comfortable. They did it all with a genuine smile too. The hotel is nicely located near the beach with all the restaurants nearby. The bus that takes you into town literally stops across the street from the hotel. You have to have exact change for the bus but you can purchase tickets ahead of time at the hotel front desk and they provide you with the bus schedule as well. The breakfast Buffett was amazing and the best we encountered on our 3 week trip of Barcelona, Nice and Greece. Nice variety of everything. For instance a lot of places serve two or three types of fruit - usually melon. Petasos had different melons plus kiwi, grapes, etc. Items we just hadn't seen at other breakfast buffets.We did not upgrade our room here. The room was small but clean and nice and had a great view of the pool. However, we were on the ground floor behind the maids room so we did hear them. The room did have an odd set up for the sink and vanity. They were almost in the middle of the room as a divider of sorts. The mirror was long and vertical and rotated on a bar that went from the vanity to the ceiling. Pretty but not super practical as you could not have a light on around the vanity without the entire room getting light. So someone can't sleep well if someone else is trying to use the sink. Plus the hairdryer was inside a drawer which gave it limited range of use. Minor things when compared with the overall experience but something to know.Check out time was noon and our flight wasn't until 5:30 so the hotel gave us access to the beautiful spa to store some items and allowed us to shower before leaving. This allowed us to spend our last day relaxing by the pool. They stored our luggage for us as well. We really enjoyed our short stay and would return if in Mykonos again.",0
"This hotel is very clean and in a decent location. There is a SMALL private beach near the hotel, but a much larger public beach extremely close. Our room was clean and fixed up every day. The hotel staff was professional and helpful with recommendations for the island.",0
"Spent 5 nights here in July and had a fabulous time. The location is superb with Platy Gialos beach a very short walk and excellent views from the pool. Apart from the dire music from Nammos carrying as far as Petasos after 5pm each day, it's a superb corner of the island. Quite a large hotel with excellent breakfast, very good service, parking and spa. Highly recommend staying there.",0
"Recently stayed four nights here on our honeymoon. We had a great sea view room (187) that was centrally located in the hotel. The staff service was one of the highlights of the stay. They were very attentive and accommodating. The breakfast buffet had everything one would want. We hung out by the pool a couple of the days, and lounge chairs were always available. The chairs are not adjustable though. The location of the hotel was great. The public bus stops right outside the front door. You can buy tickets from the front desk, and it takes about 15 minutes before you're dropped off in the heart of Mykonos Town. Also, there are two beaches within walking distance with a ton of food options. Only small negative would be our room decor was dated. They have a pretty cheesy headboard in the bed, and there are window blinds in the shower. Also, the bed was a little firm for our liking.",1
"We were surprised how good this hotel is. Rooms are fantastic, we had 2 with a plunge pool that was massive and the 5 of us loved everything. Breakfast is amazing, staff are brilliant, in fact my wife and I said we haven't had service like it in a long time.We tried to find fault but couldn't we would return here tomorrow never been more relaxed and pampered. Well done to the management and staff you've been amazing.",1
It was a wonderful stay! The crew is awesome with no exceptions. They were very hospitable and friendly. The hotel is well located with buses passing by the door to bring us downtown. The bar the pool and all facilities are great. We totally recommend.,2
"We were fortunate to have a six night stay at Petasos Beach Hotel in Mykonos. This was our first visit to Mykonos and importantly Petasos.Our fantastic experience began with check in and the front desk staff were very welcoming. We took advantage of the hotel transfer from the airport which is only a 10 minute trip.Our room was fantastic and had great views of the sea. The quality of the room and cleanliness was of a high standard.All the hotel facilities such as the poolside bar, breakfast, sun lounges and private beach were exceptional.Importantly, all staff at the hotel were very friendly, helpful and made the trip a fantastic experience. There is a large number of staff available at all times so you will always have the opportunity to seek assistance if required.Breakfast was a great start to the day and the quality and variety of meals available was excellent.The hotel provides the option of spending time by the pool or the private beach.The hotel location at Platys Gialos meant that several restaurants were a short walk including bars and convenience stores. Importantly the bus stop to Mykonos town is located at the front door of Petasos Hotel.We also took advantage of walking to Paranga beach which was only 15 minute walk.Overall an exceptional high standard hotel with great staff. We will definitely stay at Petasos hotel when we next return to Mykonos.JohnSydney, Australia",1
"Petasos Beach Resort and Spa is ideally located in Platis Yialos (Platys Gialos) which is a relatively quiet port / shelter for yachts, sail boats and the hotel is nicely designed in Cyclades white and blue with a modern lobby filled with art deco furniture. While the reception was mediocre and almost snobbish, the service provided by the rest of the hotel staff was excellent. The food really good and we can vouch for it since we had breakfast, dinner, and lunch at the Club Restaurant, VIP Restaurant and Pool Bar respectively. We had 3 rooms - 308, 312 and 315. While all rooms had views of the sea, 308 overlooked the pool and I recommend taking the rooms in the wing where 312 and 315 are situated which overlooks the private villas and have a more open view of the sea and bay / cove.We loved the private beach cove below the Club Restaurant where we swam in the Aegean sea. We preferred this to the pool because we felt it was more private had less people and a wonderful view of the sea and beautiful boats which were moored next to the cove. The hotel is situated within walking distance to Nammos Restaurant - reputed to be the best restaurant in Mykonos and frequented by the well-heeled and jet set crowd. Make sure to book ahead of time.",2
"Spent 4 days and 3 nights at this resort in Mykonos with my family (6 of us in two rooms). Both rooms 188 and 157 were nice...188 had direct views of the ocean and 155 had a nice courtyard. For European standards, the room was large and well laid out (work area, Tv, decent sized bathroom and a separate toilet/shower area). The hotel is quite nice, clean and the pool is very nice (especially compared to the other two hotels we stayed at in the Greek Isles), the bar and restaurant are also nice. The front desk staff are friendly and try to be helpful when at all possible. The hotel is situated very near a nice public beach. They have a ""beach"" on the hotel but it is essentially shipped in sand on top of a rocky outcropping...it isn't terrible but I wouldn't really call it a beach. No worries though as the pool more than make up for it.I would have easily given this hotel 4 stars (maybe even 4.5 compared to other hotels in the price category in the Greek Isles) but unfortunately our room's (188) A/C unit was not working. Now I know that ""not working"" is a relative phrase and I debated this with the maintenance guy a few times. So for the owners that I hope read this...yes, the A/C was blowing out air that was cooler than the ambient temperature in the room but when the ambient temperature is probably 85 degrees or warmer...theoretically 80 degree air is cooler, no? My fear that our A/C was slowly dying was confirmed when my wife and I visited our daughter's room and the temperature was so cold that you could age meat in there! So despite my 2 requests to fix the A/C, the maintenance crew just kept telling my wife and I that ""it blows cold so your A/C is fine..."" I didn't feel like continuing the fight so we gave in (in retrospect I wouldn't have). We slept with the doors wide open and the bathroom window open to facilitate a cross breeze which made it bearable but seriously it was not comfortable. For a hotel to do so well on so many things and then let it fall apart on something as simple as maintenance is a pity.Given their attitude towards guest comfort I don't think I could recommend the hotel. If you do go, stay way way way clear of room 188!Cheers!   Room Tip: The upper floors with view of the bay are the best See more room tips",1
I stay also in Petasos beach hotel and spa every year for about 10 days. I love them for their kindness and their Hospitallity their location their breakfast their spa for the stuff. I will keep coming here every year also. By now I fell home !!!,2
"This hotel has everything you need in Mykonos.The basic rooms are very nice, with great views over the blue sea.The suites are amazing!The pool area is second to none, with unrivalled views of the coast.It is right next to Namos - a great place to eat and have a few drinks in the late afternoon.It's a short drive into town - if you hire quad bikes it's a great drive and there is parking available at the hotel.Service is exceptional.",0
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful with it's full white interior decor in the reception hall like walking straight into Heaven. The Staff are absolutely amazing every single young lady at the reception were so friendly and helpful. I have a severe latex allergy and the whole staff bent over backwards to make sure I would not be in contact with any latex , the cleaning of the room was especially done latex free and during breakfast the chef made special plates of whatever I requested latex free. We had a room overviewing the pool and sea and it was absolutely perfect the size was great bathroom big and spacious. The hotel is located at the bay of Platys Gialos where there is a huge option of restaurants. The bus stop to go to mykonos town is literally in front of the hotel 1,80euro per person for an 8 min drive. The spa treatments are to die for I had the aroma therapy massage was amazing. Thank you to everyone there !!!",1
"When you pull up to the front of this hotel, it doesn't look like much. But once you enter the modern, sleek white lobby you know you are in for a treat. It only gets better once you see the rooms and the pool area. Absolutely beautiful. We had booked 2 sea view rooms but they really did not have a sea view at all, were on the 1st floor, and faced a wall. But we were promptly transferred to rooms on the second floor that had the most amazing views out the balcony of the gorgeous pool deck and the magnificent sea beyond dotted with giant yachts. I could have sat there all day checking out the view. If you are booking rooms, I would make sure to book a pool/sea view to ensure you are in the central part of the hotel where the views are the best.Our rooms were spacious and the bathrooms were ample. We even had a large white couch to stretch out on. And the balcony views are unbelievable. The pool furniture is awesome--traditional chaise loungers as well as funky curved ones and couches and chairs with big comfy pillows. The views were fantastic. There's also a upper tanning deck with day beds to relax on. The pool is saltwater and was cold but it was refreshing! There's also a large jacuzzi. We also sat by the private beach, which is down a set of stairs from the pool and has about 15 loungers on a small spit of sand. There's a ladder you can launch yourself into the sea from but I wouldn't really call this a beach. The real beach (Platys Gialos) is a 3 minute walk from the hotel but our hotel was so much nicer than the public beach! The public bus stops right in front of the hotel and we used it every day to travel into Mykonos Town for shopping and restaurants (1.80 euros per person per ride--very good deal). The bus ride is 10-15 minutes. Very convenient.We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning with an unbelievable view of the sea. Very good choices and excellent food and service. We also had massages at the spa and they were very good, although there are no significant spa facilities to partake of (the pool was only to be used for specific treatments and the steam shower was broken--only the sauna was available for us). The best part was the front desk staff. Absolutely terrific. Gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations, maps, advice, ice buckets, bus tickets, whatever we needed. So friendly and accommodating. Made the stay even more special.Highly recommend this place and hope I can visit again someday.   Room Tip: Pool/sea view. Sea view alone does not ensure a view. See more room tips",2
Loved our stay in Mykonos. Our hotel was perfect. The rooms are new and clean. The views are fantastic. It's close to everything. Their breakfast buffet was incredible. The food was delicious. The staff so helpful and friendly. We didn't want to leave. Definitely a must if you go to Mykonos. We WILL be back! <U+2764><U+FE0F>,0
"The first room they took us to we were not pleased and they immediately took us to another room. The breakfast was wonderful, the hotel staff delightful and very helpful. The public bus stop was right in front of the hotel and took you right into Fabrica where Mykonos town is. From there we walked all around Mykonos Town, Little Venice and saw the Windmills. Also booked a tour to Delos from the Hotel.   Room Tip: Ask for Pool View - we had Sea View which we thought would be the best but it was not. See more room tips",0
"The resort is absolutely gorgeous! It is white and clean and beautifully decorated with all-white unique furniture and fixtures. We were upgraded to a room which offered a beautiful terrace overlooking the pool/ocean. When I first reserved this hotel, I was most excited about the infinity pools overlooking the sea. I was slightly disappointed when I arrived to find out that those infinity pools shown on the website are only in certain rooms and not available to hotel guests. This disappointment did not last long however, because the hotel pool area was still very beautiful and offered gorgeous views of the sea. There is also an outdoor hot tub which we enjoyed on the cooler evenings. We did not have dinner at their restaurant VIP, however we did have breakfast there every morning and it was delicious. Once again, the dining areas overlook the sea and there was a good selection of foods. The hotel has a small private ""beach"" area, which we only noticed was hotel's on the last days (the red cushions did not fit into the all white decor). This area is on the rock just over the sea, and has lovely chairs and stairs to enter the water. It was lovely. The hotel is very close to Platis Gialos which has many restaurants. The beach however has no space for you to lay out as it is completely taken over by beach chairs which you have to pay for to enjoy. The prices to our surprise for those beach chairs and umbrellas were reasonably priced at 15euros for 2 for the entire day (much cheaper than 20 euro per chair rates in the south of france). Many of the restaurants will not charge you a beach chair if you order food/drinks from their restaurant. Fortunately, if you do not want to pay for that, you can use the hotels private beach which was just as lovely. The airport is a quick 10 minute drive away, unfortunately the hotel does not offer a complimentary shuttle, they charge 19 euros round trip per person. The shuttle was large and comfortable. The service at the hotel was also very good. Directly outside of the hotel is a public bus that takes you to the town which was extremely convenient and inexpensive. The town is well worth a visit!! We also rented an ATV for the day for only 26euros a day, a great way to explore the island!! I would definitely stay here again and recommend this gorgeous property to my family and friends!!",0
"Seven adult family members stayed at this resort from May 30th to June 2, 2016. We loved every moment of our visit. The Petasos is very modern and well situated. The bus stop is right outside the front door and takes about 15 minutes into town. The resort is very clean and provided excellent customer service. Loved the view of the sea and pool and really enjoyed the private beach. I would highly recommend the Petasos. We loved every minute of our stay.",0
"Great Location just less than 10 minutes from the airport. It's located between 2 of the best beaches in Mykonos. Great view, warm welcome, small private beach, and very professional service and stuff, taking care of the smallest details.Going back in 2 weeks and recommended place for your stay in the island   Room Tip: go for a sea view room See more room tips",1
"This is truly fantastic hotel, incredible position,views, attention to detail and friendly attentive staff. Relaxed atmosphere andGreat service without being stuffy. Rooms are comfortable and the views and communal areas are incredible! What a gem! It's clean, fabulous breakfast and the view is hard to beat. Private beach or 50m walk down to main beach if you want the hussle and bustle. A few mins can ride into Mykonos itself. I can highly recommend the Petasos.",0
Very modern resort with all the amenities. Fabulous view of the ocean. Pool and beach. Staff is very customer focused. Bus stop right in front of resort that you can take into town. Several excellent restaurants and gift shops within very close walking distance.,0
"There is no hotel that hits the mark such as this one. The owner has clearly hit the pinnacle with his hotel delivering the ultimate hotel experience. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world, but this one beats every good previous amazing experience I have had. Honestly I thought I had walked onto the movie set of ""The Island"". The staff and service of this hotel was perfect. Lots of staff to help you. Perfect dining. Beautiful pools. The views are breathtaking. Everything is arranged for you. The perfect stay for fussy people. It's the type of hotel you would be happy to stay in and not bother going anywhere else. Didn't want to leave and will definitely return.",1
"The hotel was recommended by our tour operator. Everything was better than we could have hoped for. The staff were so courteous and the breakfast view across the bay was a joy in itself. The location away from the centre of Mykonos was no problem with a hotel courtesy bus for transfers and the public bus terminus outside the hotel.   Room Tip: Our room was South facing, overlooked the pool and the bay. See more room tips",0
"After moving from the Petasos Hotel due to the bad wifi and poor service, (I'd like to point out that we were only trying to book the remainder of our holiday, check emails and use Skype to make calls, which we were unable to do so as the room had no reception, simple connections that were not rectified when asked) However; the move across to the Beach Hotel was seem less and worth it. A gorgeous room with pool and beach views from personal balcony. A wonderful pool for relaxing and away from the bustle of Mykonos, but still very close to restaurants offering great specials and beach lounges. Wifi was a huge improvement. The staff were exceptional welcoming and warm. I spent 3hrs at the Nissaki (White Spa) I found very reasonable for the particular treatments.. The beautician was meticulous and thorougher. I absolutely enjoyed it.. 120€ covered Massage treatment 70mins, Pedicure with a 10minute foot massage as an extra, eye brow Shape and hair treatment.. Wish we had stayed alittle longer Mykonos is lovely as are the people :)",0
"We came to Petasos during our honeymoon trip to Greece. When we checked in (thankfully our room was ready prior to check in time) the sweet girls at the front desk explained the resort to us, as well as Mykynos. So unexpected and helpful. The room was nice, the view was breathtaking (superior room). It was lovely having an in suite steam room. The pool and private beach area was incredible. Drinks at the pool were good, but the service at the pool was better! The server even brought me an extra towel to use as my pillow! Breakfast each morning was good. They had a great spread that changed each day. The service was great, the view was spectacular. The girls will make sure you never run out of coffee! I spilled red medicine in my suitcase, the laundry department was able to get it out of my clothes in a few hours. For that, I am so grateful. Again, the girls at the front desk were so nice and helpful. One even ordered to go food for us! We were so surprised with a complimentary bottle of wine and a fruit basket to celebrate our honeymoon. All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating. One maid knocked on our door each afternoon asking if we needed fresh towels. She also straightened up little things in our room, like our books and sunscreen. Typing this makes me want to go back! Great resort!",0
"Soooo gooood, The staff is like family , try the restaurant too ! Small privat beach. Only 10 min from City by taxi or bus. Stunning views, good beds, very clean, after visiting other beaches it's always coming home in the evening, great interieurs, price- quality totally OK, great Spa , Gay friendly ! Don't look further ! A to do ! x",0
"wonderful experience! very friendly and professional staff', beautiful sea view from the room , very comfortable bed, excellent breakfast , and great dinner!!!! nice location near the beach , tavernasDefinitely recommended hotel! ,",0
"This was my last stop on my whirlwind tour of Greece and it was the perfect place to just relax and enjoy the pool and ocean. The staff was very friendly and helped me with restaurant reccos, set up my tour for Delos Island and even helped me change my ferry ticket and transfers back to Athens.I did make use if the spa which was nice, the Thassonliki whirl pool was pretty cool and I had the best facial ever (believe it was the Aegean Algae). The only downside was the food. I had lunch by the pool and the menu options were extremely weird, white chocolate and chicken salad??? And the breakfast buffet was just okay and not very fresh. Definitely eat offsite.",1
"Excellent rooms, beautiful lobby, very professional and extremely friendly staff, brilliant views from the rooms, from the pool and from the restaurant, great breakfast, wouldn't change a thing! Definitely going back!",0
"I loved everything about the Petasos Beach Hotel and Spa. The view was amazing, the rooms were perfect, the staff was incredible friendly and the breakfast was great. The location was great too, close to a few nice restaurants and a short, easy bus ride into Mykonos town.",0
"If you are from the US it will make sense to you if I say the rooms at this hotel is around the level of a Holiday Inn. The only thing 5 star (and we know what 5 star should be as we frequent the Four Seasons chain which often times truly is 5 star) about this hotel are the pictures. The bed sheets are thin and not high count, the rooms are small (we had a standard triple) and though it can fit two adults and a small child, there really is not much space outside of the beds that pretty much make up the whole room. I think the sofa was turned into a little twin bed for our kid and it worked out fine only after the first night, he woke up with 4 round bites on his face. The next day he had some bites on his hands. We were trying to figure out what they were and his doctor confirmed they were bed bugs. There is nothing 5 star about bed bugs. A hotel will always try to deny the existence of bedbugs, but from our end due to the fact that this hotel was one of the first places visited and the timing at which the bites happened, makes it very easy to connect this to the hotel. Beyond this problem, I would like to note the bathroom in particular was a huge pain for us. There is a stand up shower w a short shower curtain which doesn't hold any water in. The shower is also next to the toilet and everytime anyone takes a shower the whole bathroom floods, which can make it somewhat unpleasant for the next person coming in. I guess there is a drain in the bathroom so perhaps water is meant to escape, but it is still unpleasant none the less. The other choice is a bathtub with no shower curtain. You can take your pick of either a water flooded toilet area or a water flooded sink area. My choice for a 5-star hotel would be neither. I would also like to note that we were there early May (first week) which is still off peak and the hotel was virtually empty. The island as a whole was pretty empty as a matter of fact as I guess this is normal for this period. The lack of people, however, didn't exempt us from getting complaints apparently from the other two guests of the hotel for being too loud at night (10-11pm). Considering we were told that dinner in Greece started at like 9pm and Mykonos is known for late night partying, we were surprised that we were warned for being loud, and especially because no one was partying, screaming, or banging on walls in our room. It was for our two year old talking loudly and us sometimes having to sternly discipline him at times, so my guess is that the walls are pretty thin there too. A bit of insight on the staff, three main women at the front desk during daytime hours (one is friendly and two are not so much) and one guy who doesn't speak much English at night. Of course this is likely to change during peak times on the island. Bell boy, nice and friendly. Breakfast, decent and one very nice server. Way way too cold to go into the water, pool or ocean for the dates we were there. Heated Jacuzzi, not that warm. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for luxury.   Room Tip: Standard rooms aren't so great. See more room tips",4
"Lovely stay that met and exceeded expectations. The views all over this island are pretty amazing however the accommodations of this place make it an excellent choice. Upon arrival and throughout the stay, the reception has been friendly, helpful, professional and knowledgeable. It is clear that each staff member has the common goal of making your stay a positive experience. The rooms are delightful and offer a lovely balcony and again, there is not a bad view in Mykonos. The bathrooms provide shower or bath option. The pool area is beautiful and the fitness center has a decent assortment of exercise equipment. The breakfast food buffet had a nice variety to offer and again, the staff was there making sure all needs met while overlooking amazing Mykonos views. The bus stop to get into town is located literally right outside the hotel entrance; this is an easy and affordable way to get around to island hot spots.",0
"Beautiful surroundings and large pool area. Very conveniently located with a private beach and great ocean view. Very helpful staff. Good food. We stayed two nights in this great resort. We were four couples from Moradabad, India. The day we checked-in to the hotel was the first day of May when the resort reopened for summer season. The hotel area/grounds were very clean. Spa was great. .   Room Tip: Rooms on ground floor facing the pools are the preferred. See more room tips",0
This was our last stop on our greece vacation and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel. This resort has literally everything you need. There is a private beach area around the corner and a hotel staff that is second to none. The rooms are good size and always clean. We had breakfast also included in our hotel stay which was definitely worth the time. There were ATVs nearby and buses just outside the hotel to travel into town. Would definitely stay here again,1
"We were blown away by this beautiful hotel ! Our hostess then surprised us with an upgrade with a private pool , gym and beach. Behind us were 100 plus foot yachts tied to the rocks behind our villa . Our family of five could walk our private path ten steps from our pool to the outside dining area overlooking the harbor. The main pool and outdoor lounge were off the chart. As well we were in walking distance of water taxi and great restaurants. We would definitely go back !",0
"I actually stayed here in July 2010, it was the most memorable hotel while on my European holiday with my sister. Short stroll down the road was the beach with a few restaurants, near by was a small store for food ect. Right outside the hotel the bus could pick you up to take you to the main town which was about 20 mins. The pool area is over looking the Mediterranean Sea.",0
"We have stayed at Petasos Beach Hotel several times. It is a great hotel in an excellent location. The views are wonderful, the bus stop is directly in front of the hotel, the breakfast is excellent, and staff is very friendly. You can visit Platy Gialos beach right down the street, catch the ferry to all the other popular beaches just a few steps from the hotel, or, if you want some exercise, you can walk to Paraga and Paradise Beaches. Psarou Beach is also nearby, as are several good restaurants.   Room Tip: Get a room with a view of the bay below. See more room tips",0
"The most gorgeous view I have ever seen. Nice rooms- good size, really pretty views. Very clean when it came to room service. I actually loved the products they gave for shampoo/conditioner when usually I never use hotels. At night they have this roof top area that my hubby and I would just go lay and just gaze at the unreal view! Food- breakfast was amazing. They had everything that you would want. Everything so fresh. Did not eat dinner there, but heard good things about it. The staff was so sweet and attended to everything. Loved the location bc the bus stop was literally RIGHT in front of the hotel so it was very convenient!! Has its own little beach but also very close to the beach with the taxi fairy that took you to any beach you wanted! Awesome location, a dream come true!",2
"i took my two teenagers 12 and 14 yrs and husband to Mykonos last year and stayed in this hotel which i found on the internet. It was fantastic ! The location is excellent as it is between the two best beaches nammos and platis giallos ... it is also a 2 min walk to the little taxi boats that stop at all the beaches and 1 min from the bus that drips you in to mykonos town ! what more could you ask for? The staff are 5 star , very professional and helpful offering all types of advice and help if needed.Everyone loved it and would definately go back",2
"I have never stayed at a hotel with such an amazing view of the ocean. Besides the location, the property itself was gorgeous. The service was impeccable! From the front desk to the wait staff at the pool, everyone was friendly and accommodating. Petasos Beach hotel made our vacation one of the best experiences ever!   Room Tip: Specifically ask for a room with ocean view . . . you won't be disappointed. See more room tips",0
"We had our honeymoon there it was such a great time!!!! The service, stuff, and everything was amazing.. More over the view was incredible!! The breakfast was room serviced and looks and taste so delicious.. The jacuzzi was great!! But the pool was soo cool.. We really felt relaxed and enjoyed our stay there to the maximum!! I Miss that place!!",0
The beauty of this resort cannot be understated. Our room had a lovely view of the sea and was comfortable and modern. The grounds and facilities showed great care and attention to detail. The furniture throughout was modern and fun. The restaurants offered enjoyable meals. A lovely stay and within a short walk to additional restaurants and shops.   Room Tip: We were happy with the room that we were given. Water views are a must! See more room tips,0
Pretty much everything was excellent. Liked the restaurant and pool area by the waterfront with all the luxury yachts in bay. Breakfast was ok but the staff was the best I experienced in Greece. The hotel also had a small private beach which was a very nice alternative to the pool. Transportation to Mykonos city was quick (15 min) and the bus stopped just outside the hotel entrance.,1
"I did not stay at this hotel, but I did have a ""spa day"" at the spa and it was excellent! I did a session in the thelassotherapy pool which was amazing. You get the pool to yourself, and it is saltwater, heated to body temperature. And you float around to the various water jets that massage different parts of your body, like lower back, feet, shoulders, etc. It was amazing! Then I also had a foot and leg massage, and a manicure. The facilities are really pretty, and the staff was lovely. I recommend the spa very much. Loved it!",0
"Stunning hotel... Not too big and not too small. We stayed here in 2013 and again 2015 in July for 9 days with our 3 children youngest aged 9. This is a very welcoming hotel for families. The staff here are amazing and just go out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable. Breakfasts are bliss over looking the bay. One thing that could be improved is the gym. Need to update the treadmills. There was only one working when I was there and weight equipment was broken, apart from that everything was fantastic. I will definitely be coming back and we cant wait !! Thanks Petasos..   Room Tip: Seaview rooms See more room tips",1
"Seriously perfect hotel! We visited Mykonos in October 2015 - celebrating our anniversary. When we arrived at the airport we were greeted by our driver. Upon arriving at Petasos the first thing I noticed was how beautiful everything was. The reception was beyond amazing and they upgraded us to a shared pool room! Unbelievable experience! Everything about this resort was incredible - the maid service, staff, pools - all great!The resort is a short walk to the restaurants and beaches. It is also far enough away from Mykonos town (which is a whole other experience in itself). Highly recommend this resort!",0
read lots of reviews all positive so decided to go ahead and book the Petasos Hotel and I am so glad I did as it really made our first trip to Mykonos amazing. The location in Platos Gialos is perfect and the regular taxi boat to service to the other beaches is ideal if you like trying out new beaches every day. First day we arrived had a booking for lunch at Nammos which is walking distance and loved the atmosphere and the vibe. Fantastic Lunch. After that it was a mixture of going to the different beaches at paradise and Super Paradise for Fun in the Sun. Every evening it was trip into town using the local bus which is perfect way to travel. Went to Hakassan and Remezzo both amazing places for Fine dining. Lots of nice small places to eat so we just wandered around and took out pick. Finally the best part was a trip to Delos island a must if you come to Mykonos. Lots of history and culture to soak in. Went with my wife and daughter who also loved it. Will g bck next summer.,0
"I was at the tail end of a 2 week tour of Greece and spent the last three days at this resort. The property is nestled on the hillside a few 100 yards from the beach. The overall property is beautiful and well maintained. The rooms are well appointed and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly, helpful and very patient. Excellent morning breakfast buffet. I did have a massage at the spa and it was heaven. I would mention, for those with any mobility problems, there are steps to climb and the property has many levels. I highly recommend this resort!",0
"This Resort is really beautiful with private beach.Service is also very good.There are lots of beaches close by.If you are really adventurous ,I would recommend you to walk from here to Paradise beach.The hike is so beautiful with amazing views",1
"Beautiful rooms, great service, amazing local restaurants, recommend Yailo yailo, great walk through hillside trails to several other beach resorts. Quiet, peaceful, fun staff especially at pool bar, helpful and knowledgeable. Go end of September to avoid party Island life July and August.",1
"Spent three days here in September. The resort is fantastic with a beautiful swimming pool, waterside dining and really friendly staff. We were upgraded to a room with its own rooftop sundeck and jacuzzi - you can't get much better than that! It's a way out of town, but the local bus leaves regularly from right outside the resort and costs next to nothing and it all works well. Loved every minute at this place and would recommend it to anyone going to Mykonos.",0
The hotel is located in Platys Gialos and is amazing! From the moment you arrive to the time you enter your room everything was more beautiful then the next! Arriving to this beautiful hotel you walk up the stairs into a gorgeous lobby! The service went out of their way to help you with any needs! We were celebrating our anniversary and were upgraded to a great room overlooking the ocean and pool. We received a complimentary bottle of wine as well which was a great touch we appreciated! The rooms are very nice and accommodating. The pool area is amazing with the views and lounging areas! In the evening loved how the colors changed and illuminated. Walking distance to Platys Gialos beach with had a great selection of places to get some beach chairs and umbrella while staff wait on you all day. The hotel also has a great private beach as well to enjoy. You can grab the local bus to get very easy into town. The morning breakfast was wonderful... fresh juices and the best greek yogurt! A beautiful stay!!!!,0
"Excellent hotel. Great location, clean; friendly and helpful staff. Amazing view from our second floor balcony overlooking the pool and sea; outstanding European style breakfast overlooking the ocean with an abundance of choices and excellent service. Would absolutely return to this hotel",0
Had a great time. Room was clean. Bed could have been a wee bit more comfortable. Sheets are kind of rough. Fabric softener would do wonders. Excellent view of the popular beach. Warm during the day and cool and breezy at night in October. 24 hour room service. Twice daily cleaning. Down comforter and pillows. Steam shower and jacuzzi bath. Nice toiletries that area abundant and replenished all day. Excellent service. Would highly recommended for couples.,1
"There are not enough nor adequate superlatives to convey just how beautiful, relaxing, and luxurious this hotel is! Room 171 offers a perfect view of not only the pool and lounge chairs area, but of The Agean Sea as well! The waterfall offered the most relaxing ambience one could hope for, and we had to force ourselves to leave the hotel to go up into town. (Which, by the way, was extremely simple; the bus stop is right across the street and busses run every 30 minutes!) Very friendly and knowledgeable staff always on hand to answer questions and offer suggestions when asked. Breakfast is the best, hands-down, the BEST, anywhere on Earth! Words just don't do justice to this beautiful slice of heaven!   Room Tip: We LOVED Room 171. Right by a waterfall overlooking the pool area, and an amazing view of the Agean! See more room tips",0
"We stayed here again for 4 nights in early September this year and it is still as great as we remembered from our last visit 4 years ago. The lovely reception staff gave us an upgrade to a spa suite - very nice! And a bottle of wine and bowl of lovely fresh fruit went down well too. We had a swim at the new ""beach area"" which was fine- they have their own ""lifeguard"" watching over the swimmers which is a good safety feature. Just love the view over the beach and cove from the restaurant - best way to enjoy their extensive breakfast buffet. The hotel is located very close to Platys Gialos beach and restaurants and the reception staff can sell you the bus tickets to get you into Mykonos town - the bus stop is in front of the hotel - very cheap and only a short trip. You can also catch a ferry within 200 metres of the hotel entrance that hops along the beaches along the coast e.g Paradise, Super Paradise etc. The reception staff were also very helpful with booking us a Delos Island tour too. The rooms decor is still fresh looking and nothing lacking in amenities. Hope we get to return here again in a few years time!   Room Tip: Rooms had an outdoor spa, Umbrella, sofa and beach lounges with views over the bay above the room it... See more room tips",0
"We stayed at the Petasos Beach Hotel & Spa recently and we never wanted to leave! First, upon registration...they take all the time you need in recommending restaurants and things to do while you are on the island. But we found out quickly...we didn't want to leave the hotel! We stayed in room 308. Great views of the Aegean! The room was so spacious and modern! The dinner we had at the restaurant was one of the best we've ever had! They offered all sorts of delicious complimentary tastes as well. Everything was just amazing!!! The outside deck had beds you could relax on or you could lounge near the pool. Just glorious. One excursion we did take was a sunset catamaran cruise with Captain Michael. The hotel booked this for us...but if it's busy in season...you should book ahead yourself by going to MykonosCatamaran.com. The crew made dinner for us...and it was the ""next best"" meal we enjoyed on our trip of the Greek Islands. It's inexpensive to take the bus into town which we did a few times. Do NOT eat at the Sea Satin Market! They wanted $130 euros for a one pound lobster. In fact, sea food is really not all that great...even on Santorini and Crete. We did take a ferry to Santorini...which is great...but you need to get your tickets in advance as the ticket office is a ways from the place where the ferry departs from. The rest of our trip we flew Aegean Airlines to Santorini and Crete...a wonderful airline!!!   Room Tip: Room 308 had a wonderful balcony and view of the Aegean. See more room tips",1
the location of this hotel is perfect walking distance to the beach. the staff is really amazing. food was outstanding. it is a bit pricey but i think worth it. seems small but they have over a 140 rooms. the pool area has a stunning view.,0
"Just spent a week here with my daughter and I totally agree with all the excellent reviews. The view from the breakfast/dining room is breathtaking and the breakfast buffet was excellent with an enormous variety of choice, plus a daily special. I should like to mention specifically Penelope who remembered our order from day 1 and brought us fresh figs and mango every day. Nothing is too much trouble for the entire staff. We indulged in the spa and it was worth the money. Would like to particularly mention Marina who gave me a wonderful massage, also Chara and Louisa plus Kelly who did an excellent pedicure.The pool area is great and we loved the roof area with the huge beds. The pool is salt water and never crowded. The bus goes from outside the hotel every 30 mins and costs 3.2 euros return to town plus you can buy your ticket at the reception. It runs until 02.30. We walked into town one day and it took 40 mins.We stayed in the Roof Top Villa no 428 which had a huge totally private seaview terrace and 2 bedrooms. Wifi on arrival was a bit hit and miss but after we complained they give us access to the private network which worked perfectly. They even gave me a Nespresso machine to use for my wake-up shot!This is the sister hotel to the Mykonos Grand where we stayed last year and we want to return to both very soon.

"From the moment we arrived it was clear the staff has been well trained in many languages and great manners. Each and every staff member from the reception area, housekeeping, luggage, restaurant, pool restaurant, to the beautiful SPA has been selected and trained to really care for their guests.The facilities are beyond beautiful from the view of the water to the quality care of the grounds.The breakfast is part of the package... THE BEST in every way..coffee selections, food choices, and of course the views.The city bus runs outside the main hotel door and goes to the heart of Mykonos. YOU will not be disappointed with this selection.   Room Tip: Just ask when you make your reservation for a room with a view in the price range you want... See more room tips",1
"had one night here whilst in Mykonos. the rooms, especially the sea view rooms are very special..... the staff are very helpful and friendly.... very trendy hotel and great views from the restaurant and pools. has its own private beach. will definitely go back if i can afford to. great for couples, wouldn't suggest for kids.   Room Tip: 316, perfect. See more room tips",0
"We met up with friends here on the last days of their honeymoon. The location is ideal as you can walk down to the beach or catch a bus into Mykonos main which stops right outside the hotel every 30minsWe paid for a deluxe room which was fantastic- great beach views, lovely big bath and bathroom and spacious room with a couch and coffee table. Our friends got a superior room and it was not nearly as nice, much much smaller so I recommend paying the extra.The pool was salt water which was fantastic and at night looked awesome.The cocktails were well priced but I have to say the food at the restaurant and pool was ok but nothing to get excited over.Wifi was a bit hit and miss but still overall had an awesome time and would definitely go back",0
"My husband and I spent part of our honeymoon at Petasos. The view was beautiful and the breakfast offered in the morning was amazing. We booked a couples spa service and had a great experience. There is a clean pool and beach access that is not over crowded. To swim in the ocean you need to climb across some rocks which can be a little tricky. There is sand beach access down the road, but it tends to get crowded and a little pricey to rent chairs and umbrellas. As honeymooners, we were a little overwhelmed with the amount of children staying at the hotel. The pool area tended to be loud with a lot of children. We never even got to use the hot tub because there always seemed to be children using it as a kiddy pool. As a family hotel I would absolutely recommend, but as a honeymoon hotel I would keep looking!",1
"The Hotel is perfectly located with stunning views, close to the beach with plenty of restaurants close by, even-though the best restaurant is at the Hotel.From the moment you walk in you are greeted by friendly and professional staff, from the porters, waiters and cleaners to the hard working restaurant manageress and reception staff. Special mention to Asimina at the front desk who was always friendly and professional, greeted us by the name and knew our itinerary. The rooms are basic, but along with the hotel grounds well maintained. The spa facilities are stunning and as the rest of the Hotel, staff are very friendly and professional.We stayed as a family for just over a week, but I think this is a perfect Honeymoon location.The only issue we experienced was poor WIFI signal and annoying log in procedures, especially in the rooms.",0
"This is a very nice hotel just a few steps from Gialos Beach -very convenient. The staff was very helpful, no matter what we asked. Upon our arrival, the sea view room we booked was not available, so they upgraded us to a room that had a private rooftop patio with sea view and jacuzzi at no extra charge. The jacuzzi was a great way to relax after a day of walking around town. We are at the VIP restaurant in the hotel the night of our arrival. It was a bit expensive, but the food and wine was very good. This restaurant is unusual in that it specializes in sushi and French cuisine. Breakfast buffet is served in the same dining space, and it had everything we could ask for except made-to-order omelets. The pool and bar area is beautiful and well-appointed. Our stay was too short to take advantage of the spa, but if we ever return to Mykonos, we will definitely return to Petasos Beach Hotel and Spa.",1
"This hotel has wonderful facilities - the pool, breakfast restaurant and spa were fantastic. It's also in a wonderful location with its own private beach and Nammos Beach club just around the corner (a must for lunch or afternoon drinks). The down side is the rooms, we spent $730 AUD per night and our room was simple and unremarkable. Try to get a sea view at least. Overall I would recommend this hotel.",0
"We stayed at the Mykonos Bay Hotel in August 2016 and were really happy. We were picked up at the airport by Mr Nikos, the owner of the hotel who is a really lovely guy. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely staff all of who were exceptionally friendly providing a warm and welcoming atmosphere from breakfast in the morning to evening drinks before dinner. It feels like there is a genuinely nice team behind the operation making it very pleasant to stay at. The hotel is well situated only 10 minutes walking distance from the famous Mykonos windmills and Caprice and Little Venice, has a salt water pool and a really beautiful view on the sea. We had a partial sea view room. Breakfast is delicious and has a fairly rich menu to chose from. Some highlights of the impeccable service included the hotel's transport to various locations, assistance with rental car and even picking up our ferry tickets to Santorini. Most of all, however, they went out their way to find a Myconian vegetable my girlfriend had liked on her salad at a restaurant, found it and gave us a big bag of it free of charge. Really a great time at Mykonos Bay Hotel and highly recommend it for couples, but also groups of friends and families. We will go back for sure!",0
"We arrived to the mostly lovely welcome and the staff remained great throughout our visit! First thing we did was grab lunch at the poolside restaurant. What a view! The food & wine were delicious. Sitting at the pool looking to the beach is amazing. Our room was spacious. There was a hot tub inside the room, which is odd but we did use it. We also had a large deck facing the water with chaise lounge chairs and a set of chairs with a table. It was nice to read on or do a little morning exercise. The hotel is a short walk into town and away from the craziness of town. We walked into town multiple times a day during our stay. The bus to the boat ferry was very nice as well. Had a wonderful experience in Mykonos and our hotel stay was perfect!",0
"Brill staff, brill beach, brill pool, brill food, what can I say, I cannot fault this place...apart from...wardrobe space needs room for maxi/long dresses & we had a room that slept 3 & single bed could have a new mattress.   Room Tip: All rooms are pretty much the same. See more room tips",0
"We chose this hotel for our honeymoon. We were a bit nervous when we told locals in Santorini, Greece that we were going to Mykonos, Greece next during our trip as they kept saying it was very loud and quite the party island. However, this hotel was the perfect option if you are looking for something peaceful and romantic! It was far enough away from the loud party scene that Mykonos is known for. Being right on the beach was fantastic! If you are a guest of the hotel they provide free beach towels and chairs. The pool was also beautiful. The hotel room was adequate but not great. The bathroom was very small. The actual room was fine. We didn't mind too much though because we spent a lot of our time at the pool/beach.   Room Tip: Great views, quiet area, okay room See more room tips",0
"Absolutely breathtaking!!! Upon arrival, we were greeted with a welcome drink for the family. The staff was exceptional. The service was exceptional. The room was amazing. Very clean. We will definitely go back!!   Room Tip: all beautiful! See more room tips",0
My family stayed for a few nights in this hotel and had such a great experience with the hotel! The views from our rooms were absolutely beautiful and we were immediately welcomed by friendly and helpful staff members (as well as with a glass of the hotels homemade lemonade which was delicious). We spend a decent amount of time at the pool where the staff (especially Thanos and Jouliano) were friendly and very helpful!,0
"Only good emotions about our stay in this property. Very close to the center of Mykonos, convenient and so nice views. Staff is excellent and very caring of the people staying in the hotel. We enjoyed every minute and we totally recommend to everyone that wants to experience the Greek hospitality. Personalized services to each guest in order to achieve their expectations! Breakfast, pool area, facilities, design, excellent atmosphere and people that makes us want to come back every year. Special special thanks to Panos for his help and his kindness, we are very happy to meet him in this modern hotel.<U+2600><U+FE0F><U+2600><U+FE0F><U+2600><U+FE0F>",0
"I love Mykonos Bay Hotel and I come here every year to stay. (it has been my 8th year this summer). The rooms are very nice and clean with a minimal decor. The location is great as its just less than 10 minutes walk right to the centre of the town. The amenities are great, with a nice pool and great breakfast. And the last but not the least the hotel staff are amazing, i feel really at home there.",0
"Great hotel, well located 5 min walking from all the action. Stayed there 2 nights. Very clean and great decoration. The staff is very helpful and kind. They picked up us for free at the airport and they also arranged renting a car for us. We had an amazing stay and definitely we recommend the hotel. Free wifi, breakfast buffet, hotel has its own pool and beach",0
"The best supportive and polite hotel crew I've ever seen. Especially Mr. Paros was always helpful and supportive about every kind of our demand. Beside its staff, convenient location, comfortable and clean rooms and tasty foods were worth to visit again...",0
"We had a fantastic time in Mykonos... The hotel was great, and it is close to town. It was clean and uniquely stylish. The pool area is totally fabulous. There's a fab private beach; but the most enchanting part of it all was the staff. Like, they're totally fab - especially Tzouliano & Thanos...WE WILL DEFINITELY COME AGAIN!!!",0
"Just returned after week at Mykonos Bay. Lovely hotel, beautiful location, good food,very clean but best of all the staff were, without exception, excellent. If we return to Mykonos in the future we won't be staying anywhere else.",0
"This is a lovely boutique hotel very close to Mykonos town , which is a good thing in Mykonos as there are only 40 official taxis in the town ! .It has a beach , very relaxed and away from the busy life of the town . The perfect place to spend a few days in Mykonos . We have had an awesome time here and lovely the staff who are very helpful and personal .",0
We stayed here for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. The best part of being at this hotel was the fact that it is walking distance to downtown (Mykonos Town). The hotel is also a great location on the beach and with a beautiful pool.,0
"Mykonos Bay Hotel was perfect! From the moment we were picked up from the airport, to the moment we were dropped to the port (all transfers were complimentary) I could not fault the impeccable service and warm, friendly nature of the staff. My favourite parts of my stay here were the welcome drink, the close proximity to the town (5 minute walk max - very easy), the beautiful pool/lounge area and the buffet breakfast. The staff were so friendly and seemed genuinely happy to help us make the most of our stay in Mykonos. Clean, close and comfortable, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else. We highly recommend. Stayed as a couple in the Courtyard View room.",2
"We stayed for 4 days and everything about this hotel was just amazing! The room was beautiful, very stylish and clean. And the pool was great, not to mention their sunbed-pillows which were beyond comfortable. But I must say one of the best parts of our visit was the friendly staff, especially Juliano and Thanos who was always so friendly and helpful with everything. Could not ask for a better hotel, we’ll be back again!",1
"This is the third time I have stayed at Mykonos Bay Hotel. Reasons? Location, rooms, facilities, cleanliness, view, pool, bar/restaurant ... yes, all of these, but the best feature is the staff ... friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, helpful ... One big family ... brothers, sisters, and a father. And the cocktails ... These are all Anna's secrets.",2
"Hotel is practically at sandy shore, so the sea is only a few steps away.The rooms are spacious, stylish and clean.Breakfast buffet with a huge selection - all delicious and fresh.Water in swimming pool was could in June.Short walk from the city center.",1
"Could not fault this hotel in anyway in fact I actually can not wait to go back this time next year... The staff Truly amazing so friendly and extremely helpful and kind.... My future brother in law actually proposed to my sister on this trip and the owner personally took him into the town to find the ""perfect ring"" now I dont know off or think that any other hotel owners would be this kind or helpful... all the staff were genuinely excited to discover if she said 'yes"" and of course she did.... Personal thank you to Dimitris the hotel manager he was just the best... always wanting us to have a great day and saw to our every need ( and we are a demanding bunch of guests !!)The HotelJust stunning beautiful decor and interiors and attention to detail even down to the cushions in the courtyard...stayed in room 33 fab room with the best view of the ocean especially whilst in the hot tub .. everything very clean and just so prettygreat food and the staff around the pool were wonderful..Location Great only five mins walk into the town and the beach was beautiful..   Room Tip: no 33 hot tub on the balcony and perfect view of the pool beach and the sea See more room tips",1
"Stayed for one week at end of June and had a lovely time at Mykonos Bay. From the airport pick up to the friendly welcome drink and information it is true that the staff make you feel extremely welcome and relaxed from the minute you arrive to the moment you leave. We had a deluxe Sea view Jacuzzi room and whilst the room is a little tight with little place to put things (some draws or a cupboard would be nice) it is very beautiful and the view from the balcony overlooking the beach, sea and that wonderful sunset is heaven. We used the jacuzzi every day to watch the sunset with a beer from the fridge and it was lovely (not private mind you) but lovely and well recommended. Certainly one of the highlights of this place is the pool area and the comfy sunbeds and bean bags that surround it. Not having to get up early to save a bed was such a wonderful thing as there were so many beds all over the place (& even on the beach) that every morning we could wake up relaxed, have breakfast and then wander down and choose our spot, it made such a nice change and really made our holiday. The pool is big and lovely and the staff around the pool are great too, always there to get something if you want it and you get lovely towels to use throughout your stay too. The music around the pool is very low key and chilled and just perfect for a couple in their early 40's who just want a week of relaxing and reading. We also sat by the beach and that was lovely too with lovely view. For lunch we always went to the little tavern further along the beach which was really great. Only reason for this was that we found the lunch menu rather disappointing, we had a salad one day and it was all wilted and so small with just a few pieces of chicken so after that we just went to the taverna. Breakfast at the hotel was good although was a little heavy on the bread/pastry products so being someone who was watching my weight it was a little difficult.. more fruit options would have been good but they would make poached eggs and they were yummy and the breakfast staff were particularly friendly. Would I return.. yep its pricey but its location is great, its peace and quiet is great and with just an easy 10mins walk up to Mykonos town each night for a huge selection of restaurants, bar and even an outdoor cinema.. it really was the perfect location! we did a quad bike around the island one day only to realise we'd picked the perfect hotel in the perfect spot! Thanks Mykonos Bay and staff.   Room Tip: Sea view Jacuzzi is great.. watched the sunset from the Jacuzzi every night & loved it. See more room tips",1
"I wouldn't even know what to start with this review.. The staff was beyond amazing.. So helpful at all times, would do anything for us at anytime of the random hours my friend and I strolled in. It's a few minutes walk to the most amazing part of town of high energy bars and restaurants. But yet in such a private area with a private beach. The hotel will always feel like your own private. Besides the hotel being Perfect. Tzouliano who works at the pool bar made our trip memorable. He was so extremely nice and helpful and admirable. We would come back for the experience of him. This hotel is 10 stars. BOOK IT IF YOUR READING THIS... Oh and make sure to rent your ATV in advance.",2
"Mykonos Bay Hotel is located in a perfect position. 10 minute walk into Mykonos town. Away from noise. Beautiful pool, right on its on private beach! Rooms are smallish but beautifully presented. Breakfast is great. Room on beachside has amazing views. Love this hotel!",2
"This exclusive hotel is perfectly situated within walking distance to the busy city center, yet far enough providing some peace and tranquillity. The hotel is located on the bay of the Aegean Sea. It's all white theme with splashes of turquoise blue is so beautiful and makes for a surreal experience. The hotel has picturesque views of the sea. With the nearby poolside decorated with white umbrella shades and white lounging pillows surrounding a magnificent glistening aqua blue pool. The staff were fabulous, warm, and very informative. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"We stayed here for 4 nights while travelling Greece for 5 weeks. Its stunning location, beautiful views and gorgeous hotel has definately won us over. We would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone thinking of comming to Mykonos. Its out of the busy city and sits on its own little beach yet still walking distance into town. Its has the best breakfast we've had in greece and the staff are lovely especially the man who took our bags to our room, I'm not sure of his name but he was at breakfast every morning too. Very nice man.",0
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and I wish we stayed longer! We were picked up at the port by the complimentary shuttle, and drove us the 10 minutes to the hotel. Upon arrival, we received a free drink and fantastic reception service.Room - we stayed in a classic room - one of the more introductory levels (specifically, Room 19). It fit our needs exactly. We both loved how everything was painted and decorated in white - it felt like we were at a spa. The shower/bath tub was quite small and although i was fine with it, it may be hard for someone who is very tall. The breakfast each day was fantastic - lots of great hot & cold options to choose from.Pool Area - this was our favourite part of the hotel . A gorgeous pool area, large in size, with ample loungers and umbrellas. They also had large pillow-like beds that you could lay on if you wanted. The pool bar area was beautiful!Beach Area - we went to the beach for only about an hour, and although we preferred the pool, the beach was still nice with the sun loungers/umbrellas. Service - everyone working at Mykonos Bay Hotel was professional, friendly and attentive. They always had a smile and the staff was plentiful around the pool area. They were always making sure that the area was clean and there if you wanted to order anything - bringing it right to your lounger.Location - for us, it was perfect! It took us no more than 10 minutes to walk to the Mykonos town/Little Venice area. It was quiet at night and not too much traffic during the day, with the liveliness of the town was right around the corner. Best of both worlds!We will definitely be back!",0
"Extremely friendly, pleasant and helpful staff.Excellent design hotel, very relaxing atmosphere, wonderful panorama complete with a spectacular sunset.Structure perfectly maintained, everything is beautifully white except for a touch of green-blue ocean.All the recently renovated deluxe rooms or suite have a great design.The pool area is very nice and comfortable and also access to the beach is very convenient.The center of Mykonos is very close and can be reached on foot in 5 minutes.Classic room, not renovated yet, have small and old bathroom.Clearly being the hotel facing north-west (from where comes the Meltemi) the sea is a bit 'rough and not as nice as in other beaches to the south.Mykonos is a small island where you can find everything you need to spend a splendid holiday. The Cycladic architecture is wonderfully, all white and blue. There are very fashionable and expensive beach club but there are also free beaches. You can do reckless nightlife but also spend relaxing days. The climate and the sea are superb. There are many restaurants a bit more tourist and fashionable, mostly in Little Venice, but you can also find traditional Greek tavernas, family run where you eat very well without spending too much.100 meters from the hotel beach there is just a tavern where you eat very well at fair prices, while enjoying a beautiful sunset, but it should book because it is always full.   Room Tip: All the recently renovated deluxe rooms or suite have a great design See more room tips",0
"We love this hotel. More importantly, we love the people who are the heart and soul of this hotel. Regarding the facilities: the hotel is located on a lovely, quiet beach within walking distance of Mykonos Town (Chora). The oceanview rooms of the hotel have been renovated since our last visit in 2014, with a have a high--end, boutique-y ambience. Just stunning. Large comfortable bed and sofa, huge shower with frameless glass doors, multiple side shower heads and a rainforest shower head, and a seat to boot. Stone sink, under-counter lighting, floor lighting, etc. The air-conditioning worked extremely well. The pool and beach area are breath-taking; there's ample loungers so you never have to worry about NOT finding one available. The best breakfast buffet I've seen in Europe, with eggs to order, cappuccinos/lattes to order, pastries, fruit, oatmeal, local dishes, etc.. This is a quiet hotel, which we prefer. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. Panos, Pamma, Gordona, Ana, and everyone else (wish I could list them all) are so kind and accommodating; they literally wait on you hand and foot. They are friendly, helpful, and genuine. They make staying here pure bliss.   Room Tip: There is a difference between ocean-view and ocean-front rooms if that distinction is important to y...

This hotel was perfect for our stay in Mykonos. Stayed in deluxe room with sea view and private balcony with jacuzzi. Amazing view of sea and Mykonos while relaxing in jacuzzi made our holiday really enjoyable. Complimentary pick up from ferry terminal and drop off to airport was well appreciated. Breakfast was plentiful and service was warm and friendly. 10 minute walk to windmills and little Venice. It's located right on the beach.,0
"The staff were incredible throughout our stay at Mykonos Bay Hotel! Very great service during our three nights, and the location of the hotel was fantastic. It sits right outside of downtown Mykonos (10 minute walk) on a beach, and it has a large saltwater pool. Decor in the hotel is simple, elegant, and beautiful. The people were especially friendly and the breakfast was fantastic. Perfect getaway for couples, or groups. My wife and I would highly recommend this hotel!",0
"The location is perfect. You have a wonderful pool and beach at the resort while being wishing 7-10 minutes walking to the center of Mykonos Town. All the amenities you want are here but you are far enough from the craziness to relax. Rooms aren't huge, but they are clean and big enough. They are also cleaned twice a day. Reception is very helpful. Buffet breakfasts are excellent and they provide transportation to and from the airport and seaport. Great hotel!",1
"An absolute pleasure! Gorgeous location and facilities and the staff were tip top! Very attentive, helpful, friendly and beautiful! Very near the centre but far enough away to not be bombarded with tourists. We stayed in the apartments just above the hotel but still had access to the breakfast, the pool and the transport to/from the airport/port. My favourite hotel ever.",0
"This hotel was a great find. A five minute walk to town, yet private in feel with both a private beach and a huge pool. The rooms were sparkling white and clean and the breakfast provided each morning was ample and delicious. The pool is filled with salt water from the ocean so it is very salty, but also large and well maintained. They have a great bar and we ordered cocktails and watched the sunset every night. The staff was very friendly.   Room Tip: We had the room on the end with its own hot tub on the deck. Very nice! See more room tips",0
"This boutique hotel is absolutely beautiful but what sets it apart is the staff! My friend and I arrived at the Mykonos airport at 6 am and one of the members from the staff was waiting to take us to the hotel. We would have taken a cab since it was so early but the hotel reached out to us to remind us that they would gladly provide transportation to and from the airport or sea port. Since we arrived so early our room was not ready but the staff was incredibly friendly and did whatever they could to make us feel at home. We laid by the pool until our room was ready and the service by the pool was excellent. Within a couple hours our room was ready but we weren't ready to leave the pool! The music was wonderful and the servers were very knowledgeable about everything to do in Mykonos. Our server suggested a great dinner spot in Little Venice, Katerina's, and reserved a table for us on the balcony with a breathtaking view. The room itself was all white, cave style and very clean. We were even upgraded to a room with a hot tub on the patio which we used both nights! Breakfast is included with your stay and we were very pleased with everything offered. This hotel is within a short walking distance to Mykonos Town which was perfect for us since we did not want to rent a car or ATV. Mykonos is famous for some of its party beaches, which we had fully intended to check out, but we didn't feel the need to leave the hotel beach since it was so great. The beach is obviously a lot quieter and more relaxed since it is private but we loved having service from the hotel and enjoying the beautiful water. There is a rocky ledge not far from shore but if you cross that the water is amazingly clear and just perfect! On our second day, I approached the lady at the front desk about dinner suggestions and her first statement to me was that she had someone in town picking up our tickets for our ferry out the next day. This is so thoughtful and I really appreciated the effort they put in to remember each guest and their needs. Overall, I am so pleased with the service and the hotel itself and I can't wait to return!",1
"Had a fantastic week stay at this lovely hotel, food was marvellous , staff were friendly and very helpful and couldn't do enough for you, room was cleaned twice a day, wonderful pool with the biggest sun beds I've ever seen, including a private beach, situated 5 mins walk from town, my friends and I will definitely be going back again very soon. A big thank you to panos and his team for making our stay memorable.",0
"the hotel was in a great position , 5 minute walk to town but quiet and relaxing position. beach lovely, pool and surrounding areas lovely, sun beds the biggest ever seen. Bar food beautiful, breakfast first class. ALL staff fantastic, very friendly and helpful can not recommend too much , they really was the best . Would return without a doubt , second trip to mykonos and our first hotel we had no complaints but this hotel is a winner.   Room Tip: room 17 had two private terraces See more room tips",0
One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Lovely clean boutique hotel. All staff including cleaners and porters so friendly. Special mention to softie/jukianos/artenis and Anna-couldn't do enough for our group of six girls. Very clean hotel absolutely pristine. Breakfast great and all food and drink quality fantastic too. Especially the porn star martini made by Anna.Reception staff very friendly and always helpful.Wifi goodBeach lovely and pool area too with always a sunbed free.Windy a few days we were there which is apparently normal but I can't blame that on the hotel!Recommend 100% to everyone who wants a great holiday.Best restaurant for us was Avra where we went twice in town.   Room Tip: Ask for Sea view See more room tips,0
"We only stayed for one night at the end of an island hopping trip & would have loved to stay longer. Beautiful room with patio, sun beds & hot tub. Simple plentiful breakfast followed a great nights sleep. Only negative would be the walk into the town which due to the narrow busy road & lack of footpath or street lighting is off putting. Really appreciated the complimentary transfer service.   Room Tip: A room with a hot tub is good See more room tips",0
"Just had a wonderful week in this hotel and regretting its not longer. Hotel situated just a 7 minute walk away from the town centre. Breakfast was a surprise for our group - 6 women. We thought just the usual continental breakfast, but there is a whole lot more than that. Lovely swimming pool and beach - both with large size sun beds. The staff are so helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Everyone has a smile for you. Maid service in your room TWICE a day! The whole hotel is spotless.Would highly recommend and we shall be going back next year!Thank you for a great holiday!!",0
"Being the first time my partner and I had been to Mykonos, we wanted to find something near to Mykonos Town, but not a place in the thick of it! Mykonos Bay Hotel was perfect for this, being only a 10 minute walk from the town. The hotel is beautiful with a boutique feel to it, although it also has the grandeur of what you'd expect of a much larger hotel. We booked a double deluxe room, which was spacious and modern with all the amenities you would expect from accommodation within this price bracket. The view from the balcony/ patio was stunning!What stood out the most during our stay, was the hotel team. They had a infectiously warm, friendly and happy attitude, and they did their absolute upmost to make our stay enjoyable. They go well beyond with this, more than what you'd expect. A good example of this is when we became stranded in Ornos Bay (not far from the hotel, but taxi's in Mykonos can be hard to find, and we hadn't booked a car). As we couldn't find a taxi in Ornos to take us back to the hotel, I called the hotel to ask if they could book one for us. 5 minutes later, rather than a taxi, the hotel Manager arrived and drove us back. I travel with work, staying in many hotels, although it's exceptional that the quality of service stands out as much as it does at The Mykonos Bay. An excellent stay and we'll be booking up to stay there again the next time we visit the island!Absolutely recommended!!",2
"We loved this hotel.We were collected from the airport with no problems and had a really great week lazing around the pool,bit chilly for me but so inviting.Wonderful views across the bay, also nice to have beach area and grass.Great staff friendly and helpful.Our courtyard room was so immaculately clean and kept that way all week due to two visits a day by the maid.It was not huge but the bed was and very quiet and comfortable Every where everything was white but it is calming and restful.Enjoyed a lovely breakfast each day, they will cook you eggs any way you like if you ask, amazing selection of cake!We really had to give it some thought to find a downside to this place and all we could come up with was just give us a proper shower or wet room rather than having to stand in a small sloping bath to shower. That was all we could come up with so not bad at all.Also glad we didnt book the jacuzzi on the balcony rooms, they had no privacy we didnt see anyone use them.",0
"My family and I stayed 3 wonderful nights at beach hotel which contributed greatly to our enjoyment. We loved the hotel beach location so much that we stayed inside all day instead of actually exploring the city.  The hotel was an absolute delight very well decorated, super clean, comfortable beds, excellent location on the beach, and plentiful delicious breakfasts. Our room was luxurious and elegant with Jacuzzi for the family.  Entire ""awesome"" outstanding staff - the servers, front desk, manager, strives to provide you with an out of this world service. I can't thank you guys enough for a delightful, relaxing vacation.  One of my favorite dream hotel in Mykonos and I would book here again without hesitation.",0
in second week of june we stayed at mykonos bay hotel and it was memorable stay.we selected room with indoor jakuzi and it was amaizing expirence.sea view was also fabulous.good part of this property is location just 300mtrs from the town walking distance having beach.   Room Tip: corner room on upper floor has beautiful sea view See more room tips,0
"This hotel was a great experience overall. From the moment you check in and receive your wonderful and refreshing welcome drink, to the incredibly friendly and great staff to an amazingly well designed and decorated hotel, it's just plain awesome!! Although the rooms are small for US standards, they are very well laid out and very comfortable so it's fine! The linens and beds are comfy and the decor beautiful. The hotel itself is exquisite, an amazing pool with seawater (awesome again!); great pool bar and fabulous service and food. Can't say enough great things about this place; would go back in a heartbeat!   Room Tip: Ask for seaview double deluxe rooms; best view and size; only ones bigger are the suites.

After telling everyone last year this was the best hotel we had stayed in we had to visit again. Stayed for just 2 nights this time as we were jumping islands. We would like to have stayed longer. Beautiful hotel that sits on the beach. Everything is kept prestine White. The family and staff all go that extra mile to make this the best hotel especially Panos and Chrisoula   Room Tip: Ensure you book the beach view or side beach rooms and not the basic. See picture See more room tips,0
"We stayed for five nights in June at this hotel. The staff and accommodation were excellent. The hotel was only a ten minute walk to the town but far away enough not to be disturbed by the bars and restaurants. Our room was cleaned twice a day and the hotel was pristine, including the beautiful pool with sunbeds available! The staff were always happy to help with a smile. The breakfast was a delightful choice of continental and American foods with fresh pastries and cakes presented every morning. The sunsets are glorious and the hotel is pitched in a lovely setting to capture these. We would definitely return here!   Room Tip: The sea view rooms are the best. See more room tips",0
"Six of us stayed here in June and have absolutely no complaints. The location was great - close enough to walk to town but also quiet and on a private beach. The pool area is gorgeous, and the rooms are lovely. The decor and setting is breathtaking.But the best part, by far, was the staff. Everyone was so nice and accommodating! They helped us with every aspect of our trip and ensured we had an amazing stay on Mykonos. Highly recommend this hotel!",0
"What a stunning hotel! There were 13 of us and we had the best time in Mykonos thanks to this gorgeous hotel. The rooms centre around a courtyard so we were all close together. And there's a huge table area in the middle of the courtyard which is perfect for hanging out in in the evenings. Breakfast was fresh and there were lots of options. The beds were super comfy. The rooms (including the suites) are small but they are very well decorated, pristinely white and cleaned twice a day! The pool area has super comfortable loungers and the salads are excellent. The best part of the hotel though is the service. The staff are just so lovely. They gave us two bottles of prosecco as it was my hen party and helped us with transport. The hotel is also a 7 minute walk from town and a one minute walk to a lovely taverna with amazing Greek food run by a lady from Yorkshire. Best hotel I've stayed in for a while, thanks so much Mykonos Bay for making our trip and my hen so perfect.",0
"Just returned from 3 nights at the Mykonos Bay hotel and what a gem it turned out to be! Location wise it's a short walk to Mykonos town so easy enough to access all the restaurants and shops but far enough away to have great views,a lovely pool and its own little beach. Breakfasts were great too but it was the friendly and helpful staff that sets this hotel apart. The team couldn't do enough to help us. We'll most certainly be back!",0
Being the travel agent agent out of three friends I always feel nervous when booking our annual girls holiday as we all have different tastes. There really was no need to worry as this place really has it all.As soon as we arrived at Mykonos airport we were met by Nikos for the short complimentary transfer to the hotel.At check in we were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a Sea View Suite with Indoor Jacuzzi. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully designed with an amazing sea view.We ate in the restaurant for lunch on two occasions and the food was fresh and tasty The staff are extremely friendly and advised we could chose from both menus and eat by the pool or in the shade of the restaurant The location was perfect. Right on the beach and just a 10 minute walk to town ( in flat shoes ) Breakfast is not to be missed. Plenty of choice and varied pastries every day.It really is a beautiful place to relax during the day and a great spot to watch the sunset with a few of the amazing cocktails on offer before heading out.The owner is often at the hotel and the staff generally seem to care that everyone is happy and enjoying their stayI cannot thank you enough for an amazing holiday   Room Tip: Taxis are few and far between in Mykonos . We ordered from the front desk and there was only ever... See more room tips,0
"This is a beautiful hotel. They have very nice facilities, rooms, etc. However, I have to call out the hospitality. The hospitality of the staff of this hotel was amazing. We had the best time at this hotel and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",0
We have stayed in the Mykonos Bay Hotel and were more than satisfied. The staff is extremely helpful on all questions and the pool area is just beautiful and very spacious compared to other Hotels on the Island. Our room was clean and nice. We have rented a Fiat 500 via the Hotel and the car was like new. We'll definitely get back there on our next trip to Mykonos. Many thanks to Panus & Team!   Room Tip: It totally depends on your Budget. At the end you will very likely stay at the pool than anywhere el... See more room tips,0
"We are two adults that has stayed at the Mykonos Bay Hotel twice. In both the classic- and room facing the see. Overall Mykonos Bay Hotel is a fantastic hotel. From location, to how the hotel is run and the wonderfull staff. Both room types are very good but you get extra (design, size of TV, the view) in the room facing the see. But that is what you pay for. Depending on your wallet you will be very happy in either room type.The hotel is still value for money. The rating reflects this too. Let us hope that Mykonos Bay Hotel will continue to give us value for money and not get to keen on raising the prices due to the good reviews. That would be the only reason I would change hotels. If they keep it just the way it is I will return every year!",0
"Beautiful spotless, quiet hotel with a private beach. Sea view from the room was gorgeous. Very large swimming pool and comfortable chairs and mattresses at the pool and on the beach. Staff were lovely and helpful, Ms. Gordana answered all of our questions, helped us with dinner reservations, identifying the best bars for nightlife, car rental, etc. She is truly an angel who made our stay amazing. The winds were strong during our stay, so we rented a car and took off for the warmer and less windy side of the island, Ornos, Paradise Beach, Super Paradise Beach and Kalo Livadi. Mykonos town was a 5 min walk, the car we rented has a free parking lot right at the edge of the town which was very convenient. The hotel also had free parking. All in all, we had a fantastic stay and look forward to returning.",0
"Mykonos Bay Hotel is in a perfect location; a short walk to Mykonos town. The staff were all wonderful and accommodating. The best part for us, a large group, was that all the bedrooms were cantered around a beautiful court yard. The breakfast included a great selection of continental foods. The pool was very cold but it did not matter too much as we had a hot tub in our room! Whenever room service was requested, we would receive a knock on the door within minutes.The hotel really made our stay in Mykonos worthwhile.",0
Away from the noise but a short walk to the center of it all. Very conveniently located and secluded. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but clean. Overall it is well worth the money we spent.,0
"Lovely hotel, great staff coupled with an awesome location makes for a wonderful time. The sunset's were truly amazing! Would definitely stay there again and again!!! Book early because it does book quickly... And, it's definitely worth it!!!",0
"Absolutely beautiful hotel right on the beach. A short walk from Mykonos town but well worth it. There are a variety of different priced rooms to suit everyone. The hotel is immaculate and the staff extremely welcoming, happy and obliging. Breakfast available in the hotel and lovely food served in the pool restaurant . A pick up service to and from the hotel available . Would go back tomorrow and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.   Room Tip: A sea view room is worth the extra. See more room tips",0
This hotel is Fabulous... White everywhere and just 5 minutes walking from Mykonos town. Every single thing is been taken care by the staff. We interact with Chrisoula and Maria and they where outstanding. Chrisoula comes every morning and switch on the music and make the place lively... They try to give every single information you want and help in all respect... It's seems like your second home... We interact with Maria and she was really very sweet and helped us a lot to know about the beaches and restaurants in Mykonos... Thanks to both of them... You must stay in this hotel.,0
"This is a really beautiful hotel in a lovely setting & I would highly recommend it.. Email correspondence/ confirmation upon booking & prior to arrival to organise complementary transfers was super proactive & efficient. Right on the beach with spectacular sea & sunset views. Having now stayed right in Mykonos town, on a hill overlooking the town & at the Mykonos Bay hotel, this is by far my preferred location. A nice short, easy walk to town with spectacular sea views the whole way.The pool area was really lovely, (connected onto the beach which had hotel sun loungers) with great service & food ordered was delicious. My one negative would be in relation to my room itself. It must have been a 'yet to be modernised' room, as I found the bathroom quite small & of substandard quality. It did get serviced twice a day though. My room backed on to a road which seemed to have endless motorbike/ car traffic all Saturday night/ right to morning (party-goers coming home/ going out?), which meant quite a bad sleep. If you stay here, it is definitely worth getting an ocean front room - those looked amazing (& you won't have that problem!).Overall really enjoyed my stay & I wouldn't hesitate recommending to others. Thank you",0
"This is my second time to Mykonos Bay Hotel. Situated just five mins walk from Little Venice, right on the beach. If you want to be very near the town, but also love the beach and pool, this is the place for you!Renovated since my last visit in 2013, and now even more beautiful. White and turquoise theme everywhere, so classy and yet traditional too. Some fabulous new rooms with hot tubs facing the ocean. Everything kept spotlessly clean. Delicious buffet breakfast with everything you could want. The pool is beautiful, large and clean with comfy sun beds and big beanbags around it. Also free transfer from airport and back - which is only a five minute drive away. But my number one plus point about this hotel ...... The staff. What a truly wonderful, welcoming, friendly bunch of people. All working tirelessly to make your stay with them special.If you are looking for a small, beautiful, friendly hotel - this is the place. Look no further, you won't be disappointed.",0
"Such a nice clean hotel, fantastic food, fantastic view, great service and location. Really enjoyed our stay at hotel, complementary pick up and drop was provided by hotel. Overall fantastic experience.   Room Tip: Suite rooms with indoor Jacuzi See more room tips",0
"The hotel is absolutely white,spotless and clean. Had booked two deluxe sea facing rooms for a two night stay with my family.The free shuttle to and fro the airport was certainly convenient. We arrived early at 7 30 am and were immediately offered a complementary breakfast. They were kind enough to have our rooms ready right away though check-in was much later. Great location right on the beach and only a 7-10 minute walk from town. A beautiful big pool, a lovely breakfast and wonderful and helpful staff make this hotel a great stay.Would love to visit Mykonos town and this lovely hotel some time again.",0
"Returned to this brilliant hotel between 18/28 May in the same room as May last year (choose a double deluxe seaview room) Great facilities and stunning views! The hotel pool and garden are a delight ,with no pressure on sunbeds etc,they even have a number of sunbeds on the public beach which adjoins the hotel. Pool /garden service great for drinks and light meals.The hotel is an easy 10 minute walk from the main town,so most people choose to take dinner outside the hotel ,although the hotel restauarnt offers full dinner with an eclectic menu. Staff outsatanding! Enjoy the free transfers to and from the airport/port ! Will be back next year   Room Tip: double deluxe sea view See more room tips",0
Simply great. One of the best place where I'm never been in my life.Memorable moments from this awesome place. the service is impeccable . Very friendly staff.This Island is magical.Certainly I will return to this paradise.Thank you Mykonos and thank you Mykonos Bay Hotel,0
"I stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights with friends. The Hotel is immaculate and very chic, the staff are really friendly and helpful and the Owner always seems to be on site to talk to guests. We had a deluxe sea view room and the view was amazing. The pool area is really classy and comfy and they have a lovely outside restaurant and bar. The breakfast was extremely good and again wonderful views looking out to sea.The location is perfect and is a 10minute stroll from Mykonos Town.will definitely be back next year   Room Tip: Deluxe sea view room See more room tips",0
"Only 5 mins walk to Mykonos town, with it's own access to the beach and private pool/bar area, this hotel is perfect for couple or groups who want to enjoy Mykonos Town's vibrant atmosphere but retreat to a tranquil setting. The service is second to none. The lovely receptionist even managed to get us the last two tickets on the ferry to Santorini when our ferry service was cancelled last minute due to strikes. The breakfast is also delicious, you will be spoiled for choice!!   Room Tip: Request views of the seas See more room tips",0
"Landed in Mykonos by ferry with free hotel transfer made getting to the hotel easy and convenient. Our driver informed us about the area, weather etc. he was really pleasant.We arrived at the hotel, in awe of the architecture, colours, cleanliness and friendly staff. We were welcomed with a fantastic welcome drink and friendly reception staff giving us tips of what to do and where to go. Our room was clean, spacious and easily accessible. We had our own balcony but we used the day beds on the beach (hotel guest only) and the pool day beds more often. The pool area is relaxing, close to the bar and staff looking after us. We had long island ice tea cocktail which was really worth it :)They served a well spread breakfast. Be sure not to miss thisThe hotel is not in Mykonos Town but with a sort walk you will get to the bustling town. This fave us the opportunity to 'walk off' all the amazing food that we had while in town. Joanna's Nikos tavern is on the way to town and worth while to stop there for a lunch, cocktails and a fantastic sunset. Be sure to book in advanceOverall, we enjoyed our stay at Mykonos Bay Hotel. Right on the beach which seems to be private.",0
"My mother and I were picked up promptly at the airport by the hotel shuttle service and were greeted with welcome drinks upon check in. We were given a review of the hotel facilities as well as an overview of the town since it was our first visit to Mykonos Town. The room we booked had a partial sea view, was newly renovated and beautiful. The shower had multiple jets and full amenities which made us very comfortable. The staff provided us with towels for the beach and called for taxis whenever we needed them. However, it was an easy 7 minute walk to town. The breakfast each morning was lovely with quiche, various eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, assorted pastries and Greek specialties. They also hand passed desserts towards the end like rice pudding and chocolate mousse. We dined one night at the Alisahni restaurant and had the Greek pasta dish which was delicious. When the public ferries went on strike during our stay, the staff called to confirm ours was still departing. They assured us we could extend our stay if we needed. Can't say enough good things about the staff and hotel.",0
"Stayed here 3 nights with my wife... this is a very well designed boutique hotel in Mikonos town. Right from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms, we could see a lot of thought given to design... Staff: extremely courteous and will help you out with all the touristy queries:) Food: breakfast was excellent with a lot of traditional greek dishes. The restaurant whips up gourmet stuff... highly recommend the restaurantRoom: what can i say! Very well designed with exceptional views of the sea... we got an upgrade where we had a jacuzzi in the balcony. The rooms were cleaned twice and had an exceptional espresso machine... Location: its about a 10 minute walk to the main part of the mykonos town. Stay here to experience great hospitality and breathtaking views of the sea. Btw, the hotel arranges complimentary shuttle to the airport and the port.",0
"I stayed with friends for 4 nights in May. We were met by the free hotel transfer and on arrival at the Mykonos Bay were offered a drink whilst we completed our details. The rooms we booked were lovely, had great views of the sea and one had a jacuzzi on the balcony. The restaurant, pool area, reception etc were immaculate and the staff could not do enough for us. I cannot put into words how much i loved this hotel and Mykonos itself and cannot wait to go back.",0
"Great hotel, fantastic staff, comfortable rooms. This hotel feels new, although I don't really know if it is. Has great morning breakfast and a lovely pool area right on the beach. The room was comfortable and authentic but at the same time modern, although not well planned with nowhere to put your suitcase or hang your clothes which is a bit odd. Our room faced the sea with no road in front. Added bonus was a jacuzzi, although it wasn't very private. Very close to the main town, about 7 minutes walk along a very dangerous road, but the whole island is like that.",0
Everything is very good. We are very pleased with the hotel and you. We are telling everyone you and your city here.The employees are very concerned and helpfull.The hotel location is very good and very clean,0
"I didn't actually stay at this hotel, but I experienced first hand how wonderful their service is and what amazing people work at this hotel. They are kind, generous, selfless and caring and I am SO grateful!!!! I was going for a run, and fell off of a curb in front of this hotel and got pretty injured. Multiple staff ran out of the hotel immediately to see if I was okay, picked me up, got me ice, offered to help me with whatever, offered me food or water, and I am not even a guest in their hotel!! They stayed with me to make sure I was okay and even offered me a ride home!! I insisted that I could walk home and would be okay, but they insisted on giving me a ride home. They were so kind and so generous, I couldn't believe it!!! They are a wonderful hotel, with good morals and care about people even if they are not guests. I would have loved to stay in this hotel. I highly recommend it and just want to say a big THANK you to this hotel for taking care of me and making sure I was okay. The greek culture, people and this hotel have made such a good impression on me. Thank you!",2
"Stayed in hotels in Rome, Athens, Santorini and Mykonos and this was by far our favorite stop! Awesome staff, so helpful and nice, hotel offers shuttles to get to you airport and/or ferries, great location close to town, felt like we had our own private beach at times, pool area is super nice and clean, rooms were nice and serviced twice a day, breakfast was excellent. We really enjoyed our stay. The front desk staff even helped us get our ferry tickets and print boarding passes for flights. Would highly recommend.   Room Tip: We really enjoyed our sea view room, had a private balcony with our own chairs to lay out. See more room tips",0
"We stayed during our vacation in May. The hotel was very nice and extremely clean. All hotel staff are friendly and very helpful. This hotel provides free transportation to/from the airport which will save some money as well as a nice breakfast in the morning. The location of the hotel is perfect with close proximity to little Venice, which has shopping, bars and many great restaurants. Would highly recommend an ocean view room as the views of the ocean/sunset from the balcony are spectacular. Room tip-Pay a little extra to get the ocean view room, great views. The hot tub room is overrated as there is limited privacy",0
"We where stay in mykonos bay hotel in may 2016, when we arrive, the hotel driver pick us from the airport very friendly person (free of charge ). When we arrive to the hotle in the reception welcome us lovly risola, she tell as that even we order a room without view she will give us a room with view to sea (amazing room). She is amazing person with worm hospitality And help us alot to know the city and restaurants /bars.The view and the poll are remarkable and olso its really close to the center and its 5 min away walkingWe enjoyed every secondAnd will be back again for sure",0
We were upgraded to a room with jakuzi with amazing sunset view. Breakfast buffet was the best ! We stayed for 5 nights and they changed our towels 3 times every day. This hotel is very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Very very nice people... Would definitely go back.   Room Tip: Room nr. 31 had jakuzi in the terrace ! See more room tips,0
"Excellent staff, very very smiling-and not a fake smile, they were really nice to the clients. THey said YES to everything. This hotel does not know the Word 'no' :))Stylish, comfortable, chic, elegant hotel, very very good Value for Money. The architect of the hotel has a very good taste.Very central 5 minutes walk to town. Free Car park and a big car park :) Breakfast yummy, they had everything in bulk amounts. We say definately GO to Mykonos Bay Hotel !***** :)))))Didem, Istanbul   Room Tip: The room with a Jakuzzi :) See more room tips",0
Wonderful hotel. Everything clean and white. Greeted with glass of cold lemonade during registration. Incredible breakfast and hospitality. Allowed later check out and pool access with shower facilities after check out to accommodate an early evening flight.,0
"I had stayed out at Elia Beach the last time I was on Mykonos, and it was incredible. But even with a shuttle it was too far away from the main sights of Mykonos and Delos. (Plus the sunsets are better at this hotel, where I could see them even from my hotel room.) I don't know how to count the ways in which this hotel excels, but it starts with the owner and staff, who are beyond courteous. They do everything in their power to make your stay perfect, starting with picking you up and dropping you off at the airport (even at 5:30am) free of charge, even when booked on a consolidator site. Everyone always has a smile. At the beautiful sea water pool (which I thoroughly enjoyed, though many people thought it was cold), I particularly want to mention Sophia, who went out of her way to be both professional and friendly. She even helped me with my Greek. The rooms are typical size (I was surprised some reviewers called them small, but perhaps it was because I was the only one in a double deluxe sea view), spotlessly clean, with lovely amenities. While I prefer a bath, the shower enclosure had a seat. The balcony was perfect for looking out at Megali Ammos beach, part of which the hotel reserves for its guests. The restaurant, Alisahni, is superb, as is the poolside bar, from which you can order either from its menu or the main menu of the restaurant.I am probably forgetting something, but I want to thank everyone at the Mykonos Bay for all that they did to make it a wonderful stay.   Room Tip: I had room 24, which was great. I had a great view of the sea and sunsets. See more room tips",0
"The good: Great location. Beautiful infinity pool & views. Great cocktails by the pool (Dimitar was just amazing).The not good: when you charge 400 euros a night you NEED to have wifi in all rooms; we could not connect at all; that is unnacceptable for these prices. Furthermore, upon arrival we were asked to provide our passports which we didnt have at hand at that moment (we brought them the next day). Although We instead provided an international driver's license the receptionist kept insisting on having more proof regarding who we were! that was quite poor considering you can get on a flight using that driver's license.",0
"Everything about our stay at the Vencia last week was great. The pool, views, restaurant, rooms, location and staff were all great.The staff went above and beyond to help us with everything we needed. Highly recommend!",0
The staff was very welcoming and did everything to ensure we had the perfect stay. The reception staff and the pool bartender were top-notch. The breakfast and dinner at Karavaki were both delicious. The view is beautiful and the infinity pool overlooking the sea makes for wonderful pictures. Poolside cabanas and sun beds made for the most comfortable and relaxing stay,0
"We have stayed at Vencia about 5 times and love it. The atmosphere is relaxed and made possible by the friendly, helpful staff. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are comfortably furnished. The pool and pool bar are highlights - delicious cocktails thanks to Dimi and Vangelis! We look forward to coming back...",0
"Tried to book the junior suite again this year because we loved it and it's view so much last year but it wasn't available for our dates. We were offered the superior suite with a sea view instead so we thought why not for the extra money it must be superb. On arrival reception told us that we hadn't informed them that there would be three of us including our daughter but then immediately found my email requesting a room for three. They then said they wouldn't charge us any extra! This wasn't a problem they did sort it out very quickly but I felt it lacked a little bit of care and attention. They then took us to our room and as we headed towards the back of the hotel I started to worry a little I have to say I am a little disappointed with the superior suite we have been allocated, it is a large room and very nicely decorated (although the mirror above the dressing table is far too high for anyone to use) but the view there are two sets of double doors next to the bed which open out on to the balcony but when I look out of them all I see is the side of a building parked cars and some scrubland! I actually have to go out on to the balcony and look to the side for my sea view. Not what I expected for more than 500 euros a night.There are some other small things which I feel spoil the hotel this year, when you pay 12 euros for a cocktail by the pool and it's in a plastic glass it's just not quite the same I understand the practicalities but it spoils the luxury. Overall this is a beautiful hotel with a beautiful location but the junior suite was a far better room for the money- sadly not quite perfect for us this year.   Room Tip: 140 has a great view and is nicely appointed See more room tips",1
"Whenever in mykonos, we never look for another place. Vencia boutique hotel is THE place to stay. The location and the high standards makes it ideal for someone who wants a luxurious vacation with splendid view and excellent quality of breakfast, lunch and dinner!! The infinity pool will be the HIGHLIGHT of your stay especially when you experience the sunset at the same time...! Priceless, unforgettable memories....! Thank you!!!",0
"Our first visit to Mykonos and trip advisor helped us pick the place through previously earned award and customers reviews. Staff are very friendly and professional, product is well maintained, view and location are perfect. Recommended",0
"Nice hotel near city center; you could reach the center within 10min walk.Spacious room, nice bed.Lovely breakfast.The breakfast was nice.The swimming pool is big and there is an amazing view to the city and the sea from there.The personnel is really good and kind.Definitely value for money",2
"Fantastic experience at this hotel. From the moment they picked us up from the airport, to the day we left was the best service! Amazing staff, went out of their way to make us feel at home! Rooms were a good size, balcony overlooking pool, beds very comfortable. Only thing I will complain about is the small bathroom, and not much bench space. Best bougatsa I've ever eaten in Greece! The breakfast had lots of variety and delicious. I must say the restaurant was 5 star, one of the best places we ate in the whole town. Only problem is the walk down to Mykonos town, bit of a hike but coming up lots of stairs! Easy for us being fit, but could be a problem for others . Not good if you have bad knees I would recommend this hotel, and we will be returning <U+2600><U+FE0F>",0
"We were super excited about staying here after reading reviews on Trip Advisor we were however slightly disappointed. We arrived at the Port with a transfer booked through the hotel but no one was there waiting for us. After 30 mins I called the hotel and they assured me the driver was waiting. After another 15mins the driver appear, clearly just woken from sleeping in the car. The whole way to the hotel the driver then processed to complain about how tired he was and how hard he work and that people always made him get up early (he was also not impressed with we had to organise a 5am transfer for our departure). The rooms are nice but not at all big or modern and the bed was the hardest bed we had ever slept on. Some staff were lovely and helpful (pool side staff) but those at the restaurant for breakfast and lunch you struggled to even get a smile out of. The views are great and pool is wonderful. The hotel was lovely but I can't say I would stay here again.",0
"We had the most amazing time in Vencia Boutique Hotel. Everything was in such high standards and we could not compliment the staff enough. They always went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and were so caring. The rooms were lovely and so clean and the pool and restaurant were also fantastic. We can't wait to come back here! Shout out to Yanni, Antonis and all the girls at reception - thank you!!",1
"Dear Stella, Kristina, Dimi & Evangelis,We are back to Geneva after 6 days with you at Vencia Hotel in June 2016, and we still can't forget your smiles, extreme kindness, joy and happyness. Really.We had a wonderful stay.First, all the booking step was easy, fluent and friendly.We were welcomed at the airport and that was really kind and comfortable.Our sea view room has a real sea view (!!!), was clean and comfortable.The view from the pool is amazing : no need to go to crowdy Little Venice to have your Sunset drink : Vencia is one of the most perfect places in the world!We love your playlists, Dimi!! We enjoyed the gooood club sandwiches at the bar for lunch, we enjoyed the food of the restaurant in the evening.We ll be back next year & really hope to see all the staff again! (Please, stay!)Take care & have a wondeful season!Alex&Y",1
"We spent 4 days at the Vencia Hotel in Mykonos and loved it. Rooms are perfect, with great views and nice ammenities. The staff makes you feel at home and are always happy to give advise on the island. The view from the pool and hotel terrace is one of the best in Mykonos.Wonderful value for money.",0
"The View, staff, rooms and food are amazing! Wish we were here longer. Very central and the staff are extremely knowledgable of the local area and great for recommendations. If there was an option for a sixth star I would give it! Worth every cent.",0
"We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights here in June. We stayed in a Sea Front room, overlooking the pool and town.... with incredible sunset views !!! Located right up the hill from town you could not ask for a better location. And if you were too tired to walk back up the hill, 5 euros gets you a taxi ride up !! The breakfast was wonderful with so many choices as you dine in or out. We also booked the sunset table for one dinner.... very romantic !! Everyone was so helpful and accommodating... If you are planning a trip to Mykonos you need not look any further !!   Room Tip: Sea Front offers the best views See more room tips",0
"This is an honest review based on my experience at the Vencia. This was a pricey holiday for us (£1700 for a week), we decided on something a little more upmarket as we like quiet, tranquil environments and it wasn't quite that for us. What we didn't realise is that Myknons is quite a party town and at the Vencia the average age of guests were around 30-35. Most people here also for the nightlife, but unfortunately for us a bit noisy. Most nights we were awaken by people coming back from the clubs between 4am - 5am, or shouting with their friends in their rooms before going out (midnight). It felt like 18-30's for the slightly older, So for us, wanting a more mature place that was quiet it wasn't as special as we had hoped. Btw - the swimming pool is freezing - take your breath away freezing. There are also barely 50% of the loungers around the pool for the amount of guests staying. Most people do hang around by the pool as the beach is not close by. This results is the ritual of towel laying first thing in the morning and people hanging around hoping that someone will leave their beds. On the positives, it is close to town (5 minute walk). A wander through the winding roads and a good look round the shops was good. The hotel decor and setting is beautiful and the breakfast was good. We charged most things to our room and paid at the end, making it easier. Most staff are really nice, but we found the lady in the restaurant a little rude. We loved Susie q and Mojo the adopted resident cats - very sweet. Things we didn't expect in Mykonos:1. It is really windy. 2. It is really pricey - meal for two (starter/ main and wine = €80.3. Compromise either beach or town location.Would we come back - no",0
"his hotel was out of this world. Even better than pictured. We had the ""budget room"" - it was unreal. An adorable little stand alone stone cabin, just for us. The decor was totally Shabby Chic and I loved it. Very clean, bathroom was small (not THAT small) but practical and clean. The grounds are amazing, made to look like you are in Mykonos Town, with the stone paths and white houses, blue doors and bougainvillea. Then there's the pool - what can I say about the pool. A view overlooking the town and the sea, facing totally west so the sun sets right in front of your eyes. Sunbeds all around, an amazing pool bar and totally peaceful, never crowded. We loved being here, it was paradise. You are a 6 minute walk from town, there is a shortcut so you don't have to walk along the winding road - you just head down some stairs and pop up into town! We rented an ATV to get to the beaches and to explore the rest of the island. Totally fun and totally worth it. The staff, I don't even know where to begin. When you check in, they sit you down and explain everything to you about the hotel and the island. Right away we were wowed by how friendly they were. When I got to my room I realized my carry-on luggage got left behind at the airport - i think in the parking lot. The staff were calling and calling and dealing with all different departments at the airport, to help me find it. They sent a driver who searched high and low for it. When we thought all hope was lost, Angie (she's incredible) tried to call one more department, and they found it!! They did not give up even when I did, and I am so grateful. There is nothing this staff won't do for you. Evangelos was also an amazing guy - he works at the bar during the day and the restaurant at night. So friendly, nice to talk to and recommended a great restaurant for our first night. Breakfast was the best we had on our enitre trip. So much to choose from, everything was great!   Room Tip: Even the budget room was out of this world! See more room tips",0
"The hotel located in hill-top with 100% surrounding sea and city view, there is amazing to relax and sun-bathing in the infinity swimming pool. Although the hotel is not in the central of Mykonos city but it only takes 10 to 15 minutes from the hotel to centre places where you can find everything for eat and shopping. I enjoyed the walk from up and down to the hill because the view and little white and blue houses around is beautiful, everywhere is a good places for photo-shooting.The staff are very nice and helpful, they provided a plenty of information when you arrived the hotel in a first day. Also the breakfast is prefect, it is tasty and with enough variety, especially you can choose to seat at outdoor to enjoy your breakfast with a magnificent sea view in the moring.Everything is prefect and I will definitely to come again and recommend to my friend!",0
"We spent a wonderful week at this hotel at the beginning of July, the staff couldn't do enough for you, always on hand to help and assist if needed, and nothing was too much trouble.Rooms were a good size and lovely comfortable large bed, we had a lovely view of the sea and could watch the sunset directly from our terrace. The breakfast was very nice, everything was available from cereals, fruit, cold meats, cheeses and eggs and bacon. We also ate at the restaurant two evenings and the food was of excellent quality (the salmon pasta dish is stunning), could quite easily of eaten there every night but we do like to vary it a bit and sample local restaurants.The pool was quite stunning, overlooked the town, amazing views from the sunbeds. We had lunch a couple of times by the pool and the choice and quality were excellent, Dimi produces amazing cocktails and his gin & Tonics are to die for, we enjoyed most of the week around the pool during the day and Dimi and his colleague (sorry but not sure of his name, bearded chap, very friendly and welcoming too) made us feel so welcome.Overall the whole experience was a delight and would definitely recommend this hotel to others.   Room Tip: Worth paying a bit extra for a sea view. See more room tips",0
"Booked 4 nights at Vencia as part of our honeymoon - what a treat it was! The hotel is a short walk up the hill/stairs from Mykonos Town which can be a bit strenuous in the summer heat, but it is worth it for the views. Once you find the best route, you can be down in the centre of the action within 10 minutes. Rooms were very clean, staff were friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast spread was pretty good. Of course, the real highlight is the infinity pool looking over Mykonos Town - WOW! Pictures cannot even do the view justice, it truely is amazing!",1
"This is a great little hotel in a superb location overlooking the old town. It is well within easy reach of the fantastic variety of restaurants and shops of Mykonos. If you follow the shortcut from the hotel you can be there in 5 minutes. The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The airport free shuttle is a nice touch. It has a great pool with an amazing view (I would echo other reviews about the requirement for more sun loungers - basic German towel rules apply to secure the best spots). The wifi is very good and extends to the poolside for high quality sunny side surfing.The rooms are a great and a good size (be aware the beds are very much on the firm side). It would be nice if water was provided in the rooms daily (I would have expected this from a ""boutique"" establishment). However this is a fantastic hotel and would firmly recommend - efcharisto.",0
"First time at this Hotel and it has everything you would need. Rooms are very clean and spacious. The staff is extremely helpful, friendly and very warmhearted. Especially Toniac, Dimitrov and Vangelis. The food at the restaurant is very tasty and the service wonderful. Breakfast was also very good and offers a lot to choose from. We'll definitely go back. The location, nice room and pool deck and the wonderful staff made our first time in Mykonos more than extraordinary..",1
"I wrote my first review of Vencia in 2008 and now in 2016 I can look back on 10 really good holidays. Over the years I've seen several changes: the rooms, the pool bar, the restaurant, and the staff. The quality keeps going up, even when I thought there was nothing to improve on. What stands out is the engagement of all staff to make every guest feel at home and to deliver whatever you ask for. I've seen many loyal guests coming back every year, proving that Vencia makes everyone feel like a relaxed VIP in paradise.",1
"This was our first stay at the Vencia and we'll be booking again. The hotel is amazing and provided for all our wants. The staff at the front desk are very friendly and couldn't help enough "" thank you Helena""A special mention to Dimitar and his pool bar - He has the most amazing cocktails with fresh ingredients, plays amazing music throughout the day and creates an absolute atmosphere of tranquility. This is the first hotel were I felt I could spend my entire hotel within the grounds if needed - amazing",2
"Second time we have stayed here, and never disappointed.The rooms are always clean, staff on the whole friendly, nice mixed breakfast, great restaurant, amazing infinity pool, great location (5 minutes down the hill and you are in the town), great views of mykonos.There's not alot to complain about here; so the only things to be aware of/owners could improve are:- not enough loungers around the pool; same as last year - they should replace the chairs on the decking area for loungers as there's just not enough for all of the patrons- the management of the pool area could be better; there's a sign stating no reservations on loungers if you are away for more than an hour; this isn't adhered too and as usual ends up with patrons arguing and people reserving loungers but not sitting out at the pool - the staff needed to manage this better- would be nice to have a better pool good and drinks service offered while you are lounging (after all you are on holiday!)- replace that god awful toaster in the breakfast area as it's useless(!) And isn't enough for everyone at breakfastOverall the hotel is recommended; and you are sure to enjoy your stay.",0
"This was my second stay at the Vencia Hotel. It is simply a beautiful hotel, in a beautiful location. It is a 10-minute walk down to the town (or more, if you stop by the lovely shops en route). We didn't walk back up, but got a taxi from the new taxi rank - cost 5 euros. The staff are some of the nicest you will ever come across. The rooms are really lovely - either garden or sea view. Good quality linen, towels and toiletries. Breakfast is one of the best in all of Greece - served outside overlooking the pool and the town, or inside - a bit cooler. Recommend eating in the restaurant (separate review). And the infinity pool? Just fabulous. And Dimmy's cocktails by the pool? We only tried his pina coladas. Wow!",1
"My husband and I recently went to Mykonos as part of our Honeymoon and stayed at the Vencia Hotel. The Hotel was absolutely stunning, the views and pool area were amazing. The hotel staff were so friendly and always willing to do what they could to help make our honeymoon stay.",0
"Everyone has different experiences when holidaying, our experience of the Vencia was unforgettable. From the moment we arrived at the Vencia we were greeted with warmth and like family by the wonderful receptionist Elana, nothing was too much trouble and her friendly smile was both sincere and welcomed. The small touches like the sweets and postcards are lovely.Although we had not booked to stay at this hotel we chose to have a surprise dinner for my partner. When dining at the restaurant on several occasions we were expertly attended to by the lovely Mira who could not have tried harder to make our special birthday celebration more enjoyable. The food was incredible on every occasion, in particular, the day of my partners birthday where they laid out a wonderful sunset table with a fantastic setting for our party of 6. We chose to eat at the restaurant another 3 times on our holiday.Elena is a wonderful waitress and server, explaining dishes brilliantly, suggesting accompanying wines, and checking regularly everything was ok. A wonderful member of the team at Vencia.Equally as hard working is the fantastic Vagelis who is always around to help with service, keeping the hotel immaculate and welcoming guests to the hotel.The hotel is family run and headed up by one of the nicest Greek men I have met, Antonio. He is a happy, young and welcoming manager who made us feel like we would stay every time we visit Mykonos.Finally, if you have a chance to visit the hotel, even just for cocktails make sure you call in and ask for an amazing cocktail by Dimi, they are the best on the island. I can not say enough good things about this hotel, the views, the pool snacks, the great prices, the lovely spot close to the town all make a perfect place to stay.Thank you team Vencia.   Room Tip: Sunset views are a must See more room tips",0
"If you need to get there from a boat, they do not automatically provide a shuttle. You must arrange in advance. We did not know this and took a bus and then a cab. The hotel was very pretty , the rooms were clean, the shower was amazing, and the pool was spectacular. However, the beds are hard and not comfortable. I ended up laying on the duvet to give some padding. If you love hard beds, this will be a dream, but for people used to Memory foam, you will not enjoy the beds. The location is convenient to town without the noise. The walk is easy into town and not too challenging on the return, although it is uphill. We ate dinner and breakfast here and both were good, but not great. A nice choice, but they could become nicer very easily with new mattresses.",2
"We stayed at the Hotel Vencia for two visits of two nights on our arrival and departure in the Cyclades islands.Our sea view room was excellent with a lovely view over the town and although this necessitates a walk uphill on return from the town it is worth the effort.Breakfast was probably the best we have experienced for a long time and was of the highest quality with a wonderful choice.The infinity pool was superb with the most beautiful views and the highest quality poolside recliners and beds and an excellent pool bar.The restaurant was also so good that we chose to eat here in the evening on 3 of our four evenings rather than dine in the more touristy restaurants down in the town. Our meals were beautifully presented and it was delightful dining both inside or on the terrace with such lovely views.The hotel transfers to the port and the airport were also very efficient and courteous.We loved the hotel and will return again, hoping to do so for a special anniversary.But .... Sadly our last dinner was untypically spoilt by a very unfortunate attitude of the waitress who was petulant in responding to our request for some olives which were clearly listed as a component of our starter that evening. It was even more upsetting to be charged an extra 1.5 euros for them when they were on the menu as part of our starter - a rather petty event considering the total size of our bill at checkout.This all appeared to result from the fact that the staff that evening were almost exclusively preoccupied with a marriage proposal arranged by another guest. This was lovely to see and enjoy but sadly our dining was badly affected that night.It was sad that this happened on our last night when we had enjoyed our stay so much and were making plans to return for a special anniversary.It was for that reason that we initially decided not to submit a review as we take no pleasure in making negative comments about a place that we have enjoyed so much.We have now submitted this honest review after it was requested that we do so.Hotel Vencia is a lovely hotel and we look forward to visiting again.",3
I thoroughly enjoyed my weeklong stay the Vencia. My friends were all staying elsewhere and there was no room so I booked into the Vencia based on TripAdvisor reviews. Everything was wonderful and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. The pool are had much better views than the other hotels I've stayed in that are also close to town. Barman great. If i had one bit of constructive criticism is that the music that is played in the restaurant area during the breakfast service is so old school Musak. It seems it's trying to be something that won't offend anyone but it's shockingly bad and irritating. Something a bit more curated and modern would go a long way. Thank you for a great stay!   Room Tip: Sea views are great See more room tips,0
I could not have asked for anything more. The hotel has the most gorgeous infinity pool with view of the Aegean Sea and Mykonos town. The staff went above and beyond in making sure all of our needs and desires were metAll of my friends were very impressed. I will remember this forever I travel for a living and been around the entire world. I've stayed in thousands of hotels from small boutique to large super luxury hotels. I was really impressed with the friendly and professional staff. I will return,0
"This is a beautiful hotel with an excellent location. Walking distance to town. The view are spectacular!! But, the staff is what really make this place special. They are friendly and cater to your every need, We would stay here again for sure. Breakfast was delicious!",0
"Had a wonderful meal at the restaurant! The price was very reasonable as it was similarly priced to most average restaurants on the island but the quality was higher. The staff were very friendly and efficient, making the experience very enjoyable. The views were fantastic as you could see most of the town and the sunsets were beautifuk. Highly recommend!",0
"Our experience was wonderful - from chauffeur from the airport, only a 5 minute commute to the hotel, we were greeted by a lovely lady with great english and a sense of humour! Our room was beautiful, Junior Suite with Garden view (maybe the only downside is that we didn't book one with a pool view instead). But beautiful all the same, and had a really lovely housekeeper every morning who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. She even took all our clothes and washed and pressed them with such care (For 15 euro per large bag). Dimitar our resident cocktail and bar man at the pool was a great guy - and makes a wicked cocktail! The Blue 13 was our fav - fresh ginger, lime, blue powerade (of all things!) and blueberry vodka - delicious! His tunes by the pool soundtracked our day - from chillout beach house, to The Beetles, The Rolling Stones and everything and every genre in between. He made us feel so welcome, as did the two resident cats Mojo and Suzie Q! The restaurant was also lovely, and the breakfast healthy, varied, and had just a little sweetness thrown in with some yummy home bakes. We would thoroughly recommend this place to any couple wanting a beach holiday without the sand! The infinity pool with the view over the town and the sea was to die for - and only a short 5 minute walk downhill into town.",0
"The location is good and the views from the common areas are wonderful. The hotel was good, but there is room for improvement. We paid for a double room with a view. The view we had was at best a partial view. The bed was not a double/king bed, but rather two singles put together, which left an uncomfortable gap in the middle. The pillows were on the hard side for our taste. It would be wonderful if the hotel could have a shuttle (even as a paid service) or some kind of transportation to bring guests to town and back. The steep incline makes access rather difficult for older guests or those with health issues. The best feature is the staff. The front desk staff and the restaurant staff are wonderful. We love Antonia, a server in the restaurant, and another very cheerful young man whose name escapes me now.",0
"All the reviews we have read about this hotel praising its staff and wonderful views are entirely justified. Special thanks to smiling Helena and driver Stratos.However we both felt for a hotel in this price range that the lack of quality breakfast ingredients was dissapointing. We did not expect to encounter tinned fruit and carton orange juice when fresh produce is available at low cost in the town.No freshly cooked food,just conjealed eggs that had stood for ages under a hood. Cannot recommend the limited choice restaurant either. Far better available in town.We experienced much better in a hotel at one third of the price on Paros. So ""Vencia"", lovely hotel and Staff but room for improvement. p.s We are older experienced world travellers",0
"My sister and I spent two nights at the Vencia Hotel, and absolutely loved our stay. The hotel is beautiful, especially the infinity pool that overlooks Mykonos Town. We arrived early on our check in day, and Elena at the front desk was kind enough to let us have the buffet breakfast, which was delicious! Our room was spacious and cozy, with its own little patio we could relax on. What makes this hotel special though is its service. We felt so welcomed and appreciated, and loved seeing familiar staff faces throughout our stay. Elena and Christina were wonderful at the front desk. So warm and kind, providing us with everything could possibly ask. Dimi at the pool bar was also lovely. He was so friendly, and made amazing cocktails! We loved trying his special seasonal drinks. We had dinner one night at the hotel's restaurant, and loved it! Our server Mira was wonderful, and the food was excellent. Not to mention its beautiful sunset view over the town! This hotel is a wonderful treat for those visiting Mykonos. Its location is perfectly situated at the top of Mykonos Town, high enough up to have a beautiful view over the city, yet still a close 10 minute walk into town. We can't wait to come back soon! Thank you to all of the staff for a memorable and beautiful stay!",1
"I really like this place and I'm glad I paid more for the seaview room with the balcony. The hotel arranged for my airport transfers at no additional charges, upon arrival, the check-in was quick with the information briefing given efficiently. As I arrived early, the room is not ready but the hotel could store my bags and threw in breakfast for me. The lobby is open and very airy with sea breeze coming in from the coast. The seaview room I had was spacious, bright, tastefully decorated and very clean. The sheets and towels are all from Guy Laroche, very soft and comfortable. You will find all the toiletries you need in the bathroom. The power shower is just great to wash away all the sand accumulated in the beach. The infinity pool just sealed the deal with great sundowners and cocktails personally prepared by the bartender with the best sunset to go with the drinks. A lot of people talked about the walk up the hill. Basically the hotel has a private walk path towards the zigzag mainroad, for me, going to Mykonos town is only 5 mins walk away whereas returning from town (due to the uphill climb) is probably a 10mins walk max from the edge of town. Good opportunity for a bit of work out. All in all, I had a great time and really enjoyed myself here.   Room Tip: Seaview rooms, of course See more room tips",3
"hotel is overlooking Mykonos with great views, walking distance into town. The team always welcome you with a big smile, an exemple for greek hospitality. Rooms are very nice, pool is spectacular. Across a street a quad rental which invites to explore the island.",0
"Visited this lovely hotel 3 weeks ago and really enjoyed it ! The rooms are of a good size with nicely done bathrooms. The whole has a beachy feel and is very inviting. While we did not have dinner in this hotel, the dining room is spectacular. We did have breakfast and the buffet was very tasty, with minor menu changes every morning. The most spectacular thing about this hotel is its location. The view from the pool is amazing !!!! When wading n the infinity pool, the view of the harbor is simply awesome. The hotel is conveniently located above Hora (Mykonos old town) which is about 2 minutes away. Everything is walking distance from here : the windmills and Little Venice, the old harbor, all less than 10 minutes away. HOWEVER, if you are travelling with your spouse, chances are it will take at least an hour as you will have to stop at all the boutiques ! ;-) While we did not really take advantage of any of the hotel's services, the staff was very friendly and courteous .... which is representative of everyone we met in Greece ! A great spot to use as a base for exploring the island with a car and ATV rental across the street.",1
"great staff, specially the bartender dimitar and his cocktails are one of the best we have ever tried you must try the 2013* and the Secret cocktails. great infinity pool that overlooks the town, and great location positioned above the town offering splendid views and best sunset you can ever get. Everything you could ask for on a trip to Mykonos. We hate that we are leaving tomorrow.",0
"all of the staff was very personable and accommodating, loved the pool bartender Dominic (I think) he was very fun and friendly. The rooms are beautiful and very spacious, great buffet style breakfast, and very helpful front desk staff. Overall no complaints about this wonderful place!",0
"What a wonderful hotel! The staff was so kind, helpful and just delightful. Our room was fantastic, great view!!!The bed was comfy and the sheets so lovely. Breakfasts were delicious. Just a short walk to town with great views the whole way. The pool area is comfortable and the pool bar is fun. Try one of the special creations by the bartender. 2013 was our favorite.   Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view over the pool and sea. See more room tips",0
"Great food, great staff, great service, great pool that overlooks the town, and great location positioned above the town offering splendid views day and night. Everything you could ask for on a trip to Mykonos. We hate to leave.",0
"We spent some wonderful days in vencia hotel boutique. It's situated 5min walk to the center. Breathtaking see view espacially for the sunset. The food is delicious. The staff was amazing, the receptionists (Cristiana), bellboy and the waitress made us feel very comfortable. Thank you again for our stay!!!",0
"This hotel is more than fantastic! It compares to nothing!Amazing view strait to the sunset,minimal design and relaxing place.The staf are just incredible nothing is too much from the reception (always willing and smiling Helena) to the pool (best ckocteil by Dimitrov ) . The room was perfectly clean,comfortable, luxury and cosy. The breakfast offer is very rich and well stocked. There is a wide choice of cold and warm food and various sweets. We liked everything we had taste.I highly recommend this hotel",0
"We only stay in the hotel for one night but we wished we would had the chance to stay longer. All staff was magnificent, they make you feel you are special and help you in anything you need.The view from the hotel is AMAZING! The hotel is located is one of the best spots in the island and commuting to Mykonos town take you 5-10m walking and it is very easy.The room that we got was nice and cozy, beautiful view to Mykonos town and the big blue ocean, but the bathroom arrangement was a little bit odd (awkward design) and the small TV hanging in the wall look out of place. However, in a magical place like Mykonos and the Venice hotel you do not need a TV.If you go to Mykonos, stay in this hotel, we will be back for sure",0
I had a sea view room. I would recommend this. Staff very good. Very good breafasts Hotel is a short walk from the town. Hotel car picked me up at the port and took me to the port at no charge. Wifi worked fine.,0
"We stayed at the Vencia for two nights in May 2016. The period we stayed was before the high season rates kicked in. This is a wonderful property and going early May really suited us. The ocean and pool are cold but you avoid the crowds and you do enjoy great weather. Days were comfortable and nights got chilly once the sun went down.The room was very nice. Lots of wood used beautifully. Breakfast was great. Lots of choices and also lots of sweets. Breakfast on the patio overlooking the pool was nice.Our room was on the ground floor which allowed a bigger balcony than the second floor. Room was clean and staff very attentive. Yes, we received a welcome drink when arriving and a small briefing about Mykonos. Mykonos was very clean and very painted white. Nicer than Santarini.Will love to come back.",1
We stayed here for my birthday in May and wish we had stayed longer. Perfect for relaxing by the pool or exploring Mykonos town. Staff are incredibly helpful and we really felt like we had the full 5* treatment. Can't recommend this place enough and we are already looking at booking our return trip but for longer next time!   Room Tip: The sea view rooms are worth the small extra expense. See more room tips,0
Can't tell enough how perfect this place is!!! The whole feeling you get from the very first moment is indescribable! The hotel staff is so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too trouble for them!!! The rooms are spotless!!!! And the view from the pool unbelievable!!!Can't wait to go back!,0
"The hotel is wonderfully located, and our room was clean and nicely appointed. The front desk was not sincere in their helpfulness. We were a party of three yet they would only give us one pool towel, On the claim that they had not received their laundry yet. It was noon. So we needed to rent towels at the beach for 10 euros each.",0
Stayed here for six nights and loved it. The hotel staff are all very attentive and the food and drink offering is good and reasonably priced - I especially recommend the cocktails from the pool bar. Our room was nicely decorated and cleaned daily. Breakfast and pool/beach towels are included in the price.The pool and restaurant area is lovely with great views over Mykonos town from the infinity pool... It's definitely worth watching the sunset from here also!It's is just a short walk into the town/harbour and only a short drive/taxi ride to various nice beaches and airport.Would definitely visit again,1
"Next time I will stay longer at this hotel. Beautiful and unique design and very comfortable. It's hard to leave this hotel.Thank you for the welcome drink, the taste is very fresh.We had a good dinner with the sunset. And the foods are so good.Good pool with fabulous sunset view.",0
"This was a very cute boutique hotel tucked away about Mykonos town. It was a great location as it was easy to walk to and from the town centre. The views from Vencia are beautiful, as you can overlook into the ocean and into town. Upon arrival, you get yummy drinks and they sit down with you and talk about where Vencia is located, local attractions and how to walk to town. Very helpful with whatever questions you may have.The room was average, nothing spectacular. Cute minimal decor. You do get the sense of a very boutique and classic feel. The pool is one of the big attractions for Vencia. It has a beautiful view overlooking the town. Downside of when we went, the pool was extremely cold. Ice cold. No one was in the actual pool whenever we would pass by. It was warm, reaching 24 degrees. But no one ever went in. The pool lounge area itself was nice, lots of seating/lounging room.There was daily breakfast served and was average at best. Variety of selection, nothing great. With that said, there are items on the menu I'm sure everyone would be able to find something that would get them through the day. There is a restaurant within the hotel, Karavaki, which they pride themselves quite highly on. We thought it was over-priced, bland, and we did not eat there another night. Would recommend to stay here solely based on location and views.",0
"Our one week holiday at the beautiful Vencia Boutique Hotel is drawing to a close. It will be hard to leave. From the moment we arrived the service from Elena and every member of staff has been exceptional. The views from the pool are just fabulous. We ate most nights in the hotel's Karavaki Restaurant and the food and service was extremely good. The beautiful Mira really looked after us ably assisted by Vangelis. During the day Dimi at the pool bar played some great chill out music - thanks Dimi - he also makes an awesome gin and tonic. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. Next time though we would go for a sea view room with the view of the Mykonos Town rooftops and the sea beyond.Lynda and David, Blackburn, Lancs.",2
"First and foremost - organise hotel transfers! There aren't many cabs/taxi's on the island and so this is a must.Once you get to the hotel, the staff are very friendly and accommodating and the hotel is set out in brilliant white walls and it's just like walking through the town.My one negative was the walk back from town to the hotel... you need to be fairly fit, otherwise hire a quad bike! It's only a 6 min walk down into town but a 15 min one back up!We had a gorgeous ocean view room and early morning you can see the fog lift.",0
"My wife and I spent 4 nights in early May 2016 staying at the Vencia Hotel. We were in Room 140 which turned out to be a wonderful choice - the room probably has the best view of any of the rooms and is very tastefully decorated. I would definitely pick this room again if I was staying here.The hotel grounds, pool and reception area are all very pleasant places, and one night we dined at the hotel restaurant (very nice - the food was just as good if not better than many of the restaurants in town and it comes with a great view). We also spent some time just relaxing pool side and enjoying drinks and a light lunch from the pool bar. Breakfast is offered on the terrace and consists of a wide variety of items including cereal, pastries, meats, cheeses, eggs, etc. Overall most everyone would find something at the breakfast buffet they'd enjoy.Service at the hotel was exceptionally good. Everyone seemed to genuinely want to make your stay pleasant, and you got the sense that nothing was too much trouble for them.We rented a car during our stay on the island - in retrospect it probably wasn't necessary, but should mention that the hotel does have free parking. The amount of free parking is not large, but we never ran into a situation where we couldn't find a spot.One thing to bear in mind is that the hotel is located on the hill road above town. While the walk to the restaurants and shops of town is fairly quick (5-10 mins) it is obviously a vertical walk which might be challenging for some guests. The advantage to the location is that the hotel is removed just enough from the town to feel like you've got away from the mass of cruise ship passengers who descend on the town during the day. It also gives the hotel one of the best sunset views on the island.The one little grumble we had during our stay was that on two occasions we did not have hot water in the shower. Both times we waited a little while and the hot water returned, but given the quality of everything else at the hotel this seemed out of character.The bottom line - this really was one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Unless you think you might have a problem with the short walk down to town (and back up) then I can't think of a reason not to stay here.   Room Tip: Stay in Room 140 - great view with a sense of privacy See more room tips",1
"Our recent stay at this hotel was amazing. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The view is beautiful, looking over Mykonos Town & the Aegean Sea. We paid for the transfer to the hotel €5 per person, driver very accomodating & friendly. if you can afford the extra euros, book a sea view room, we moved rooms and the garden view/side sea view room was ok, but not nearly as nice as the sea view room. Breakfast was very good with many choices, from bacon, eggs & various pastries to meats, cheeses, breads & juices. We highly recommend a stay at this beautiful hotel.   Room Tip: Book a Sea View Room See more room tips",0
"What a beautiful place,hotel,and staff all amazing.From the moment we were picked up from the airport by our lovely driver (€5 pp each way) to the friendly Elenor at reception dimitar making cocktails Mira in the restaurant and the lovely lady who met us every morning for breakfast you know you are in a great hotel.we had a budget room booked but was upgraded to 126 a room with partial sea view.The decor of the hotel is a rustic colonial New England look. Bedroom was lovely could do with a bit more lighting to slap on your makeup. A fridge to use and free safe and hairdryer extra pillows and duvets and loads of draws for your clothes. PerfectBreakfast good eggs bacon fruits breads cakes something for everyone. Pool beautiful but very cold this time of year.",0
"We stayed in the beautiful boutique hotel for 3 nights at the beginning or May and we had an excellent stay from start to finish. We were collected from the airport and brought to the hotel where we were served a welcome drink and one of the lovely reception staff gave us a map and told us about the island. We had a lovely lunch in the hotel that day and dinner there that evening also. The food in the hotel, including breakfast, was very good. The room was beautiful and had one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in. We had a fantastic stay in the hotel, all the staff were so kind and helpful that we really felt at home. We hope to come back again in the future!",1
"We have visited this hotel in May, nicely decorated, the frigo in the room was empty, without even a bottle of water. The swiming pool is not heated so in extra-season is too cold to use it.The transfer from the port is a good value.The hotel staff are nice and kind.The hotel restaurant is over-rated , not a good restaurant, a bit expensive and does not offer the a fine variaty of plates.The sea view rooms have a balcony directly to the pool area and to the restaurant so it's noisy and crowded.",0
"We spent 4 nights for our second anniversary in this beautiful boutique hotel which is absolutely gorgeous... We received such a warm and friendly welcome from arrival at the airport from the lovely chap who collected us ... hotel reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful and gave us a great deal of useful information, especially with regards to sight seeing and the island of DelosOur garden view room was lovely and we could see the sea from our balcony ( beautiful ) bathroom and shower power was great. The restaurant staff were extremely obliging and very very pleasant they really couldn't do enough for people, impeccable service and so very hard working. Mira made us feel very comfortable at all times throughout our stay.. The pool area is spotless the bar manager Demi and restaurant manager kept the place Spick and span the cocktails which Demi made where absolutely lovely ... We were really sad when we had to check out as we wanted to stay longer however we have promised ourselves a revisit in the very near future .... Thankyou sincerely to the lovely staff at the vencia hotel Mykonos X",0
"From our arrival and orientation with Elena the staff has been excellent. Dimitri at the pool side bar, Vangelis and Mira in the restaurant were more than helpful and friendly. We would highly recommend staying here. Elena has been very helpful with navigating around town and food suggestions on where to go and what o see. We are planning our return as soon as possible. Camille and Steve   Room Tip: Junior suite was excellent. See more room tips",0
"We chose the Vencia Boutique Hotel to celebrate a bachelorette's party! The hotel is located 5 minutes away from the center of the city. You can walk through private stairs that will take you to the center. The hotel is gorgeous, clean and overlooks the sea. There's an infinity pool and a nice pool area with a bar as well. The receptionist and everyone from the hotel were kind, nice and great! They helped us to get around the area and took care of us from the very first moment! Breakfast is continental: you have a choice of eggs, pastries, cereals and typical Greek food. You can also book the transfer from the airport which only costs 5 euros per person. The hotel is located 10 minutes away by car from the airport. I definitely recommend you to stay at this hotel! It's simply amazing!",1
"Great hotel, superb swimming pool, the view at the hotel worths every penny you pay for. This is probably the best hotel in Mykonos if you are looking for great view and romance. I would recommend to enjoy the view of sunset in this hotel to make the most out of it.",2
The Vencia Hotel is an absolute must when visiting Mykonos Island. The service is amazing. The views spectacular. The rooms are very good. The hotel location is well located to downtown. The staff are great. Don't miss staying here. It is a gem.,2
We stayed in Vencia hotel for 3 days during our honeymoon in Greece in May 2015. The location of the hotel is just perfect... Away from the crowd and just 10 mins walk right to the centre of the town or the Little Venice. The hotel is beautiful and decorated tastefully. Loved our bedroom which was sea facing room and had a breath taking view of the town of Mykonos. Complimentary champagne was provided by the hotel as we were on our honeymoon. The infinity pool is just lovely overlooking the town of Mykonos and a special mention of the bar tender Dimitar Dimitrov- who is the coolest and friendliest bar tender I have ever come across- totally a people person. The service provided by the hotel was impeccable and attention to details were minute. Vencia is the only hotel that I have come across who provides Yves Rocher toiletries which was pretty impressive if I may say so. The breakfast buffet too was good. Total thumbs up for this classy and chic hotel and I recommend everyone to stay here on their trip to Mykonos. Totally worth the money.,2
"This hotel was paradise. It was the most perfect hotel. The views were amazing. The pool area amazing. The reception area had the most beachy natural tones. You felt as if you were in a really beautiful home. The rooms were nice. We had a normal room, nothing over the top, but super clean, well decorated and nice amenities in the bathroom. The staff was very nice. They did not bother us and we did not bother them. There was a nice quad rental place right next to the hotel and we took quads to the different cool beaches they had on the island.The only downside was that it was a bit far from the city center but you can take a short walk to get there, just dont get lost.",2
"We were recommended to come here and we were not disappointed at all! The hotel is in a great location, fab infinity pool (too cold when we went to have a swim), it is tastefully decorated and the staff are very friendly and helpful.We explored the island on a hired quad which was the best and most fun way to find a paradise secluded sandy beach where the sea was warm! We would come again!   Room Tip: The sea view rooms were definitely worth spending more to stay in See more room tips",3
"wonderful hotel and familythe hotel is situated little above town so you have a marvelous view pool area is loungy with big beds and nice barbreakfast is very good, restaurant is greatrooms are very clean , nice furniture, nice balconiesin total : a very romantic placedistance to town is easily done by foot   Room Tip: see view is best See more room tips",4
"We booked this hotel on our honeymoon and was the best one among all the hotels on that trip….the reception was very good, services was indeed better and food was excellent. The breakfast was amazing. They had good variety of food and great taste. We enjoyed every moment in hotel. The view from the room were awesome...first the pool, then the white buildings of town and at last the vast sea. Moreover, the hotel is located at a walkable distance, but at a height from little Venice; therefore giving nice views of whole town.   Room Tip: Roomes facing towards sea offer great view See more room tips",1
"It's located at the upper Mykonos town, view from the hotel is just amazing-white beautiful Mykonos town and the Aegean sea.It takes around 5-10 minutes walk down to the main town, but it's worth it.Its infinity pool was perfect with the fascinating view.People were very attentive and kind.Room was lovely and clean.I had the dinner with the sunset there and it was one of the best moments in my life.",4
"Vencia hotel is located very close to the city centre of Mykonos and has a breath-taking sea view, which is combined with the view of the pool. The general facilities and restaurant are excellent in regards to food quality and environment, while the stuff is very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend Vencia Hotel for your stay!",1
"Perfect location for your holiday in Mykonos! The view is perfect, town in walking distance, just love this place! Beautiful family hosting the guests! Counting the days to returning to Mykonos and the Vencia.gr Hotel.   Room Tip: Pool View (with Ocean View and View over Mykonos Town) :-) See more room tips",0
We stayed at Vencia recently for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon. We found the staff here so incredibly helpful and friendly! We also loved the pool and the pool bar. It has the most stunning view over Mykonos town and out to the Aegean Sea. Their cocktail menu at the pool is amazing! The location is great too - just a 5 minute walk into town. The staff give you a map when you check in and directions. They also put rose petals on our bed and gave us a complimentary glass of champers for our honeymoon. We were so impressed.,1
"We enjoyed Vencia very much. The staff was very friendly and helpful, including arranging for a trip to Delos, which was the main point of the return to Mykonos. Mykonos Town can be very crowded if the cruise ships are in. Vencia is perched high above it where it is quiet and the view is fantastic. The sunsets in particular are spectacular especially when viewed over the infinity pool. We upgraded to a room with a sea view and it was truly worth it. A bottle of wine on the balcony is a great way to end the day. One note. There is a walk to town of about ten minutes. It is down steps, down a winding path, down more steps and eventually you end up in town. Coming back, you have to climb back up. From the highest point of the road, it is another 50 steps to the hotel. When you arrive or when you leave the hotel provides a van, at a minimal extra charge to go to the port or the airport. But, when you just want to roam around you walk. This was not a problem for us, part of the fun really, but anyone with serious problems getting around should at least consider it. The breakfast was excellent and had good variety and it was included. Eating on the terrace overlooking the water was a wonderful start to the day. We really enjoyed our stay.   Room Tip: The ocean view upgrade is really worth it. See more room tips",3
"We spent 4 days at this hotel and it was an amazing experience. We had a driver pick us up from the airport for 10 euros charged to our sea view room. Checking in was a breeze and the staff there are friendly and attentive. The views from the hotel are spectacular, the rooms were confortable. We had a cleaner everyday, the breakfast is buffet style which can be had on the terrace overlooking the island. on our last night we had a sunset dinner at the hotel. if you would like to get to the town or Little Venice t is a 10 to 15 minute walk with a lot to see along the way. For the beaches you will need to get a bus just outside the hotel or book a taxi.   Room Tip: choose a room with a sea view, it does not have to be the ful view but still worth it. See more room tips",1
"From the moment we booked to leaving had superb service from the staff. There were changes to our booking with a third guest sharing our room for half of our stay and it was all very easy to make this amendment to our booking. Pick up from airport straight forward also. We booked a taxi to one of the beaches and this was simple too.Room was great, we had a standard sea view and the views were fantastic. We were on the ground floor so no balcony, but we did have a semi private outside seating area and I think room plenty big enough for 3. The rain shower was FANTASTIC and great pressure. Great bed and supersoft comfortable linen.The hotel itself is beautiful and stunning views of the town and Aegean sea. This alone is enough to stay here.Hotel bar was ok. In my opinion cocktails were good but not fantastic. It is right next to the pool though and shares those amazing views.The Pool was AMAZING!! It is a short walk from centre of town. 5-10 minute walk into town and 15+ back up. Though it is quite steep on way up and you really need to make sure you know the way down and remember how to get back. I actually liked being that little bit further and the walk back was not as bad as I originally thought. You don't get those views without a small walk :) :) and Mykonos is definitely worth a visit, such a beautiful town.Breakfasts are great. Good selection and really delicious. The eggs and bacon were especially good.Had an absolutely wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again, so relaxing and those views!! they speak for themselves.Free wifi also.An easy 5 stars however we unfortunately had an incident of food poisoning from a caesar salad ordered at lunch (process of elimination with the group meant that this was the only meal eaten by my partner who fell very ill. We'd had exact same meal for dinner and had hotel breakfast so it can only have been the salad at hotel.) It's a shame because we had eaten lunch and dinner on other occasions without issue. I know there are risks with salads but we're in Greece so thought it would be fine. If this hadn't happened it would have been 10/10.   Room Tip: Sea view worth the extra. See more room tips",1
"This is now my 3rd time to Mykonos and each experience has been unique in its own way.We arrived via Seajet and were warmly welcomed by Elleni the owner of the hotel. Elleni & Thanos (her son and manager) made us feel extremely welcome and as if we were at home and part of the family.This was felt more so one night on Thanos's Birthday were he had his family including Pappo and Yaya, his niece's and nephews amongst other family members and both Elleni and the Birthday Boy were so kind and hospitable and gave us plates of delicious home made food that beautiful Elleni made for his birthday.I can honestly say that I have a true brother (Thanos) and a second mamma (Elleni) and truly love them both very much for being so warm and loving and for making our stay so pleasantly wonderful.The hotel facilities are great - such as the rooms, pool, bar, Wi-Fi...etc and again I have to mention the genuine love that I received from both Thanos and Mamma.Thanos & Mamma I love you both very much.Efkharisto for your wonderful service and hospitality, but most of all for treating me as one of the family.May God bless you and all the family in your lives and all that you do.Once again Efkharisto polli xxx",0
Thanos the owner was fantastic. Picked us up from the airport with a huge smile on his face.. Gave us a detailed explanation of the town and showed us through the hotel.The rooms were above expectation (better than pictures on the website). We had a room near the pool..Thanos was super helpful and friendly... Best hospitality we've had on our trip so far. The hotel is like a mini resort.. Thanos went out of his way to accommodate us. The food and drinks at the hotel were great and very affordable.There is only 30 taxi's on the island so Thanos helped us book taxi's and drove us around to different destinations. Was great and well above expectation.We'll be back for sure! Thanks again :),0
After visiting Mykonos for a numbe of years now and having visited other hotels I can say that this ks the best hotel we have been to. The hotel is owned by a local family whose aim is to provide the best hospitality to its customers! Whatever you ask for they are ready to accomodate or are always at your service! They offer airport rides and are able to help to rent a car.The rooms have an all white minimal decor and are cleaned every day. Everything is very clean!Its location is perfect because its right on top of the town and next to the main road that leads to all the beaches.The view from the swimming pool is amazing especially for the sunset!The best hotel :),0
"Family owned - so friendly and helpful!! They were truly the best part. Would go back again ! rooms very clean- nicely done- good but basic breakfast. Our room near the pool was small but fine for us- no ""terrace"" but also fine as right near pool ( #17) ONLY issue is it IS a hike back and forth to town. There are several ways to go though so don't have to just take their path. The view and pool was great though so worth it   Room Tip: all rooms are good- we liked being near the pool so that was good for us ( 17 ) but has no chairs ou... See more room tips",0
"I will give Damianos a five-star just based on the hospitality of the owners / staff. They recommended things to do, helped us rent a bike, suggested nice restaurants etc. Also, provided a pick and drop to the port / airport..The rooms are nice and clean, the pool is clean and well-maintained - good for a swim on a warm summer day. Also, you can get good views of the town from the property.. Its also just a 10 mins walk to the Mykonos town.",0
"My family and our friends have spent 5 wonderful days in Mykonos, thanks to the owners of Damianos hotel - Mr.Thanos and his family. They are very nice and friendly and are doing their best to accommodate customers' needs. Rooms are nicely decorated, bathroom large and clean. The breakfast is also excellent and the pool clean with great view . We highly recommend this hotel, we would definitely choose it again if we ever come back in Mykonos.",0
"This is one of the best hotel in Mykonos not only for the great views of the bay, the amazing sunsets and the nice and clean rooms but above all for the fantastic owners of this hotel that make you feel at home from the moment they come and pick you at the airport. Thanos, his mother Helen and the rest of the staff work really hard to make every moment there the most enjoyable possible!   Room Tip: sea view room are the best with terrace See more room tips",0
Nice and clean. Friendly staff. The food is amazing for a hotel. The pool area is great with a nice view of the sunset. Close enough to the town. I would definitely recommend this hotel. If your shower water is cold just call and they'll turn the hot water on for you.,0
"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while we were in Mykonos. It was awesome! It is a family hotel and is small so you feel welcomed right away. We were picked up at the Port by hotel staff and they drove us directly to the hotel, showing us the shortcuts to get into town along the way. We were given a map that outlined most of the attractions in town and were given lots of information on how to access beaches etc. We booked an ocean view room and it was stunning. Extremely spacious, and the bathroom was large and updated. The hotel staff cleaned our room everyday and even took time to fold our clothes. The pool at the hotel is superb and very relaxing. We spent several days at different beaches along the island and decided to spend our last day all at the hotel pool because it is so relaxing. You can order drinks and food from the bar, and they play music poolside too. There is a bus stop right outside of the hotel, which makes it very easy to get to the Elia beach. From there you can take a water taxi for 5 Euro to the other beaches if you would like. We took the bus from the town center one day to go to paradise beach, but that was so crowded. It would be better to go to Elia first and then go from there to other beaches. The restaurant in the hotel was the best food we had on the island. We ate there for dinner one night and it was amazing. We had a greek salad, which was huge, A fried cheese plate and a Souvlaki plate. Everything was so good. And it is very reasonably priced, much cheaper than the restaurants in town and much better. At the end of dinner they gave us free dessert. The staff really do treat you like family. There was another couple staying at the hotel while we were there, and they come back to this hotel every year. The hotel staff knows them, made them special meals and brought them special drinks. It was really fun to see. At the end of our stay, the hotel staff drove us to the airport. The service is great and the staff really do everything to make your stay perfect. We would definitely stay here again!",0
Very friendly staff! Even more. In this hotel you get the feeling to be at home. Since the staff treats they're guests like family. The room was absolutely clean. The service was just perfect. I've been picked up from the airport and they brought me back to the airport. And that was included. Prices more than resoanable! I reccomend it at anytime and I can't wait to be back there! Thank you to all the staff for this memorable stay!!!!,0
"I stayed there with a friend for one week. its and incredible service and staff, amazing! Its a family business! the son of the owner picked us up at the airport! he gave us all the important informations about the island and a very helpful. we got an absolutely beautiful room, very clean and modern! the breakfast is great, there is everything you need! also the pool is perfect! One night we had a diner at the hotel restaurant, there are good choices and the food is yummy. also the prices are very fair! We wanna say a BIG thank you to all the staff, who treated us so well and they made all our wishes come true! we can't wait to come back! best hotel!",0
"Loved our stay here at Damianos! Good location, immaculate rooms, fantastic views, amazing staff, great food and cocktails at a very reasonable price (compared to the town). Thanos and his staff, Giorgia, Franskula and Anna could not do enough for you and we had some great nights in the bar, thanks to you all!We really do miss our beautiful views whist having breakfasts and evening drinks.",0
"Stayed in a partial sea view room. Room has no windows and sea view is from the chairs and table outside the room. Perfect location to town and buses for beaches free airport or port transfers, super nice family service, and great breakfast. Pool and views from pool + lobby/breakfast area are fantastic! A++ value for money!",0
"Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The location is great as its only a 10 minute walk into the town, the footpath has lots of steps and quite dark so you may want to get a taxi back! Hotel is spotlessly clean in all areas. The room was a nice size and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was ok but a little more variety would have been good. The pool is set with a lovely view across the town where you can see the cruise ships in the port. We were picked up from the airport and also taken to the port for our trip to Paros. All of the staff were friendly. We had lunch a couple of days and the food was good. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.",0
We stayed here last week on our way through the Greek islands. From the moment we were picked up at the airport we were treated like old friends. The staff couldn't do enough to make our stay special and we're happy to take us to our ferry after we checked out. It is a must for a stay in Mykonos and can't speak highly enough of the service we received. They will definitely be seeing us again!Mat and Mel,0
"We spent only one night there and we are so glad we choose this hotel. The staff is really nice and will do anything to help you with your stay. The rooms look even better than on the picture. The swimming-pool is beautiful and quiet, perfect for a break in the afternoon. And you can even have a panoramic view while enjoying your breakfast ! I highly recommend it.",0
"The Damianos family was very, very accommodating throughout our stay at their hotel. From picking us up at the airport to serving us an amazing breakfast to marking up a map with all of the restaurants and sites we needed to see in Mykonos, they were great! The rooms were very clean and the pool area was beautiful. The hotel is conveniently about a 5-10 minute walk from Mykonos Town, but just be warned that it is straight uphill with little rest. We opted to rent an ATV to beach hop around the island (and help us go up and down the big hill)! The hotel is right by the bus stop if you prefer to get around that way. Lovely stay!!",0
"We were absolutely blown away by our experience at Damianos. We came in by Ferry at 9.30 Am and was picked up by the owner herself. The hotel is beautiful . It is fairly high above town and a 10 min walk down the hill, but as a result the view is magnificentOur room was simple but clean and elegant with all the amenities we needed. It opened out to the patio which is also the outdoor dining area. They have a full bar and restaurant. The breakfast was excellent. They have staff at the bar/restaurant almost all day.The pool is perfect. They provide poolside service as well, something I had not expected. What made the experience most memorable was the way the staff treated us as if we were special family guests. When we walked up from town on a hot afternoon, the lady at the bear immediately came over and gave us water( we had not even asked for it). we had a small snack later in the evening and couple of drinks. the quality was as good as at any 5 star hotel without the formal atmosphere. You should note that it is at some height above town and the path down(and up) is irregular with several flights of steps as well. However there is a bus into town which stops in front of the hotel. We stayed at 5 star Hotels at other places during our trip but Damianos is one we felt was the most memorable. We would not think of staying anywhere else if we are lucky enough to go back to Mykonos.",0
They are so accommodating and lovely! Working 24/7 at everyone's beck and call and nothing is too much of a hassle for them.It's really really nice. We felt so welcomed and loved staying at Damianos Hotel. Room was clean and everything we needed. Food was great and overall hotel is perfect and so picturesque! Great place to stay and will be recommending to everyone heading to Mykonos.,0
"Be prepared to be amaze by the teams ability to make you feel at home. Hotel owner Tanos was beyond hospitable as they go over the the call of duty for their guest. I will come back just for the feeling home in this hotel. Amenities, food, rooms, and pool are better than a five star hotel. They take pride in their family own business. For the price it is well worth it.Josephine, New York   Room Tip: book for hospitality,amenities and service See more room tips",0
"An amazing family run hotel, spotless , excellent food, amazing views ,rooms were good size and well kept, nothing was any trouble.The walk to the town was 10 minutes away downhill not too bad going back up the hill.Thanos was a great guy made you feel very welcome, a bonus free transfers .He really helped us when we had to leave in a hurry as ferries went on strike and the last ferry to leave Mykonos went within the hour, we packed and Thanos had us at the port in good time.We will definitely be returning.",0
"We stayed here three nights on the first leg of our 10 days island hopping.First, lots of positives:- a very warm welcome with airport pick up and port transfer on leaving, and personable service throughout the whole stay, they really care for their guests here- a small but lovely pool with comfortable sunbeds and shade makes a great place for relaxing- a really nice buffet breakfast, including cereals, fruits, yoghurts, jams, breads, eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, pastries and hot and cold drinks - they were able to provide us gluten free bread at breakfast on prior notice which was appreciated- the one dinner we had there was also nice and reasonable valueJust a few negatives:- the hotel is a very steep walk up multiple sets of steps from the waterside area, which was tiring when needed a few times a day, so bear that in mind if you are without transport- we opted for the cheapest budget room on purpose, and while it offered excellent value and was pleasantly decorated and had a good bathroom, it was a little dark and damp (and as advertised, with no balcony or terrace and only one small window) and the beds weren't particularly comfortable- reliable wifiIf you don't mind the location and are happy to accept the limitations of the budget room or pay more for a better class of room, this would be a good choice",1
"We stayed here for three nights for our honeymoon and it was a brilliant start to the holiday. We were picked up from the airport and given lots of information about the island which was really helpful, and the location was perfect for walking to and from Mykonos Town. The walk back was up a steep hill but that is to be expected and means you get fantastic views. The pool area was lovely and relaxing. We had a basic room which was comfortable and very clean and had everything we needed. The room was excellent value for money, however next time I would probably spend a bit more and get a room with a balcony although it didn't matter too much as we were hardly in the room and we spent a lot of time at the pool area. Breakfast was quite basic but pleasant, and we enjoyed sitting on the terrace eating breakfast every day.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only improvement I would suggest is that I had mentioned in the reservation and in an email that we were on our honeymoon, and there was no acknowledgement of this when we arrived. I did not expect any special treatment and didn't think much of it at the time, however staff at hotels we stayed at on the other islands were so lovely and gave us flowers, handwritten notes and complimentary wine, which naturally gave us a more favourable view of those hotels in comparison to Damianos. However, this did not change the fact that this is a lovely hotel that is very reasonably priced and we would not hesitate to come back again. Thank you for a lovely stay.",0
"Thank you for the fantastic time, beautiful hotel, helpful staff!! Long walk to the beach however we hired an ATV so it was easier! Thank you Helen for driving us to and from the port. Thank you to the waiter staff as well amazing meals!",0
"Stayed here for 2 nights and didn't want to leave. Room was comfortable; had an amazing sleep on the bed! Staff treated us like family, checking on us at every turn and making sure our needs were well taken care of. When they heard we were heading to the beach, they passed us towels to take along. Breakfast though simple was good. The views from the restaurant were killer. Thanks for a wonderful stay.",0
"I'm sitting here on the back patio restaurant of Damiano's savoring some great fare and thinking how wonderful life is with the view of the Aegean as a back drop. The beds here are the must comfy we've found in Greece. The family run attitude is clearly present as mama and sin, Thanos are always around to get you and ask how your day is going. Kalimera, everyone!",0
"What an amazing place , from the moment we were met at the airport by the manager thanos he welcomed us with open arms , the hotel is immaculate maid service everyday including clean towels we stayed in room 25 superior with sea view absolutely stunning ,our ten year old son got a prickly heat rash and went to room for a while , there was a knock at the door and staff had brought him a giant kinder egg to cheer him up , the service is above and beyond also they even baked him a cake and sliced it up for him . Breakfast is lovely fresh croissant , cereals , fruit , toast , bacon very nice served under the veranda with sea views , we got a taxi back up each night due to steep climb but only 5 euros so not bad at all , I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel they deserve to do very well",0
"The hotel is centrally located, 10 mins walk to Mykonos city, with a great view of the mykonos city and sea . Asthetically designed with Greek elements , Damianos is a cute hotel and good value for money. What delights you is the awesome service .The owner of the hotel Thanos is a very friendly, charming and hard working guy. Definitely knows a thing about customer service and how to please his guests always with an amicable demeanor and warm smile. The rooms are cosy and comfortable , fresh smelling and clean. Has a mini bar . The pool is nice and the hotel has a lovely lounge too. The hotel has a restaurant with very good food and amazing prices considering that the city of Mykonos is so expensive. perfect for young couples who want a comfortable accomodation without having to burn a hole in their pockets. The only thing that could be improvised is probably Breakfast, it is included and is average.All in all me and my husband had a great stay at this hotel, was received and dropped at the airport by Thanos with his charming smile , a true gentleman. Damianos is a family run hotel and you can feel the warmth of a family when you stay here with the staff always serving you with a smile.Totally recommend this , thumbs up",1
The hotel is located above the main town. The free shuttle from the port and to the airport at the end were efficiently run. The room was very comfortable and spacious enough. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The buffet breakfast was of a very high quality ... and there is a swimming pool. Good bus connections can get you to wherever you want to go and the beaches are very fine.,0
"We stayed here for 3 days in April . It was just the start of the tourist season. The owner of the hotel was himself running the show at this hotel. He was very friendly and helpful and because of him, our stay at the hotel was so much better. Its located just outside the main town (Chora) where most of the properties are. The rooms are spacious.",0

"We stayed for just one night on our way back from other islands. We were met at the new port by Helen and driven to the hotel. The price we paid also included a lovely buffet breakfast and a transfer to the airport so it was not only good value but also we didn't have to think about planning and could just relax. The staff were fab - friendly, smiling and helpful. The beautiful pool has lovely views of the town and you can have drinks served beside it - luxury! The hotel is on the hillside above the town and there's a path which leads down - it takes about five minutes to get to the centre. If you don't fancy the walk back up, a cab costs five euros. There's also a bus stop nearby. The rooms with the best views are: 26, 27, 31, 14, and the ones that are completely without a view are 13, 28, 29, 30. We stayed in room 24 (a twin) with a lovely bathroom and plenty of space. It also had a fridge (conveniently located inside a cupboard to cut down noise) along with a small safe, and a TV. We had plenty of room and all the switches, sockets etc worked. And there was no smell of smoke (we've had so many rooms that have smelled of it).   Room Tip: The rooms with the best views are: 26, 27, 31, 14, and the ones that are completely without a view a... See more room tips",0
"We used this hotel to stay for our first and our final night, having holidayed on Paros & Anti Paros. We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. Thanos is a great host and he, his mother and all the staff made us so welcome.Our room was excellent, air conditioned, with a comfortable king sized bed and a beautiful modern bathroomThe whole hotel, including its swimming pool, is absolutely immaculate. Breakfast was very good and we also had an lovely evening meal which was reasonable priced.The view of the sunset from the terrace was memorable. From its elevated position overlooking the bay, it's a 10 minute walk down the steps to the Town. If you don't want to walk back uphill, a taxi from the Town or Little Venice is only 5 Euros. We will be back !   Room Tip: We had room 31, lovely sea view & small balcony with deckchairs. See more room tips",1
"This hotel is wonderful and a wonder in terms of value. The owner met us at the boat and took us to hotel - this is a complementary service. This guy is totally cut out for his business - small guy with a big generous extrovert personality - very attentive to each person and a great sense of humour. As he explained to us where to go and how with yet another great local free Greek Island/city map, he saw a little girl wander around a corner and called out to his Mom to care for her which she instantly did and in a grandmotherly way. Very friendly family. Our partial seaview room was large, simple and modern with a comfortable bed. The view from our outside veranda was great - a total sunset view. As we were getting a 6:30 flight the next morning so we did not have the breakfast included in the price - but the hotel offered to prepare a takeaway breakfast - so nce and thoughtful.This hotel is located 500meters above Mykonos twn. There is a beautiful pool, restaurant, bar and lots of private areas to watch the sunset from.",0
"Thanos was an amazing host, emailed us months in advance, gave us a mini brief about the island, commuting around, directions and the places of interest. The free transfers provided from the airport and the ferry port were a welcome addition to their great service. The hotel is also very clean, room is great and comfortable, well located near the main town (the Chora) and all the attractions are within a short walking distance from the hotel. Breakfast spread is pretty decent and the breakfast view is gorgeous. Price of food from their menu is cheaper than most restaurants in Chora and it was delicious! And the sunset view from the pool deck is simply amazing. We would not think twice to stay here again should we go to the island again. 5 stars service at an affordable price. Thank you",0
"We stayed there for 2 nights and the experience was amazing. The hospitality was so good that we felt like we are staying at a friends place. Amazing sunset views. Would love to return here again :)Only low point was while leaving, we had an early flight to Athens and so requested the hotel staff for a taxi to airport which didn't show up even though they had assured us. We called up the Radio taxi which came pretty soon and thankfully we didn't miss our flight.",0
"This place is up the hill from the hustle and bustle of Mykonos. The best way into and out of town is up and down the hill. I made it with just a little huffing and puffing and I have had 2 knee replacements, so unless you're really out of shape - no problem!The breakfast is wonderful, and sitting with the gorgeous view is just an extra treat. The food was all freshly made and the family does the serving.They pick you up at the ferry and take you back, nothing to worry about except how to spend your time, in town, at the island of Delos, or in the pool.",0
Visited this luvly hotel for 3 nights to join friends who come every year. It's a little gem at the top of the hill overlooking mykinos town and the sea. Lovely rooms which are clean and perfectly functional great sunbathing areas and small pool all you really need . The bar snacks and drinks are great and good value and extremely good value for money as breakfast and airport transfers are included. What makes it v special is the staff - family run and so friendly and accommodating they go out of their way to ensure you are well looked after. The town bars restaurant and beaches are fab. I wiil be back!! Thanks for a great stay,0
My husband and I stayed for just one night.. We were island hopping.. We were picked up by Thanni from the airport.. What a lovely welcome he gave us.. The room was amazing.. Top class.. So clean and luxurious.. Breakfast was really good.. Plenty of choice and lots of good coffee.. Speciality teas and normal tea.. We were taken to the port for our ferry by the father.. We enjoyed our stay so much we are booked in for our last night next week.. Looking forward to being pampered by them all once again..,0
"Ah, if I could go right back to a place today it would be Damianos (and it has only one day since I left). From the moment you are picked up at the airport you feel like home, people there are very polite and funny. The pool is amazing, the view of the sunset is not from this world, pricing was very good, bedrooms are clean, new, just like they got out of an interiors design magazine. Of course you have to go down lots of steps to get to Chora, but is always worth it. Wifi signal was poor for streaming, but who cares when you have so much to do in Mykonos?!? Thank you, Daminos staff, you made this journey even better!",0
Great location with a spectacular view. The staff were very accommodating and always happy to help and assisted us when a strike cancelled our ferry. Overall a beautiful family run hotel. Highly recommended!,0
"This little secret is only for does that want to spend the best possible holidays. In a few words, Just Perfect.The location is nice, the rooms are perfect, the host is the best possible to find, breakfast is top. Nothing more I can say will present the real truth. Just go!   Room Tip: Good Views; 500m from town; relaxing; best staf; 5Stars See more room tips",0
"We stayed at the Damianos in September 2015. We were picked up from the airport by the owner who was very friendly. When we arrived at the airport we were shown to our room. We stayed in one of the budget rooms as we booked last minute and this was all they had left without having to change rooms every few days. It was all you needed. There is so much to do on the island. Sitting in your room is he last thing you want to do. The hotel manager was very accommodating. A few days in our air conditioner started leaking and got some of my clothes wet. Once reported it was fixed within a couple of hours. They even offered to get my clothes washed and dried to make up for the inconvenience. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. It's value for money. Close enough to town, but far enough away that it's peaceful and quite.",0
"Our holiday to Mykonos was our first family holiday with our little boy aged 6 months! I didn't know what to expect but coming here was the best decision we ever made. To start the Greeks love children and the staff inparticular at Damianos were absolutely amazing with us, our needs with a new baby and more so with our son, they came and picked him up and played with him every single day, they couldn't do enough to facilitate our stay to the point they even dropped us off into the town with the pushchair on numerous occasions to save us having to walk, all of which they offered as part of what they called ""hotel service"".I've never experienced Customer service to this degree, we felt like VIPS every day and considering how competitively priced the hotel was it far surpassed any of my expectations.The hotel itself is small and perfectly formed. The views are beautiful, the sunset is the best we saw on the whole island, drinks prices the cheapest we found (3 Euros for a beer) and the breakfast was fantastic.The rooms were modern, clean, extremely well kept and the bathroom was probably the best I've ever had in Greece, shower was walk in with lots of space and a monsoon shower.Location wise the hotel is quite a walk from the main town and there are lots of steps, but views like this don't come at sea level. Obviously as long as you're aware of this you won't have any problems.Pool and communal areas, sunbeds etc are perfectly kept, clean and pristine.An exceptional hotel with excellent staff and a fantastic vibe, I'd return in a heartbeat",1
"We travelled to Mykonos in July 2015 with a group for a friends wedding. We all stayed at Damianos hotel and had the best time! We were picked up by the owner and taken to the the hotel when we arrived in Mykonos.Firstly, the friendliness of all the staff was so warming - we felt right at home. We were so well looked after in every regards i.e. breakfast, room service, hiring of quad bikes and cleanliness of the hotel.overall, when we return to Mykonos we will be staying at Damianos again no doubt.",0
"Travelled in May 2013... One of our most memorable stays in Greece, we were picked up from the Airport and brought to the beautiful Damianos Hotel, perched on top of a small hill and providing a lovely view of the Aegean sea. The rooms were clean and spacious with a terrace right outside, a wonderful place to relax at the end of the day. Breakfast (included) was wholesome. The hotel grounds and outdoor pool with colored lights were tastefully decorated and perfect to lounge in. One had to walk down some steep steps to get down to town and the way back was easy by a cab ride. We were dropped off at the Airport at the end of our stay.   Room Tip: Stayed in standard double room with partial sea view...photos attached. See more room tips",1
"I have been in Damianos hotel twice and the last time was in august. I was with some friends of mine and I think that hotel is one of the best deal in Mykonos. Rooms are really nice and clean, everybody are kind and available! There is also a beutifull swimming pool with a great view on the the harbor!!! Breakfast is acceptable.",0
"Thank you very much to all friendly staff. They pick-up us and drop-off to mykonos port.Great location, good breakfast service, nice pool, big and clean bedroom and really nice sunset view from the hotel.We come back sure. 100% recommend.Good Price",0
"We recently returned from a 5 day trip to Mykonos. We were greeted by Helen at the airport with a wonderful hug and kiss. What a start and warm welcome to our holiday.My 2 daughters and myself shared a triple room which was excellent. The food was fantastic, all freshly cooked. All thanks to the staff who were kind, efficient and extremely friendly. The taxi down to the port or back up cost 5 euro's. We did an excellent trip to the Island of Delos which was booked directly at the port and cost 20 euro's. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel which takes you to the beach for 2 euro's. There are some steps you can take across the road from the hotel which takes you directly to the wonderful town. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel other than you would be mad not to try it yourself.   Room Tip: Room 22 noisy, triple room 30 fab. See more room tips",0
"I can't say enough about this hotel. Eleni and her son Thansi could not have been better hosts. We were picked up from the ferry and taken back to the ferry when it was time to go. Our room was spotless the bathrooms exceptionally clean we had a sitting area outside which was beautiful. The hotel is located up on the small hill overlooking town, the glorious sunsets from the taverna are not to be missed. The local bus goes right by the front of the hotel to take you to the many beautiful beaches in Mykonos. The hotel provides a wonderful breakfast to satisfy any pallet. The Wi-Fi works great. The pool was beautiful relaxing and clean. I was not planning to ever return back to Mykonos there are many other places to see in the world but because of Eleni and her son we would love to return again sometime in the near future. Thank you both for a great vacation.",0
My son and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this fantastic very modern family run hotel and everything was first class especially the hospitality .Helen the owner picked us up from the ferry port and we were taken to our beautiful room as we had arrived at 930pm we decided to have dinner at the hotel and was not disappointed the food was excellent !! After dinner Thanos the general manager engaged in conversion with us and bought us shots again a lovely gesture !! The following day Helen was very friendly making sure that everything was to our satisfaction and Thanos gave us useful information about the local bus service Sadly the day after we had to leave and Thanos was kind to take us to the airport do not hesitate to book this hotel I have worked in hospitality for over 30 years and like to stay in 5 star hotels but I was extremely impressed with this hotel and would certainly return again .Thanks to you all for your kindness in making us feel very special !! I know that your season is coming to an end and after a very busy season I hope you all have a well deserved rest !!Until we meet again I wish you all the best .Kindest Regards Kate and Michael Slater .,3
"To the team at Damianos, If I had to say anything about this Hotel, it would be 'Fffffing amazing SERVICE!!' Couldn't do enough to make our stay fantastic.... Good value for money, a proper shower, great sea views. Thank you for everything!!",0
"Seriously amazing! The staff were so attentive. Incredibly clean rooms. Fresh towels each day. Towels for the beach or pool provided. The best breakfast I've had in my six weeks of travel, including bacon and eggs. Very friendly and helpful staff. Quiet at night. I'm a happy girl :)",0
"Loved my stay here. Not only was the location amazing, the hotel was beautiful but the staff were the most helpful staff in all of Europe.I said in many hotels over the past 3 months, but nothing compares to Damianos Hotel.The staff picked us up from the port when we arrived and dropped us to the airport when we left.They helped us with all our questions about Mykonos and where to go and what buses to catch.Their restaurant is amazing!",0
"You will not get the Greek hospitality anywhere else in Mykonos like you get from Thanos and his team at the Damianos Hotel. From the second he picked us up from the port to the second we were dropped off, they were 100% attentive to everything. I am not one to rave about service, bu this is an example of going above and beyond. The location is probably a 4/5 and you have to walk down some steps to get to the main town, but it's a beautiful walk and being up on the hill offers some nice views. The pool is nice and the food from the restaurant very good as well. The rooms were kept very clean and the beds were comfortable. They left a bottle of wine on our bed since we were there during my wife's birthday. Everything about this stay was perfect except for all of the stairs you have to climb coming back from town. If you are feeling lazy, you can catch a cab back up for $5 so it's not bad at all. Couldn't say better things about these people and service though.",1
We would like to thank Attanasio and his mother for their kindness and their attention and care for usThey have a perfect hotel (very clean and comfortable rooms) and a very good staff...beautiful Giorgia....our holidays will be always there...ciao Luca e Luigi,0
"We stayed in Damianos for three nights this October and the experience was wonderful. This is a family run hotel and the service is awesome, they are always attentive and friendly, they offer complementary transfer from and to the port. The hotel is located on a little hill in Mykonos Town with good views of the town and the sea. The swimming pool and other areas are nicely decorated which gives the hotel an upscale feeling. For breakfast, you have plenty of choice from greek yogurt, omlettes, bacon, melon, pastries, bread, coffe... There are two buses that stop in front of the Hotel, that you can take to go to two different beaches. We took one of these buses to go to Elia Beach, which was really nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",0
"I just stayed at Damianos and I'm sure that was the best place that I could had chosen! At first, my boyfriend and I had a good ""first impression"" when the owner of Damianos went pick up us at the airport. He gave us some tips about the town. Then we met a friendly woman in reception that made our check in and showed us a map of the island and also taught us how to go for every landscape. The room are extremely clean, comfortable and functional. The view is fantastic. We really enjoyed the breakfast, although being simple and with few options everything is very tasty. The location is excellent!",0
"This hotel deserves something more than a rating of 5, it's simply perfect. The service level couldn't be any higher, the hotel restaurant is well priced and delicious, the rooms are beautiful, the pool is gorgeous, it has an amazing view over the town/ocean/sunset, and the location is very convenient. Would stay for months if I could.",0
"We visited Mykonos as part of a gay tour of Greece and couldn't help but be enchanted with the hospitality and care the staff of Damianos provided across the board: orienting us around town, checking in with us continuously to ensure we were enjoying our stay. The rooms are lovely and well equipped and the hotel has so many outdoor gone ring spaces to sip wine and watch the sunset. Their restaurant offers great quality food at a fraction of the cost of most places in town. It was heartbreaking to leave.",0
"on arriving on Mykonos the hotel collected us from the airport, the hotel is beautiful, the bedrooms are very comfortable, with crisp white sheets. Even better is the care and attention paid to making your stay at the hotel the best it possibly could be. The staff are friendly and attentive. They even made sure that we arrived at the port to catch our ferry at exactly the right time. Thank you for making our stay such a lovely experience.   Room Tip: Make sure to allow time to have leisurely breakfast and watch the sunset from the terrace See more room tips",0
"I recently returned from Mykonos and the Damianos Hotel. It was just wonderful. The rooms were roomy, clean and the beds easy to sleep on. The view from the hotel is beautiful. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and an added bonus. We had dinner at the hotel one night and the food was above our expectation! The staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. A special shout out to Georgia. Straight Up!",0
"Thanos, the manager, and the rest of the staff went out of their way to make our stay perfect. The room was extremely comfortable, the pool sparkling. The whole place was spotlessly clean.We missed our ferry going onward but other accommodation was promptly found for us nearby, we were dropped off near town to arrange other ferry tickets and phone calls made on our behalf. They were so helpful when we needed urgent help.   Room Tip: Room 27 had a terrace with sea views. See more room tips",1
"This was a lovely stay in mykonos town. The website says 2 stars but you are treated better than ever expected. Clean room and pool was beautiful with a view of the whole town. Continental breakfast was well put together. Amazing time and this is an amazing deal. If you are allergic to cats, there were some kittens running around outside, but that is pretty much all of the town.",0
Staff was fantastic and made us feel welcomed and at home. They were more than accommodating. The food was authentic and delicious! It was a bit of a walk to the main town but it wasn't horrible at all. Bus station was very close and easily accessible. Great stay overall and would definitely recommend to others.,0
"This is my 4th year in a row in this family owned hotel and every time I stay at Damianos they surpass my expectations and I feel more and more welcomed and at home! The location is wonderful-in the centre of Mykonos, yet quiet since it is situated on a hill above the most central wind mill.Excellent higene, most delicios breakfast, view to die for and great pool!I strongly reccomend this excellent hotel!",0
"Great accommodation, they have great staff, a great pool, clean rooms etc etc. The only downfall is the location. There's one heck of a steep walk to and from the town, so be prepared for that if you plan ongoing to and from the hotel regularly.",0
"Especially for the price! Damianos was modern, clean, and well appointed. The rooms arent fancy, but more than satisfactory, particularly for a 1.5 star. The pool area is lovely - many days started with a swim and sunbathe. The friendly and super-attentive (but not at all intrusive) service is what really sets it apart though... They are building their business based on ensuring you have the best possible stay, and it really shows. Only thing to flag is that the walk is steep to the main town - so the walk back can be tiring, and not ideal for the less able - but otherwise is 5/5 in every respect. Highly recommended.",0
"This family run hotel is fantastic! Helen, owner of the hotel for many years, Thanos her son and Georgia are sensational. The rooms are simple and very clean. There is a great pool where we spent many days laying around. The location is also great. It's a short walk down the hill into Mykonos town (the walk back can be a bit tough) and there is a grocery store just around the corner. A bus also stops at the front of the hotel and goes directly to Elia Beach.A few things that made this hotel so outstanding: 1. I asked Helen where the local pharmacy was. It was a very hot day. She wouldn't tell me and instead insisted on driving me to it. I don't know any hotel owner that would do that. 2. On our last night the hotel put on a party for us. We paid a small fee and they provided us with food, Greek dancing and plenty of laughs. All the hotel staff came. 3. Drinks watching the sun set. Because the hotel location is on the hill above the town centre, every night we were treated to a magic sunset. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Mykonos!",0
"I stayed there 7 days/6 nights in August 15 with 20s of us from Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.It was a family owns hotel and I was treated as part of their families.Staff and Customer Service - The best of the best!!I was greeted by a handsome Greek man, Thanos at the port and transferred to the hotel. The receptionist greeted us while we were checking in and gave us lot of recommendations in Mykonos e.g. restaurants and all the highlights which were very helpful. The waiter, Georgia - She was an amazing lady, friendly and funny. Room- It was quiet, luxurious and clean. The windows were built by double glazed glasses even my room was right in front of the swimming pool. Strong air-conditioner in room.Facilities - Descent size and beautiful swimming pool with strong and lovely beach chairs at both sides. The swimming pool was clean and changed colours at night - very beautiful. Wifi was strong, free and accessed anyway within the hotel. Restaurant - The restaurant had indoor and outdoor areas. Breakfast was free and lot of varieties. We had lunches and dinners there. The food was great and the price was reasonable. Tried their club sandwiches - It was yummy. Strawberry smoothies was fresh made and perfect in 36 degrees and lots of strawberries. The food came quick even we had 25 of us ordered at the same time. Room - I stayed at room 17. It was luxurious, quiet and clean. The windows were built by double glazed. We couldn't hear any noise even our room was located in front of swimming pool. Helen and Thaos organised us a traditional Greek dinner with traditional Greek dance for our last night. We dance with them just like friends and families.Location - The hotel was located up at the hill. It was just 10-mins walk to the town - very handy. Excellent sunset view from the hotel.Everything was perfect there. We will definite stay there again.",0
My mate and I travelled to Mykonos a day earlier than scheduled and booked this hotel last minute for one night. Damianos is a wonderful place to stay and extremely comfortable everyone that worked there went well out of their way to make our stay enjoyable! Including dropping us off to our next hotel on departure. Very affordable price I definitely recommend you stay here.,0
"This was the first hotel on our trip consisting of 3 nights in Mykonos followed by 6 nights in Santorini. Was expecting Santorini to be the best part after a quick stop in Mykonos but it turned out to be the other way round after my fiance proposed to me at the hotel on the first night! It wasn't just this that made the hotel amazing - it was just wonderful to begin with. The multicoloured pool, along with the amazing view & sunsets every night made it fantastic. Breakfast was great, room was comfortable. Had tea there one night and the food was very good. Staff were very pleasant & the owner even picked us up from the airport & then dropped us off at the port for our boat to Santorini. Couldn't have asked for better! Would definitely come back.",0
"Cannot recommend this place more highly!We stayed in Damianos for eight nights. From pick up at the port to Thanos' extensive run through of key Mykonos information on arrival to the cleanliness of the hotel to the food served from the kitchen - Damianos is all you need. The location is perfect - a short stroll down the steps to the buzz of the town, buses to Elia and Paradise Beach from outside etc. The breakfast is so tasty - scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meats & cheese, fresh fruit & yoghurt, cake & croissants. And the view from the breakfast room and the pool is amazing!!All in all I don't know why you would stay anywhere else...",0
"At this hotel you will only find friendly atmosphere and people willing to help you in anything you need. The hotel is very cute and covers most of your needs. It is also very clean and the rooms are very nice and look recently renovated. As I mentioned the service is excellent and we felt very welcome all the time. They offer transportation from and to the airport or port which is excellent and we really thank them for that. Also if you are renting a car ( you need to in Mykonos as there are nearly no taxis available) the hotel is situated close to a main road that leads you to all the other main roads so you can easily go round the island. There is also adequate parking space. If you want to walk to the town it's just a 10 minute walk bow hill, but you must be prepared to climb it up again. A bit of an exercise but exercise is always good for us!! In general we had a lovely stay and we will be definitely returning when we visit Mykonos again.",1
"Damianos Hotel was so warm and welcoming. The rooms were immaculate and the staff was great. Georgia, the bartender/waitress was great. She was always smiling and so accommodating. I enjoyed just sitting out on the patio watching the view and sunset. And sitting out by the pool was so relaxing.   Room Tip: Rooms on the higher floor near the sun beds are great! See more room tips",0
The hotel staff here are all amazing. My partner and I stayed here fro three nights in July. We picked up form ferry port and brought back to airport free of charge. The pool is nice and peaceful and is just a five minute walk into town. Every single member of staff were so helpful and friendly.,0
"My wife, myself and 3 friends stayed at the Damianos for 7 nights as part of my extended 50th birthday celebrations. The actual hotel premises are as the photos describe. The rooms are impeccably clean, good size and functional with everything that you need inside. The pool area is a wonderful oasis where you can have a swim, work on you tan, relax with a drink, listen to the cool music and watch the amazing sunset from your pool chair and engage with fellow holiday makers. The breakfast selection was amazing but better still was the terrace area overlooking Mykonos town and the ocean where you eat your morning delights. The yogurt and honey is sublime. But in my opinion what makes the Damianos the best hotel stay ever, was the hospitality shown by the owner Thanos, his mother Helen and the rest of his team. From the time Helen was there to greet us at the airport, the welcoming cocktails provided by Georgia, the endless warmth, enthusiasm and helpfulness shown by Thanos to ensure both our stay in this hotel and our holiday in Mykonos was perfect, makes the Damianos a perfect place for a Mykonos holiday. I will definitely be back.",0
"what a lovely place to stay, the staff all excellent and very friendly. We stayed for 3 nights at the start of our island hoping holiday and could have easily stayed for longer. The rooms are very clean and quiet. The views are spectacular both day and night. Well done to all at the Damianos. Dave & Wendy Manchester UK",0
"We have stayed at Damianos Hotel in Mykonos for 4 nights and we have enjoyed our stay. The hotel is small but very clean and staff are friendly. we were offered free pick up from the port as we arrived on the boat which was a nice personal touch. the owners were friendly and explained us everything about sights in Mykonos and where to go. We have rented a car so travelled around the island quite a bit, our favorite beaches were Panormos, Elia and Kalafiti. Paradise beach is overcrowded with youngsters and too commercial and busy. there is free parking at hotel.The pool at the hotel was nice with sun loungers and towels provided. Our room was a bit small but we booked a budget room so that was expected, didn't bother us as we didn't spend much time in the hotel. Breakfast was a bit simple and not much choice but it's not 5 star so was acceptable, if you do want extras staff were preparing it at extra charge. It is about 15 minutes walk to Mykonos town on foot through quite a lot of steps, so if you can not walk a lot, it's better to get a taxi. We didn't mind, it was particularly good on the way back to hotel after those big Greek dinners we had!Overall good value hotel and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to explore Mykonos.",0
"We spent a week at the hotel in August and it's hard to know where to start. We had a family room very close to the bar and restaurant. The room was an excellent size with a plentiful supply of toiletries in the bathroom which had a bath with a shower attachment. Despite being so close to the restaurant / bar we were never disturbed by noise which gave me the impression that it was a really designed / constructed building. The housekeeping was superb. The room was cleaned to a very high standard every day. The pool area was great (the pool itself being salt water). There was never a shortage of sunbeds and there were a number of double beds around the pool. Pool / beach towels were provided free of charge. As other reviewers have commented breakfasts were fabulous - with an excellent cold and hot buffet. We were half board and could choose from the menu (which the kids loved as they aren't keen on the buffet style dinners which many hotels serve). A word of warning about the food. Portions are large. Starters were more like mains and can even come with chips, Mains were even bigger which made three courses something of a challenge. The hotel is about 5 minutes for the beach, which was very well serviced but to my mind was a bit too crowded (and you need to get there early to guarantee a sunbed). It was also about 5 minutes from a few shops / bakeries etc (although I wouldn't really call it a town and the traffic was horrendous in that area). Another plus about the hotel though was that I barely remember hearing a car whilst we were there, Very easy to get into Mykonos town on the bus which is worth a visit. To save the best until last though the waiting and bar staff were exceptional. So friendly and customer focussed, They were a real credit to the hotel which I would recommend to anyone.",0
"We stayed at Yiannaki for 3 nights in Mykonos. Ornos is a great place to stay for a few good reasons.1) Ornos beach has sand on the beach and in the water (at least the first few meters)2) It can be WINDY in Mikonos but somehow Ornos beach is sheltered.3) Lots of eating places on or near the beach.4) A few good bakeries and markets around for water, sundries, etc.5) 10 minutes by bus to Mykonos Town.Mikonos Town is a party / touristy place which is VERY crowded at night.Ornos is a happy medium of late night places to relax / eat compared to Mykonos Town. And if you want to head into town, it only costs 1.80 Euro each way and 15 minutes to get to Mykonos Town from Ornos.So what does this have to do with Yiannaki hotel?Yiannaki hotel is a 10 minute walk from Ornos beach. Ornos beach is VERY crowded and you probably need a reservation for the umbrella / lounge chairs on the beach.Or, you can skip the crowd and stay at the pool at Yiannaki hotel. The pool is large and is salt water. In fact, it is even the same temperature as the water at Ornos beach.The staff (especially two people at the reception desk (Vicky? and the one who appeared to be the manager) and the girl who tends bar at the pool are VERY helpful and friendly. They will go out of their way make your stay enjoyable.The breakfast is included and is solid (8AM till 11AM). You get bacon, eggs, over-easy eggs, Florentine scrabled eggs, ham, eggs, pastries, bread, etc.We had a room NOT overlooking the pool which was great. The restaurant and pool are on the same side so if people are eating late, the back rooms are nice and private.You should know that WALKING to Ornos beach can be a hairy affair. There is no side walk and the drivers are a bit crazy in Mykonos.A free shuttle to and from the port is included and THIS IS REALLY important. Getting a cab arriving by ferry is probably NOT going to work for you. A hotel shuttle is a MUST.I would stay at this hotel again for sure.   Room Tip: 300s and 400s are NOT facing the pool. 100s and 200s face the pool See more room tips",1
"We stayed in this hotel for two nights and we appreciate how friendly the staff was. I was not feeling well as I had something terrible at our previous stay, and the hotel staff arranged an appointment and transfer to the doctors. The staff in the kitchen was nice enough to offer soup since I was in complete lost of appetite for the day. Once feeling better my husband and I walked to Ornos beach and had an amazing time there. Market, bus stop walking distance (around 5 mins) from hotel. Thank you guys so much for an amazing time.",1
"On our way to the port after checking out from the hotel. Lovely hotel with good service. Within a ten minute walk to Ornos beach. Quite crowded and popular but great for kids because there's no waves whatsoever. But windy but it's a large bay so no surf at all.The hotel itself has a nice setup. Good internet connection, nice pool though a bit windy to enjoy for long. Great breakfast and excellent pickup drop off service in a luxury minibus. Very nice staff. Had lunch one day and the pizza and bruschetta were good. Very reasonably priced drinks and minions in my opinion. Bus goes from the bag our town center into Fabrika in Mykonos town for just 1.80 Euro port person. Every half hour, very convenient.Room was nice with a tub and hands shower, full set of toiletries. Small balcony overlooking the pool.",0
"Yiannaki Hotel is a stunning gem on Mykonos Island. We stayed here a few weeks ago, for 5nights.The staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself if perfectly located near the beach and has it's own lovely pool. The food at the restaurant is excellent and well priced. I am very particular about room cleanliness and I couldn't fault theirs. The breakfast(which is included) was lovely, plenty of variety and very fresh.Overall I highly recommend staying here - you can tell the owner takes immense pride in the upkeep of the property. Beautiful getaway on a beautiful island.",0
"We stayed here as a couple for 3 nights in Aug 2016. It was ok, but really nothing special. Room was v basic. Fridge made a loud banging noise at night which kept waking us and fuse box was also making a funny noise. Breakfast was very average, a bit disappointing even. Location was ok but not great. Overall booked this last minute and at £225/night was cheap for Mykonos so I guess u get what U pay for. Wouldn't come back.",0
"This place truly cares about customer service. From the ferry pickup to the front desk staff, to the porter and cleaning ladies, this place went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic. The front desk was so helpful and informative and arranged reservations, taxis, car rentals, gave directions and recommendations that all turned out excellently. Our room was downstairs by the gym. I used the gym a couple times. It's not fancy, but all I needed was mat room for some yoga so it worked out for me. The sauna is nice, but I never used it. Our room was on the smaller side, but clean and neat. The balcony was awesome. Beautiful views. Pro tip! At night be sure to close the shutters tight because Mykonos can be windy and to hear a thump thump of a shutter banging in the wind is very distracting when trying to sleep. Also the sun rises above the pool so if the shutters aren't closed, be ready to wake with the sun! The location of this hotel was awesome. About 10 minute walk from Ornos beach. We went there a couple times and although we did go to some other beaches on Mykonos, I could have gone to Ornos every day. The hotel was very comfortable, not just with amenities, but the attitude of the staff and the whole vibe of the place makes you feel 100% at home. 10/10 would stay again.",0
"I stayed here for two nights in July on business. My flight was delayed and didn't land until 1.30am but the hotel still sorted out a transfers for (note - if you've never been to Mykonos - ask for hotel for transfers in advance as there are hardly any taxis on the island).The staff were lovely and friendly and would go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. It's not as luxurious as I thought it would be for a 4* hotel but had everything you'd need. Lovely pool, a short walk to the gorgeous Ornos beach and big spacious rooms. I wish I could've stayed for longer to really sample the good service and gorgeous location.",0
"Could not recommend Yiannaki hotel enough! The hotel is comfortable but it really is the staff that make all the difference. The hotel offers complimentary airport transfers and when we arrived at Mykonos airport we were met by Yianni, the hotel owner. Yianni was friendly and helpful (even doing a detour via the shop on the way to the hotel so my friend could get cigarettes ). When we arrived at the hotel the staff at reception were extremely helpful and offered a lot of local knowledge and suggestions of places to visit all over the island.The food at the hotel restaurant was also some of the best we ate on the island & the staff were friendly and attentive. The pool & restaurant area is nice and quiet and relaxing. Most nights we had drinks at the pool bar while chatting with Yianni and the fabulous restaurant staff Effie & Christina. The hotel is a 5 minute max walk to Ornos beach (the person who said 10 minutes must have been walking a very long way around!!). There is a bus stop right at the end of the street that goes into Mykonos Town and takes approx 10minutes. The rooms themselves are clean, quiet and spacious. Good quality bedding and plenty of storage. Only minor criticism would be that the minibar/coffee station wasn't restocked daily. Overall we had a fantastic stay and would most definitely stay again next time we visit Mykonos. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for contributing to our amazing holiday!",0
"We could not appreciate the staff more as they gave us the warmest welcome upon our arrival and continued to impress us with their knowledge of the island and recommendations for dinner. The room was very clean and the pool area was beautiful!! The breakfast spread surpassed our expectations offering a variety of eggs, fresh pastries, fruit, yogurt etc. Additionally the food at the hotel was exceptional and served food all day around the pool which was a nice quiet relaxing atmosphere! Ornos beach was a 5 minute walk from our hotel that is usually very crowded but has several restaurants right on the beach. We would definitely return in the future and highly recommend Yiannaki that provided us with a wonderful experience in Mykonos!",0
Had a great time. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very clean and well furnished. Food in the hotel's restaurant was very tasty and reasonably priced. Great location away from noise and crowd.,0
From the second we landed to the moment we departd we were treated exceptionally well. The staff were very mannerly and couldnt do enought for us. The room was spacious and airy and had all the amenities we required. excellent place to stay.   Room Tip: all rooms we seen were great. See more room tips,0
"Very good hotel with nothing too much trouble for the wonderful staff. Not in the heart of Ornos or near the beach (10 min walk), but the pool made up for this! Good onsite restaurant. Excellent Wi-Fi connection in the room and around the pool.",0
"First trip to Mykonos! This hotel near Ornos Beach was very comfortable, and modern, parking and nice breakfast and with a beautiful salt water pool. I only say 4* because it is not right on the beach it's a little walk down a path, for comfort 5*Great to stay in Ornos! We had a car, but it looks like the bus from Mykonos town comes through Ornos and then goes on to Platis Gialos beautiful beach with a nice restaurant Avli where we got a chairAnd there is the kite beach nearby. And we drove to Agios Ioannis beach too, had to pay for a chair but very nice.",0
"Yiannaki hotel is a hidden gem! Such a great value for an amazing hotel! Clean rooms, great food, very helpful staff, beautiful facilities, and an amazing location and such a great value! I felt that I really got my money's worth at this hotel! Will definitely be returning",0
"We stayed at this lovely hotel in June of this year, the whole experience was fantastic. The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning was a god send due to the 25C temperatures at night!The restaurant served mainly traditional greek food which was better than anything we found in Ornos. But the best thing of all was the service, with special mention to Christina and Effie who made our stay truly memorable. We will certainly be going back.",0
"Highly recommended for single, couple or family with children. Great staff, service oriented and very clean property,Location is very convenient. 5 min walking to Ornos beach and 5 min on quad bike to town.",1
"My wife and I originally recommended this hotel to our daughter who was planning her first solo vacation this year following her A-Levels. In the end, she opted for Skiathos and so we decided to take up the opportunity of 8 days away to re-charge the batteries before we travel to South Africa in August. What we really liked about this hotel is the fact that it is literally 10 minutes from Mykonos Airport and so following an early morning flight from Gatwick we were literally 30 minutes through airport immigration, private taxi to the hotel, checked in and enjoying our first cold beer by the pool. The hotel is a friendly, family-run establishment 5 minutes from Ornos Beach and 5 minutes from Ornos centre where you can catch the bus in to Mykonos Town within 10 minutes. The hotel sits on the side of a hill and is subject to some fairly strong winds, which we found to be a wonderful reprieve from the sun. Because of the winds many of the hotel guests tend to go to the beach for the day meaning that there is no frenzy around reserving sun beds with towels and, in fact, on one day we had the pool area entirely to ourselves! This setting was ideal for us as we really wanted peace and quiet to relax which we got in an abundance. Later in the day the pool area tends to get busier and it was nice to sit out until well in to the evenings have a drink before getting ready to go out for dinner. The rooms are clean, comfortable, modern and well decorated with excellent air conditioning. House-keeping is spot-on with our room being cleaned daily every day whilst at breakfast without fail. The reception staff are always cheerful, friendly and there to attend to your needs - equally, they just let you get on with what you want to do if that's your preference. The hotel restaurant offered some of the nicest food we had on holiday at prices below what you would pay on Ornos beach with a great menu selection that I'm sure would cater for everyone's taste. We have awarded this hotel 5-rating because it ticked all the boxes for us with no complaints. I believe it is a 4-star hotel and this feels right for Greece. We came away for a relaxing break and that is exactly what this hotel delivered. Mykonos itself is seriously over-priced against other Greek and Mediterranean resorts but at c. £100 a night for a double room you cannot fault the Yiannaki Hotel, which offers value for money delivered with a smile in a good location providing a great blend of relaxation versus accessibility to the wilder side of Mykonos should you so desire. Breakfast provided up to 11am is an added bonus meaning you do not need to get up at the crack of dawn and hotel guest are international from across the globe including Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. If you are planning to get the bus in to Mykonos Town get to the stop 15 minutes early and wait 10-15 north of the bus stop as the stop in Ornos centre is the last on route and it's a bit of a frenzy when the bus arrives given it is almost full by the time it hits this last stop. We stayed in room 108 with a nice balcony overlooking the pool. We avoided booking a car, scooter or quad bike (there are some crazy people on the roads; great to watch the madness, not so good to be part of it!) and found it easy enough to navigate our holiday walking and via the bus. This also helped de-stress the holiday and in no way proved an obstacle - we travelled most evenings in to Mykonos Town without issue or delay albeit the bus is cosy. Great holiday, great hotel, ticked all our boxes - fully refreshed! Finally, WiFi is generally good all around the hotel; we Skype'd our daughter nightly with reasonably good quality and reliability.   Room Tip: We stayed in 108 and we very happy with our room overlooking the pool area. See more room tips",1
"We stayed at Yiannaki the first week of July 2016. The hotel was always impeccably clean. The waiting staff Katerina, Effi and Christina were great and the reception staff really helped to make our holiday - Vicki, Stavroula and Eleni, they were always so welcoming and helpful, great customer service, other places could learn a thing or two from this team. Breakfast was fine, could be a little more adventurous or certainly change slightly day to day but lunch and dinner menu and food was good. Would definitely recommend staying here as close to the bus stop with easy access into Mykonos town, beach and central location.",1
The staff was very friendly and helpful with our travel plans. The room was clean and breakfast by the pool was relaxing. The beach was a short walk from the hotel but the family friendly location was beautiful.,1
"Couldn't fault anything about Yiannaki – it more than lived up to our expectations. Clean, comfortable, welcoming, friendly. In fact, spending a day by the pool with a snack and a drink was more enjoyable than going to the beach, which is fun but noisy and crowded at this time of year. What makes Yiannaki special, apart from the excellent food, is the attention of the owner, Yiannis, who treats everyone with warmth and humour, and all his staff, particularly Effie and Katarina whose service with a smile, day and night, was unbelievable. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: All rooms look out over pool and have small balconies See more room tips",1
"Great place to avoid the major partying that Mykonos is famous for. Easy, relaxing stay, gorgeous pool, extra helpful friendly staff, really nice restaurant onsite, pool bar us super fun, sun beds and chairs are sooo comfy. Walk to two beaches and the bus is easy. Clean, happy place!   Room Tip: It's prettier from the pool side with great terraces for every room See more room tips",1
"The Yianniki Hotel provided a friendly welcome and attentive to our needs. The room was simple and spotless with a little balcony for drying bikinis overnight. We had brekkie and late night drinks by the pool and bar every day. Ornos beach has inexpensive sunbed sets - 2 beds and a shade for about 15 euros - some other beaches were 100 euros! Daily coffee/drinks/food service at the beds. There are about 6 - 8 restaurants along the beach front (some attached to hotels at the back) - all welcoming and open to passing trade. The food was fabulous - we chose fresh...fish, Greek dips, fig salad, burrata/mozarella salads - SO delicious. Prosecco 24 euros a bottle (Mykonos Town charged 80 euros!!). There's a couple of stylish boutiques, a supermarket up the back street, boat tours daily in a little wooden boat. So it's a smart bohemian, easy way of life - NOT a big, loud-music party spot. The frequent bus takes you to other beaches and to Mykonos Town. A limited taxi service can be called to get to other local resorts. A complete mix of people from all ages but not over-run by families only or romantic couples only - it was a true mix of ALL ages. We would go here again and recommend it. We were two girlfriends - English and Aussie - late 40s/early 50s.   Room Tip: ask for a balcony See more room tips",0
"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel! The staff was exceptional. Very friendly. Our room was great! Big room, air conditioning. Very clean. The restaurant served amazing food. Paradise! The hotel owner was always very friendly. Overall this hotel was GREAT! Highly recommend.",1
"This is one of our favourite hotels. We have been visiting the Yiannaki for many years and have watched it develop year by year. It is such a relaxing environment - the rooms have always been spotless; the restaurant is wonderful - the choice of food is excellent with traditional Greek cooking and some more modern dishes. The Pizzas are superb. If you want a quiet relaxing dinner away from the noise and fumes of Ornos then try the Yiannaki. I think you do ""come as guests and leave as friends"" - that is our experience over the years. All the staff are helpful and do all they can to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Finding the Yiannaki in 2002 was pure serendipity. On an island where the costs are creeping up year by year, this hotel is excellent value for money.   Room Tip: We like the quiet rooms that don't overlook the pool area See more room tips",3
"A perfect holiday in every respect, very good food , cooked fresh hotel , impeccable service ! Swimming pool with sea water, comfortable lounges , wi -fi everywhere, in a word perfection = Yiannaki !! Ornos beach is very near, only 10 minutes to Mykonos center by bus.",1
"The hotel is a lovely small hotel, where the staff are wonderful and kind and made the stay enjoyable. They are all very approachable and They all take time to talk to you. Everyone you speak to or come across that are visiting the hotel long or short stay have only had good things to say. Which I totally agree with. The food and drinks were also good we stayed in a few times at the hotel and enjoyed it. The location is very close to Ornos beach, and bus stops isn't far to take you to the town or other beaches. They also had a hotel shuttle to pick you and drop you to airport, I had the issue that the shuttle was stuck in traffic and the owner Yanni took his time to get me to the airport or was close to missing my flight due to the traffic on Fridays. I would definitely recommend this hotel and come back. It's true what they say ""you come as a guest and leave as a friend.""",2
"Yiannaki Hotel was very nice. They picked us up from the ferry at the beginning of our trip and then took us to the airport at the end of our stay free of charge.The hotel was very comfortable. The rooms were clean and spacious. There was a nice balcony. The breakfast everyday was very good with a lot of variety. The pool bar/area was nice as well. A very short walk to the beach.I would for sure stay there again. You do need a cab to get to Mykonos Town, that was not a problem on either end.I enjoyed myself very much and would recommend   Room Tip: I did not have this but a pool view would be great See more room tips",2
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in June and really enjoyed it! Our room was comfortable and clean with a terrace overlooking the pool. The pool itself was very refreshing and had a laid back atmosphere. The on site restaurant and pool bar were nice as well. We had our breakfasts at the restaurant in addition to a late lunch, and also enjoyed cocktails by the pool on their chairs and loungers. The hotel also offers a shuttle to/from the airport for 7€ per person. This was also convenient. Hotel reception (and really all employees) were really warm and welcoming. We'd definitely stay here again!",1
"We travelled to Mykonos on May 30, 2016 for a family vacation and to celebrate my birthday. We stayed at the Yiannnaki Hotel on Ornos Beach. Well i cannot tell you enough how amazing our stay was at this hotel. Never in all our travels have we had such amazing customer service. The hotel picked us up from the port with their courtesy van. Check in was very organized and quick. Our rooms were perfect. We all had balconies with amazing views of ocean and mountain. The pool is a great size and the lounge chairs are the most comfortable. Wicker not hard plastic. We walked down to beach but it is quite busy and its so quiet at hotel we decided to just stay at hotel. The hotel has an excellent continental breakfast which was included. The restaurant has an excellent menu. We tried all appetizers and some some than once. We only ate one night away from the hotel wished we didn't. So much better at hotel than at Ornos beach restaurant. The serving staff were the greatest, Katarina, Steph and Effie, hope i remember and spelled them correctly gave personal service and made you feel part of the family. And then there is Yiannis. He is the boss man/owner. Made us feel like we were the only guests there. He set fireworks off for my birthday celebration. No where else have we received such service. The hotel is in a great location, close to shopping and beach but just far enough back so its quiet. Can't say enough about how we loved this hotel. We will be going back.   Room Tip: Great views, lots of stairs so maybe not good for handicap. See more room tips",3
"The people in the hotel were very friendly and customer service was great We had the best holiday, Hotel was clean quiet, food was nice The best thing about this hotel was the friendly staff and great location near ornos beach and centre We will go back for sure Thank you",0
"Stayed here for two weeks whilst attending a family wedding at a nearby hotel. Couldn't fault the place. Beautiful pool area. Lovely rooms. Brilliant restaurant serving quality food. 7 mins walk from the beautiful Ornos beach area which is very swanky. Bus stop to Mykonos town 5 min walk. 1.80 euros each. All The staff are so friendly and helpful. From the ladies on the reception to our maid who was always smiling. Effi, Christina, Katerina worked so hard making sure everything was perfect. Yannis the owner was always about, making sure the smooth running of his hotel. We can't wait to return. Thank you. Our holiday was perfect.",0
"We stayed at this hotel in mid June. We were only at Mykonos for 2 days since we'd heard that it's mostly a party town and we were traveling with kids. This is a great hotel to stay with kids if you want to head there. It's about 3-4km from the main town in Mykonos but still close to the Ornos beach. The rooms are very large (especially compared to most EU hotels). The rooms could use some updating, but certainly were not old. The service was very good (in general, all the staff was very good). The pool was great, very big and varying depth for all ages. They serve drinks there, and the hotel restaurant is right next to it, if you want to grab something to eat. The restaurant is just ok, nothing to rave about, but if you don't want to walk 10-15 minutes to some places to eat, or to into the main town, it's doable. The hotel location is a bit away from the main town, but you can get a taxi for about 10euros one way. We rented a car and that worked out well. There's plenty of parking at the hotel. If you're traveling with family, this is a very good place to stay, I'd stay there again.",1
"My husband and i stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon. Room was large and very clean.Its only a short walk to the beach and to the bus stop that takes you to Mykonos Town (Chora). Tap water is bot drinkable on the island (it won't make you sick but its too salty), they give you one free large bottle when you arrive in your room.You can buy more bottles at the bar or buy them for cheap at a market. They did not mind if you brought your cheap bottles for dinner which was nice. The restaurant had delicious foods at a reasonable price. The pool area was quite large and well kept. There is also a large collection of books in the lobby to borrow from for some poolside reading.The owner and staff were all very hospitable. Great hotel, I highly recommend this place for anyone other than young partiers (you guys can stay at Paradise Beach).",1
"We stayed for two weeks mid June, couldn't fault anything at all. The whole of the hotel,is spotlessly clean, the food is amazing with a wonderful chef. All of the staff in the hotel are lovely and can't do enough for you, have to mention Katerina, Christina and Efi who work in the restaurant and the pool bar they are fantastic, also Stavroula Viki and Eleni in reception they are so helpful, and of course our host Yannis who personally looks after his guests. Would definitely return.",0
"We have now stayed at the Yiannaki Hotel on 3 occasions and it never fails to delight. Those who work there are so kind and considerate especially in their dealings with our daughter, Grace. Effie, Kristina, Stavroula and all the team are so welcoming and kind - they treated us like royalty...and the wonderful thing is that they treat everyone in this way. What a fantastic group of people!The food served by the marvellous chef is as good as ever and you simply couldn't ask for more comfortable, spotlessly clean rooms. We will continue to visit Mykonos as it's a place that's very close to our hearts...likewise, we will continue to stay at the Yiannaki Hotel as it boasts a wonderful location, the friendliest team, great food and we have an excellent experience year after year. See you in 2017! :-)",1
"We booked this hotel after reading what other travellers had said and it did not disappoint.We had come to the island to attend a wedding at another hotel.This hotel must rate as one of the best we have ever had the pleasure to stay in.The hotel is spotless.the food is amazing and I am such a fussy eater but I worked my way around Half of the menu The chef who is a woman should have a michelon star everything we managed to eat was truly delicious I say managed because the portions are huge( (I put on half a stone in weigh).Our friends came for dinner one night and wished they had stayed at this hotel in the first place. The waiting staff are truly wonderful nothing is too much trouble and they work their socks off, specil thanks to Christina, Effi,and Katrina..Breakfast is the usual bacon,egg cereal sfriut ham cheese pastries etc,more than enough to satisfy. The staff on reception are fabulous,warm very welcoming and go over and above to cater for your every need.My husbands glasses had broken and when I asked where the nearest optician was and I think it was Maria( one of the owners) who said she was going into Mykonos town and she would have them fixed, unfortunately it was a Greek hoilday last weekend and the optician was shut but Maria took them the following day back to Mykonos town and had them repaired.and there was no charge. they are such kind and thoughtful peopleThe owners and staff alike are a truly amazing group.Customer srvice personified and the excellent food is a bonus A special thanks also to Vicky on reception who greeted us so warmly when we first arrived.A HUGE thank you to everyone involved during our stay Only downside was Mykonos is not very suitable for people with walking difficulties as it is very hilly lots of steps and no pavements quite hazardous.   Room Tip: facing the pool See more room tips",1
Stayed for 2 nights.Nice rooms with big balcony.... Very neat & CleanWe were greeted by reception staff very well. They also ready to help for any question regarding city.Hotel is near to beach but it will take 5 minute walk.Swimming pool is also good. They will also give beach towels.Lots & lots of variety in breakfast.Great experience. The best thing is behavior of staff.. i was amazed.,1
"This is our third visit to the Yiannaki hotel- my last review was in 2014 and still have the same opinion ; friendly, warm staff, spotlessly clean in all areas,comfortable rooms, gorgeous pool and fantastic restaurant. We went to 3 islands on this trip and our last night meal at the Yiannaki Aleka's restaurant was our favourite in 10 days.I doubt that you could find a team who work harder than these great people.If they're not serving you they are cleaning and tidying , and however busy , they will find time to help.in fact they literally run to avoid keeping you waiting! Thanks to all for your kindness to us. We rarely feel this relaxed - another memorable stay.",1
"The hotel is clean and has a really nice modern look. The location is good as it is only 10 minute bus ride from the town. However a taxi to the town is €10 which adds up if you miss the hourly bus. I travelled to this hotel with my friend (both 21) and found the staff to be quite unfriendly. We did not experience the whole ""come as a guest, leave as a friend"". We found the younger lady on reception to be very dismissive with us and literally looked as if she had a major issue with us throughout our whole stay.We brought an inflatable with us and before blowing it up we asked the reception staff if it would be okay to have it at the pool and they said yes that would be fine. After around 40 minutes blowing it up in the heat, the manager quite abruptly and rude stormed over to us saying ""what is this"" and told us that we were not allowed it at the pool and would have to take it to the beach. I found this to be very odd. Barely anyone even used the pool which is why I didn't understand the issue with us using it.Also the hotel bus is not complimentary, or maybe just not for us as they charged us €14 each. I don't know if it was because we were young that they discriminated against us but I would not recommend this place if you are a young traveller with friends as you will not receive the same treatment as other guests.",0
"Our holiday started off very well when we were collected at the airport by a member of staff. We were greeted by extremely professional reception staff who gave us all the information we needed our stay. The hotel itself was smart, clean and extremely comfortable. The restaurant served great local food and the serving staff were fantastic. It was also very reasonably priced. Location was superb! Only 7 minutes rom the beach where you can find various restaurants and bars. It is also very easy to catch the bus to Mykonos town and all the popular beaches. I would highly recommend Yiannaki hotel, excellent accommodation and amazing staff. We look forward to visiting again very soon.",4
"My wife and I spent 4 nights in the hotel at beginning of June. My wife had broken her knee and was on crutches/wheelchair. The management picked this up from an email I sent them. On arrival they were very attentive and had moved us to a family room by the pool to make her stay easier. We were very impressed.The hotel will collect and return you to the airport in a complementary bus.Restaurant is good quality and pool area is good. 5 minutes to either kite beach or Ornos beach. Room was spacious with a VERY comfortable large bed.Small staff team very friendly and helpful.Plenty of tavernas locally, with strip of well appointed and generally good quality establishments on Ornos beach, although these are not cheap and some tend to pump out loud music.Mykonos town is 5 minutes away by cheap bus",1
"The hotel staff were professional, friendly, eager to help and present at all times. Once introduced to you they remembered your name and made a point of chatting to you about your day and night. The rooms where clean and tidy with aircon, a safe and flat screen tv with plenty of storage for clothing. The bath/shower room was the same and cleaned daily. The location of the hotel was a few minutes walk from Ornos beach which has all you need to relax or party, shop, hire a bike or tan up. Your also 20 minutes walk from the main town Hora or 10 euro taxi fare. Yani, the manager, is probably the friendliest guy you could meet. He would sit with us on an evening (spending more on drinks than we did at one point) and was able to chat to us about where we came from as he has traveled. The food served daily was excellent. We were bed and breakfast so made full use of the brekkie buffet each morning, which was spoilt for choice. I'd go back again and again.",1
A group of friends rented a house in Mykonos and I decided to join last minute. This was the closest hotel to the house and I'm very happy I stayed here rather than the house. The staff was extremely accommodating even to my friends who picked me up occasionally from the hotel. They suggested many places to go for drinks and dinner that were great and not typical tourist spots. Rooms were very cleans. The AC and wifi worked well. Hotel is a 5 minute walk to ornos beach which was really convenient for us. I really liked this place. Would stay again if I every make it back to the island.,1
"We stayed at Yiannaki Hotel just a few weeks ago and it was the start of the busy season in Mykonos. The owner Yanni was one of the best hosts I've ever dealt with. He greeted us with a large glass of Ouzo. The rooms were very nice, our shower did leak and we couldn't figure out why it was leaking. Everything else was awesome. The restaurant at the hotel had some of the best food on the island. Was very impressed with all the food they served. Greek Salad was one of the best I had during my entire trip to Greece. They don't skimp on portion size either. I would definitely stay here again. We booked an excursion from the younger lady at the front desk and it was one of the best excursions I've ever been on. Sailed out to a private location to swim, fish and they fed us homemade meal and free wine and ouzo. superb service.   Room Tip: If you can get a room facing the pool that would be great. See more room tips",1
"I had a wonderful room overlooking the beautiful garden. The room was very spacious and clean. On arrival Stavroula welcomed me and provided me with all the information I needed for a perfect stay. Also Vicky and Eleni are very kind and polite receptionist. The hotel has a nice fitnessroom and the pool area is marvelous. Here you will find a peaceful atmosphere were you can relax and enjoy a excellent saltwater swimmingpool. Everything is well maintained. There are Sunbeds, loungebeds, rockingchairs and lounge seats at the poolbar. Effi and Christina provide your drinks during the day and also serve your lunch and diner at Alekas Restaurant.The restaurant provides excellent food and a great variety in dishes. The portions are big and everything is very fresh prepared by the chef. Which I have to compliment for the excellent dishes, because I almost ate every evening at the restaurant during my 14 day stay at the hotel.The hotel has two hotelbusses who will pick you up and bring you back to Mykonos airport or to the port if you travel to other island. The drivers are very polite and friendly, alswell as the man who takes your suitcases to your room.The distance to the beach is just 5 minutes away. The hotel provides a private path to the road to the beach. There is also the busstop to Mykonos Chora (Town) Every hour there is a busservice to Fabrika (busstation of Mykonos town)The beach has several bars and they provide nice loungebeds, food and drinks.The neighbourhood is also very good for people who like to go for a walk and who like to take beautiful pictures. The island of Mykonos has many mountains, you will find on your way beautiful views from the mountians at the beaches and the see and on your way you will find also many harmless lizards. After my walks I always went back to the Poolbar area at the hotel for a nice talk at the bar.The owner Yiannis is every day at the hotel and in the evening you can find him in the restaurant and poolbar and he is always talking to the guests. He provides a personal touch and makes you extra welcome at the hotel. In fact you feel at home because of the personal service of everybody at the hotel.The hotel slogan is: Where you come as a guest and you leave as a friend.Well ... this is exactly what this hotel is all about. If you love beautiful spacious rooms, excellent food and a personal service. This hotel is the place to be.",2
"This place is very beautiful, has a Beatiful pool and a great restaurant. They go out of their way to make you feel confortable The owner is always making sure that everything is good!! A taxi to town is only like 7 euro or u can take the bus for under 2 euros U r walking distance to a Ornos beach, where u can get free chairs from the restaurants along the beach if u consume. I highly recommend this hotel.",1
"We checked in this morning. The hotel is lovely, the pool is beautiful, the beach is close by. My friends went out in town while I took a nap and when I woke up I got bad news from home. Still needed to eat so I went to their restaurant and the staff was amazing! The owner hugged me. The waitress Effie offered suggestions for comfort food to help me feel better. Amazing people!",1
"Family, friendly hotel where people go over and beyond to make you feel welcoming. This hotel has their own transportation for a very reasonable price. Make sure you call them direct or email them. Also the staff is wonderful. The owner is always there to help you. My mom got sick and they cook special soup which wasn't in the menu and were very helpful. I Highly recommend this hotel, has a beautiful swimming pool, walking distance to the beach and public transportation to Mykonos town.",1
"First visit for myself and daughter, few times for my son. Hotel is beautiful,clean and comfortable, the staff are very welcoming and friendly nothing is a bother for them, owner Yiannis chatted and welcomed everyone a busy man running a hotel ,but had time to speak with his guests and make sure they were alright. Great for relaxing by the pool bar or going into town short distance for pubs and clubs. Hotel restaurant serves good quality food, we ate in restaurant a few times, we did bed and breakfast and there was excellent choices of hot or cold food. An all round fabulous holiday on our way home we were discussing when we could go back. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: From what I could see all rooms look out over the pool and landscape. See more room tips",1
Lovely hotel with all the facilities you could wish for and the friendliest staff ever -special shout out to Vicky on reception and Yiannis the owner . The girls in the restaurant and bar were really great and the hotel food was the best we had in Mykonos . I travelled with my daughter and we had a superb week there -definitely repeatable .Thanks to all at Yiannakis for a great week,1
"I was persuaded to try the Yiannaki Hotel after friends came back from Mykonos the previous year, raving about how great it was. And they were absolutely right! The location, the rooms, the staff - everything is just perfect about this place. The rooms are a real sanctuary, being bright and airy, with lovely balconies (and there are nice views from them on all sides of the hotel it seems). There's air con too, which is very welcome in the hot Cyclades sunshine.The hotel is tucked away in a great quiet spot by Ornos Beach, which is just a short walk away. There are numerous shops and restaurants nearby, but the hotel itself has very good poolside dining - the food is excellent and it was reasonably priced, too.But what really makes the place special is the staff - they go above and beyond all expectations to make you feel at home. Manager Yiannis takes the time to get to know all his guests, and is always on hand if you need anything. And we have to give a special mention to one of the serving staff, Efi, who made all our visits to the restaurant and pool wonderful! They even patiently listened as I practised by broken holiday Greek, despite having perfect English themselves!All in all, I honestly can't say enough great things about the place to do it justice. I'll definitely be back, and - like my friends did - I'll be spreading the word and bringing other newcomers back to see it in future!   Room Tip: Rooms at the back are nice for peace and quiet as they don't overlook the pool (but still have l... See more room tips",3
"After visiting the hotel last year and being totally blown away we decided to visit again and also took a friend. We were treated like old friends on our arrival and everything was just as perfect as I remembered. Hotel is so clean and tidy, rooms are bright and spacious, restaurant food is amazing and the setting is just bliss. But what really makes this hotel are the staff. Without exception they're all so friendly and genuinely keen to make your holiday a pleasure. But special mention must go to Efi who made our evenings in the bar an absolute pleasure (mainly helping my friend practice his Greek!!). Can't wait to go back for a third time.",2
"Second stay here, and look forward to returning. Perfect location, short distance to Ornos beach and only a short taxi or bus trip into Mykonos town. The staff were, as on our first visit, exceptionally friendly, welcoming and helpful too. They all enhanced the holiday to Mykonos, along with the relaxing, comfortable and beautiful hotel itself. Already miss the place!",2
"This is one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. There are great views from all of the rooms. We were on the second floor, and that was ideal. We were able to sleep with our balcony doors open the four nights we were there and it was so relaxing. The food at the pool was superb, as was the included breakfast. The room was comfortable and perfect for our relaxing getaway.Though we were not right on the beach, it was easy to find and within a short walking distance to the hotel. There were plenty of restaurants nearby that made this a great location for a serene day and lively nightlife. Stay at this hotel- you won't regret it!   Room Tip: Ask to be on the second floor or higher with a pool view! See more room tips",2
"Nice quiet hotel… away from Mykonos Town but not to far. The staff was great and was very helpful. It’s close to Ornos beach (walking distance) with many restaurants along the beach.This hotel is great for families and people that really want to relax. The staff was great and was very helpfulThe hotel rooms are a good size but no view.Breakfast was adequate and did offer variety.Wifi was great, Automatically loaded once you got back into the hotel premises",2
"We chose the Yiannaki Hotel based on the advise of our Greek trip planner. What an incredible first impression of the Greek Isles. Our host Yianni was wonderful and made us feel at home. We were traveling with our three adult daughters and they are still talking about it. The hotel was clean, quiet and centrally located to all activities including the beach, the bus to Mykonos Town and all that we wanted to see. Thank you for an incredible trip. We miss you and look forward to our return visit.",1
"It is an amazing hotel in Mykonos with great value for money!!! It combines great accomodation, great breakfast and food, a beautiful pool, where you can swim relax and enjoy your drinks at night. The service is excellent u can feel greek hospitality and warmth. Indeed here you come as a guest and you leave as a friend!!!",2
"Very pleasant hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Good wifi. Lovely breakfasts. Near to a lovely beach with several tavernas. Hotel had its own restaurant which was quite good. Portions needed to be smaller with vegetables or salads included in the price. Beer expensive with no draught beer. Very nice pool and pool area, although pool the coldest I have ever swum in!!   Room Tip: rooms overlooking pool have a good view. See more room tips",0
"Stayed over at Yiannaki Hotel in September 2015, when i visited Mykonos with my family for three days. Even with a small staff the hotel was handled beautifully and one was made to feel at home. The hotel is walking distance from Ornos beach, which is perfect for those of you looking to relax at a shack or even sun bathe. The structure had the signature Greek white washed walls with blue windows and doors, while the interiors were simplistic yet comfortable. The rooms were spacious but didn't offer a great view, be it the rooms with the ""garden view"" or the ""pool view"" which was a little bit of a let down. The bathrooms were quite grand too.The pool, bar and restaurant were all clubbed at the lower end of the hotel, and they all worked very well hand in hand. Breakfast served at the restaurant although delicious did get a little repetitive on all three mornings. But overall, my experience at Yiannaki was quite a memorable one and i would definitely recommend the hotel to all those wanting a little more than just a room to bunk in.",2
"This is an excellent hotel and great value for money. The reception staff are friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble. The food in the restaurant is very good and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Ornos itself is a great resort and we think has the best beach on the island, having visited all six!",1
"Just stayed at the Yiannaki on the last week of September for a week and would definitely recommend. The staff are so friendly and will go above and beyond for you. The hotel itself is lovely! Lovely rooms and very well decorated. The pool area is also lovely with wicker sun loungers. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to ornos beach which is one of the nicest I've been to. The sun beds were 6 euros each but actually really worth it as they were more like beds so really comfy and were all owned by the restaurants so could easily go for a drink or to the toilet. Mykonos town is around a 5-10 minute drive from the hotel and 10 euros in a taxi. I would recommend a taxi over the bus if there are a few of you, the hotel staff were only too happy to order a taxi. The hotel also offers free transfers to the airport which is a lovely touch. I would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay in Mykonos as its a great location and the staff are extremely friendly.",0
"We stayed at the Yiannaki Hotel from 26th September to 3rd October and we were not disappointed.This family run hotel is superb, everyone is so friendly and they cannot do enough for you. Everywhere was absolutely spotless. The food in the hotel restaurant was fabulous and home made and the prices were so good.All the areas are so clean and the WiFi is great there - no problems whatsoever.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel.   Room Tip: The rooms that overlook the pool are really nice but every room is quiet. See more room tips",0
"Many positives to our stay in Yiannaki Hotel. Much appreciated being transfer to and from the ferry port. The hotel property is appealing, clean, and well maintained. The staff is friendly and helpful. The pool is quite nice and reasonably large to swim laps.The pool area is pleasant and comfortable. Breakfast is at the restaurant by the poolside and was adequate, buffet style, and offerings sufficient and varied. The room is clean, comfortable, quiet, and fresh. I'm sure there are larger rooms, and although the view from our room was lacking ( certainly better views for other rooms), this was not an issue as we spent most of our time out and about.It is in Ornos, in a residential area and reportedly a half hour walk to Mykonos town. Close by are 2 beaches one can reach by a short 5-10 min walk but we did not go to.The bus stop is a 5 min walk. That can be the negative in regards to location. However, not to beholden to a bus schedule, acquiring transportation is a must and the location issue becomes a nonissue. By the bus stop we picked up a scooter/vespa - very reasonably priced- and in my opinion the best way to get around Mykonos. The ATV's on Mykonos seem to low powered, slow and struggle going up hill. I suspect if renting a car it can be a problem w/parking around town compared to the scooter . We were two on a scooter and felt quite comfortable and safe. Other drivers were very courteous and gave you plenty of room. Easily drove into Myknos town parking by the central bus depot. Access to beaches were easy and quick by scooter.The scooter was the key to making our stay overall at Yiannaki Hotel a great stay.",0
"Stayed in the Yiannaki for holidays in June and really enjoyed my stay at this lovely hotel. Was to attend a conference in Mykonos this week and chose to return to this hotel rather than stay in a nearby 5 star hotel where the conference was being held. Unfortunately the conference was cancelled at the last minute due the the economic situation in Greece. I contacted the Yiannaki and they were most understanding as to why I had to cancel my booking. They were so gracious. You don't see this kind of treatment in many other hotels, so well done Yiannaki and your management team.",1
"From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we knew we had made the perfect choice. We had a family room, facing the pool. myself and my husband and our 2yr daughter had a fantastic time, the staff are really lovely, very attentive and so friendly. nothing was too much trouble. Our room was lovely and big, plenty of room for a travel cot. The restaurant food was delicious too! The hotel picked us up from the airport and took us back on the way home (despite a 3.5hr delay getting to Mykonos the hotel driver was there waiting for us.   Room Tip: pool facing rooms, family rooms are lovely See more room tips",2
"this hotel is 5 mins from Ornos beach and also from a bus station to town.. the staff is great! very welcoming. . especaillay Vicky and Eleni that helped us a lot in renting a car, what to do in the area, recomended places etc..when the mattris was not very comfortable for me they had a solution and then it was great. the room are clean,comfortable spacious.wifi was great and for free.the only thing is that for me i rather be in the center - Mykonos city since all the buses (not a lot)are exiting from town.",0

"We picked Yiannaki based on TA wonderful reviews and it didn't disappoint. The hotel offered complimentary transfers to/from ferry. We were greeted with orange juice, and coloring book and pencils for the kids (2 and 5 years old), and in the room was a fruit plate and wine. The room itself was spacious, comfortable beds, and a large balcony. Only complaint was that we did have ants. There was always a friendly smile waiting at the front desk ready to answer questions and help (borrowed iron/board, and converters).It was a 10 minute walk to the bakery where you could take a short bus ride to downtown Mykonos. The beach was also close by.",1
"Everything about this hotel was amazing. The location was perfect - very close to town and to all the other beautiful beaches. The owners Yanni and Rula are the nicest people I have ever met. So accommodating and nice all the time. Its a family owned hotel and it runs beautifully. Eleni at the front desk is pleasure so beautiful inside out. The rooms were big, comfortable and very clean. The maid is so sweet and hard working. I highly recommend to eat at the hotel restaurant - no only it is reasonably priced but the best food we eat in Mykonos. We met great people in the hotel and we had the best time. I will definitely come back. Love this place.   Room Tip: The best rooms are with pool views. See more room tips",1
"Went for a week but could have stayed a lifetime. Can't describe how good this hotel is, the food is excellent, the red wine very good and as for the staff nothing is too much trouble whether it is 9am or after midnight. Great hotel, great company, great holiday.",1
This hotel is fantastic.Its about a 10 minute drive from the town of Mykonos.We caught the local bus into Mylonos which was easy. The staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was great and l had the best greek salad there in all of Greece. Great brekky with a huge variety of food.The beach of Omnos was a 5 minute walk and was so beautiful. Be prepared to pay for a lounge chair on the beach for the day but its worth it. The hotel was very clean and it had a balcony with every room.A good sized fridge was in the room which kept everything really cold which was great. Would definately stay here again.   Room Tip: All rooms have a balcony See more room tips,0
"Great hotel near Ornos Beach. Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful particularly Stavroula and Eleni. Rooms were clean and while a little dated were functional. Breakfast was plentiful with many options and very fresh. Pool and pool bar were well utilised and clean. Location is a short stroll from shops, supermarket and beach or boats to other beaches. Ornos is a great location away from the hustle of Mykonos Town but still has plenty to offer. A great place to relax and unwind.",0
"The most wonderful staff. Made to feel very welcome. Rooms are a good size with a king size bed, desk, wardrobe and full size fridge. Bathroom has a very small bath with a good shower over it. Properly plumbed in toilet means no putting toilet paper in a bin ! Air con, TV and nice balcony area. French doors to balcony also have wooden shutters you can use to block out the light. Everything immaculately clean both in the room and around the hotel. Swimming pool was lovely and when I went it was hardly being used. Pool area has lots of rattan furniture including chairs, sun loungers and a swing seat. Beach towels are lent out. The restaurant on site is lovely and it costs no more to have your meal as room service or delivered to the poolside. Dinner served till midnight and very reasonably priced. Breakfast 8-11am and a huge choice available.",2
"Love this place , a great place to retire to after all the awful service along ornos beach , staff are brilliant as is the food , they really care that you have a good time , clean rooms and good breakfast also , top hotel and a great atmospher",1
"The staff are absolutely amazing! Front Desk, housekeeping, restaurant, and breakfast staff. The rooms are on the small but the are clean and comfortable. We stayed for 4 days. The balcony view was worth it. My only complaint was the WIFI service which was bad!   Room Tip: Balcony Room See more room tips",0
"This is a really nice hotel and I can highly recommend it for a relaxing break in Mykonos. The staff are super friendly and helpful, especially reception and the maids do a fantastic job. The restaurant is reasonable and has good food (something we struggled to find outside of the hotel to be honest!) and good service. The breakfast is included and had a good, varied choice. Our room was a good size with comfortable beds and overlooked the garden - this would have been much nicer if the gardens had been tended - even though we could see a sprinkler system amongst the flower beds it wasn't used the whole time we were there (10 days) and it didn't seem as if it had been used all summer as the flowers were all dead - such a shame as this could have made such a difference to the view when sitting on the balcony. The room has a large fridge with the usual mini bar selection but more than enough room to put your own water etc. inside which was very helpful seeing as the bottled water onsite was expensive at 2 euros for a 1ltr bottle - you can get x6 2 ltr bottles for the same price at the supermarket 10 minutes walk away. The pool is salt water so be aware that it can stain your swimsuit yellow so do not wear white when you swim! It's such a pity that the area surrounding the hotel is not very nice as the locals seems to think nothing of litter strewn all about. The roads surrounding the hotel are also not pedestrian friendly, the drivers are quite honestly some of the most manic I have ever encountered in my many visits to many different Greek Islands, and drive far too close to people walking along the side of the road. My husband took to swinging a bag as we walked to keep the cars away after several near misses from wing mirrors! It was quite a stressful experience, especially when you reach the crossroads where the supermarket is located, to cross the road is such a nightmare as the cars are coming at you in 5 different directions, we were amazed we didn't see any accidents. Mykonos Town is a 10 minute bus ride away and for 1.80 Euros was good value (there are not many taxis on the island and the fare for a taxi is about 12 Euros for the same trip) Under 10's travel free on the buses too. Mykonos Town is nice but compared to Santorini for example is just OK. It's expensive and crowded and to be honest, 2 ventures there were more than enough, I can understand why Mykonos tends to be an island that people only visit for a few days rather than going for a week or more as the Brits tend to do.   Room Tip: The best rooms are the pool facing rooms - be aware though that the poolside bar is open late so you... See more room tips",0
"We were booked into this hotel as part of a tour and at first were a bit disappointed after reading other reviews and when we saw where it was located. However those reservations were allayed after the assistance we received from the staff on reception and once we saw our room. The reception staff were able to also able to assist us with information of some local toursThe local bus stop was a short walk away and it was only a short and cheap ride into Mykonos town. We found the hotel was quiet at night and didn't have lots of tourists walking around the streets like there was in the Mykonos township. Our room didn't have a great view as it looked away from the main road but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room so that wasn't a problem.We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast each morning and had dinner there one night. The meal, the service and the drinks were great.",0
"I would definitely stay again at the Yiannaki Hotel. Me and 3 of my other friends booked 2 rooms for a whole week; we visited Mykonos for the closing party week. The staff was very friendly, from their receptionists to their restaurant staff. They're definitely dedicated to providing excellent customer service. I've read in previous reviews, that Ornos is far away from everything, but I would like to differ. In Mykonos, you need an ATV or vespa (which is affordable) to get around, and the hotel was close to everything. Hotel was clean, and I can't forget their amazing restaurant. Highly recommend!",1
"Great hotel really nice and friendly crew,been there just a couple nights but I love it great service and location Excelente. Service fantastic and hotel surroundings aswell. Excelente little bar but with all that you need. Great facility's and good for family's.",1
"Overall I really enjoyed my stay at Vienoula's Garden. It's definitely one of the better choices in Mykonos City - once you have understood that prices on Mykonos Island in high season are just completely crazy and don't necessarily reflect what you get for your money. In this respect Vienoula's Garden offers great value for money (relative to the alternatives) - in absolut terms I believe that ~ 150 EUR/night for a typical 3 star hotel is too much. I probably woulnd't agree with my fellow travellers that Vienoula's Garden ranks currently as # 10 of all hotels in JMK, therefore my assessment is more differentiated. On the plus side: - Hotel is very well managed and family owned. All family & staff members are extremely friendly and helpful - this is true hospitality- Standard rooms are nice and clean and offer all basic features, however nothing fancy- Good (Standard Greek) breakfast with limited choices as mentioned by several other Reviews- Close to the city center (10-15 min walk)What you should be aware: - You're walking to the city center on small road with heavy traffic on 24 hours. Really annoying at night!- It's not really quite (due to the proximity to the street) - so bring ear plugs if you are noise senstitive",0
"We stayed at this hotel as part of a sun island tour, the owners of the hotel could not do enough for us from the first time we met. The rooms were cleaned daily and were modern. I enjoyed the fact the shower was separate from the bathroom and there was plenty of room in both facilities which was very refreshing as we had just completed an 18 day hotel top deck tour around Europe. The pool was very relaxing and the cocktails from the bar were the best we had tasted around Europe and reasonably priced! The hotel is located close to the main town of Mykonos, just a short walk to the town. The wifi was patchy at times but I would definitely recommend this hotel to all and would stay here if I were to visit Mykonos again.",0
"Absolutely loved staying at this hotel! The owner and his beautiful wife, along with all of the staff could not do enough for you! Room was very comfortable with a large bathroom and immaculately clean. Breakfast was basic but who goes to Mykonos to have breakfast! The pool area was beautiful and relaxing. The hotel is set back from the road so never heard any noise from traffic. Only a 5-10 minute walk down the hill to centre of town and bus stop to all the main beaches is 2 seconds away on main road. I would definitely stay in this wonderful hotel again. Absolutely loved it and again have to say the staff were amazing! Thank you so much for taking care of me so well!!",0
"The hotel is right in the middle between the airport and oldtown, comfy location if you have a car, it has a nice parking. The pool area is great. the food was homemad. Accomodation good value for money, a bit basic.What makes this place special is the stuff, the do make you feel at home and will go out of their way to help.   Room Tip: I don't think they have rooms with real bedrooms, just twin beds, put together See more room tips",0
This hotel is a 15-minute walk away from the town center (little Vince area). It is well maintained and clean. Our room was recently renovated in the lower level of the building. Dimitris and Fontina and the other staff were warm and helpful. This place is absolutely beautiful and the new rooms are spacious and gorgeously designed. The room had everything needed and the shower and toilet were separate which is always nice. Would love to stay here again in the future. The owners and staff were so welcoming. All of the guests looked so happy as well. The breakfast can be improved with Omelets and fresh fruits. You can eat inside or outside overlooking the pool. The pool was large and there were plenty of seats. Would highly recommend. See photos.,1
"C'monnn you knew we were a couple and single beds? Pleasant owners, but please your breakfasts are below average..there is no hot breakfast here at all..There is no coffee making in the room or mini bar either..Nice pool tho.Oh there is no ramp either for luggage you have to use steps",0
"Great hotel 10min walk to the town, very friendly, helpful, informative and accommodating staff. Being a smaller hotel makes the experience with staff so much more personal. Couldn't be happier with our decision to stay here, would definitely come again.",1
We booked an island hop tour and this was one of the hotels we were put up in. Very comfortable and extremely friendly staff all around. Always greeting you and going out of their way to make you feel at home. The pool is refreshing and great to just lay around all day by. Definitely want to come back and stay longer.,0
just arrived back from Mykonos we stayed in VIENOULAS GARDEN in Mykonos townwe arrived around 9 pm what a lovely warm welcome we got a free beer each and a talk through the map he gave us and they couldn't do enough for us till the day we leftlovely clean rooms lovely breakfast towels for the pool if and when we needed them lovely couple The young girl and young lad that served us our lovely snacks and drinks around the pool could have not been nicer had a lovely time met a nice couple on day one Mark and Sarah from York,1
"We stayed here from July 22-25, 2016. The owners are a beautiful couple who are very polite. The hospitality from owners and staff are excellent and I would highly recommend to family and friends. The hotel is 10 minute walk from the old town, and is easily accessible to all amenities. Fantastic stay for a reasonable price.",1
"Overall we were very much impressed by all aspects of this hotel. In particular the staff could not do enough to help us. We were a group of 11 and they were always keen to ensure we had everything we needed. We had a few late nights so some mornings they kept breakfast open late in case we needed it! They were happy for us to take their towels to the beach, book a mini bus etc. It seems they are in the process of refurbishing rooms so some - lower floors I think - have been finished to a good standard for this grade of hotel and I think they are, on the whole, larger. Our room, on the top floor was fairly small and old fashioned but still clean, quiet and cool. It is only about 15 mins walk to town, but all uphill on the way back!! Overall I would strongly recommend vienoula's garden - and very reasonable considering the cost of Mykonos generally!",0
"I would like to start by thanking the wonderful staff for making us feel so welcome in their hotel. We were a group of 10 and stayed here on our first visit to Mykonos. We were overwhelmed at the family's hospitality from our arrival until we left. We all stayed in the newly refurbished rooms located on the bottom floor rooms 40-46. The new decor rivals some of the top chain hotels that I have stayed in.I work in the travel industry and have been a holiday rep on other Greek Islands. I was surprised at the high standard of the refurbished rooms and unlike other hotels there is no hidden charges for air con and safe use. The complementary breakfast serves Greek continental with the addition of Dimitris's wife's amazing cakes and pastries that change daily.The hotel is situated just outside the main town, only a short 10 minute walk into the hustle and bustle but far enough out to be extremely quiet and afford complete relaxation. 4 of our friends stayed in the town paying and extra £175 a night for their hotel and were quite put out when they saw our room, number 41. We concluded they had paid the extra for their view. Who would pay £175 extra for a view? Our room had a large patio looking out onto the hotels gardens and got the sun all day.What stands out most though is the family's hospitality, they couldn't have done more for us. We were always welcomed with big smiles, hugs and a good old chin wag. They are genuinely interested in you and go out of their way to get to know you. The pool area is well kept offering plenty of shade and as the hotel is set higher than others gets a wonderful breeze off the Agean sea helping to keep you cool. The sun beds are of high quality too with cushioned padding making them extremely comfortable to lie on which made it extremely difficult to get off them and go and do other things. Especially when Julie and other Dimitris kept bringing out complimentary ouzo shots! Make sure you have one of their Greek salads, they're not on the menu but rival all the top restaurants in town and are half the price! We also had a small party for our friends that are getting married and the staff couldn't have done more helping us get it ready and letting us use a private area near the pool.I don't normally post on sites but I think that we are quick to complain but rarely compliment fantastic service. I couldn't recommend a hotel more. We will definitely be back!",2
"Excellent service, great pool very clean room and amenities and walking distance to the centre. Dimitri and staff were incredible hosts and went the extra mile to make sure I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.",0
"I honestly can't say enough awesome things about this hotel. Location:perfect if you want to be in town, but still have the peace of being away from town. Its about a 15 minute walk or so right down to Mykonos Town.(where much of the restaurants, bars, nightlife, buses are) Bus stops about 5 minutes from the hotel in the other direction also. Just be mindful if you plan to walk, there are hills.(and buses) Room: the room itself was great, better than I expected. We were on the lower level. Room 9. 2 beds. Its away from the pool and main entrance, in the back, but private and safe. The room was super clean, and cleaned every day. Very spacious. Towels in room, and a small fridge. Very roomy closet with a small safe available to use. I honestly didn't notice any noise from other rooms aside from typical outside sounds.Breakfast: great! There were plenty of light eating breakfast options. Don't expect omelettes and a full fare breakfast.start your day with something light to get you going. Boiled eggs, toast, cereal, cookies, tea, coffee. Pool: I didn't swim in the pool because... Paradise beach! But..the pool is gorgeous. And clean! Plenty of pool chairs and towels available when you request.Service: this ius my favorite part. I'm a sucker for hotels with good service! I truly enjoyed the service received by Fortini and Dimitri (forgive my spelling) at check in, we received a map of the island and tons of recommendation and tips. They were so warm and friendly and always willing to give recommendations and tips for getting around. Just based on the service alone, I would come back to Vienoulas Garden. I'm so glad I stayed here. I was so sad to leave when my time in Mykonos ended. Efharisto!!!",0
"What an amazing hotel! The service can only be described as excellent! Dimitris and his family went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I had a medical issue arise and he took me to the pharmacy to get my medicine. I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel. The location is about a 10 minute walk from the town, so you are very close to everything, but without all of the loudness. I highly recommend this hotel and will certainly come back to it if I visit Mykonos again. Thank you for the great experience!",0
"I felt home while staying in vienoulas garden hotel,the management was very kind and responsive to any request we had.Good tips were given by the special (Dmitris) member of the team managing the hotel.Clean Towels are given for the beach everyday.Breakfast home made and enough to give you the energy required for the day.",0
"We had such a wonderful stay at this hotel. It is conveniently located just a short walk from Mykonos Town where you can get buses or other transportation all over the island. The property is quaint, lovely and relaxing. The best part is hospitality. We were treated more like welcomed house guests than like paying customers. The owners and staff are warm, friendly, and helpful. This is a great place to relax and enjoy the island.",0
"This is a lovely little hotel just up the hill from the main town. It's a 10 minute walk to the main town of Mykonos (downhill to the town and uphill back to the hotel). Location-wise we thought it was perfect, not too close to town and far enough to walk off the evenings food and drink! The hotel itself is traditional Greek style with simple but comfortable rooms. We had a first floor room with a large balcony at the front and small one at the rear. The hotel is clean and very well maintained and has a lovely pool area. Breakfast is included and was a nice selection for us (continental breakfast) for those who don't really want a big breakfast it's perfect. The owners are so nice and welcoming and offer lots of helpful tips and advice about the buses, taxis, trips, tours.... they are very knowledgeable and a pleasure to talk to. Mykonos is an expensive place and we found you don't always get the service to match the prices you pay. This place is an exception, good value for a great service. Would recommend.",0
"From the moment that we arrived, we felt truly welcomed by our lovely hosts. Not only did they make us feel special, but helped us get acquainted with Mykonos--restaurants, sites, transportation etc. The hotel was very clean, the breakfast served each morning was quite good, and the location perfect. A 15 minute walk to old town, so far enough away from the crowds, but close enough to the action. I can not say enough about the hospitality we felt.",0
"I can't say enough about the Vienoulas family. The husband and wife proprietors welcomed us like family and shepherded us through a wonderful visit to Mykonos. They answered every one of our newbie questions and pointed us to fun excursions, good restaurants and sunny beaches. I would go back in a heartbeat!",0
Had a great stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Beautiful pool as well. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a quite spot in a city of motion. Would definitely recommend renting ATV's as the island is quite big and the walk to town from the hotel is a little chaotic being on a main roadway with no sidewalks.,0
"This place is quite simply fantastic. The location is perfect in that it is a 10/15 minute walk to Mykonos Town, but in a lovely quiet location. The pool area is stunning, relaxing and clean. The rooms are simple and lovely & clean. Last but by no means least the owners are just wonderful, they cannot do enough for you. There was a really lovely mix of people of all ages at the hotel, which I think is a testament to how appealing it is to everyone. Would DEFINITELY recommend, thank you for a wonderful holiday :)",0
"We had a great time at this gem of a hotel just off the main area of Mykonos town. We were traveling with two young infants and the owners were very accommodating from holding our babies while we enjoyed a delicious breakfast on the patio, to ensuring we had two quiet rooms away from the other guests. The hotel is situated on a main road which leads into town which made for an easy walk to dinner and the sights. Be warned however that there are no 'sidewalks' and not a lot of lighting on the side of the road and there are lots of quads and vehicles speeding by. I highly recommend this little hotel and its gracious owners!   Room Tip: Rooms overlooking the pool have their own little seating area See more room tips",0
A very cute clean and simple place to stay! White washed hotel with pretty scenery. I loved how it was a bit away from noise and crowds but close enough to walk to popular places and buses. The hospitality was amazing and informative. They tell you everything and everywhere you can go and how to get there. The wife and husband were absolutely lovely. Dmitris was very helpful at picking out a place on where to have fun. The pool was also very nice and they give you towels to use as well. The breakfast was nice and simple. My sister and I were very very happy with our visit!!!,0
"My 3 friends and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights! Beautiful.... The staff were so helpful and hospital. They helped us to plan out where to go and everywhere they recommended was great! The rooms are beautiful, big but most importantly.... Clean! What makes this hotel even better.... It is literally a 12 minute walk to and from the town! (I know because I timed it! Lol) The breakfast was continental... Wished they provided hot food but it was still good....especially the freshly made cakes made every morning! Best chocolate brownies ever!!!!!! If I were to go to Mykonos again I would stay in the exact same place! Thank you Demetris and the staff of VG!",0
Had one of the best holidays at this hotel the owners couldn't do enough for us and looking to go back next year for another great holiday Mykonos is a beautiful island that shouldn't be missed in your holiday plans. The town hosts lovely restaurants and a lot of bars that suit all ages with all its beauty you have to go and see it for yourselves,0
"This hotel are a lesson in hospitality! Such lovely people running this hotel - from Dimitri and Fortini the husband and wife team and Dimitris in the evenings. A lovely welcome was received as soon as we arrived, and throughout our weeks stay we enjoyed lovely breakfasts, the lovely clean pool area and our spotlessly clean room with nice balcony overlooking the pool, to the sea and even the sunset. You are a ten min walk from Mykonos town and yes it is a busy road but it's fine if you are careful. We did it everyday for lunch and again in the evening. On the way back at night we used a small torch so that cars could see us. Mykonos town is stunning, small enough to be able to amble around with lovely restaurants and bars. I would love to come back to this hotel and lovely Greek island.",1
"Just stayed at this hotel for 10 days with Olympic holidays (suprised that 10 days B/B was cheaper then 7!). Lovely hotel, with such helpful owners, who kindly helped us carry our suitcases. We were in room 11, which though quite small had a fridge, hairdryer, aircon and small balcony overlooking the pool together with a shared terrace (with next door). Good position as just down some steps to the pool. As everyone else has said this is a very good B/B hotel, clean, sheets and towels changed regularly, lovely pool. No complaints whatsoever. Only suggestion would be that they provide a little more choice for a lunchtime snack - perhaps some salads? And some tomato and cucumber at breakfast would be nice. Great firm bed, best I've ever slept in. Hotel is the other side of town from the Old Port area (where I stayed 23 years ago). Walk into town is up and town slight hills and as mentioned by others not very pleasant because of all the quad bikes, buses, scooters, etc roaring past and there not being a pavement. We always got a taxi back (5 Euro's). There is a taxi rank at the entrance to the old town and there is also a taxi rank near the Old Port, which we used often, however one night we had to wait an hour. Since I was here 23 years ago, they have constructed a new port. This means that cruise ships can now get into Mykonos, and don't you know it! Sometimes the maze of little pathways were so crowded you could hardly walk and restaurants were full to the brim. I guess this is good for business but not particularly for those staying on the island. I found Mykonos, too hot, far too busy and even more expensive then I remembered. Of course, I knew it was an up market island and anyone on a budget should stay well clear, but when we went to Ag.Ioannis (Shirley Valentine beach), they wanted 30 Euro's for the sunbeds outside the Hippie Fish restaurant. Further along the beach they charge 14 Euro's. In town, a simple 1 course salad & one drink each was often 45 Euro's. Just as well my sister and I don't eat much!! Good that the island attracts so many different nationalities and ages - Argentinian, Israeli, European, Amercian, Japanese. However, in summary, I feel that the island is best suited to the early 30's and those with deep pockets. Afraid, I won't be going again.   Room Tip: Room 11 has a balcony and a shared terrace. Just down some steps to the pool. See more room tips",0
"My son and I stayed there for 3 nights. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel any time and would stay there again.Location is perfect, walking distance from city center and on a bus route",0
"Just back from two weeks staying here. It's not a five star hotel but has everything. You need and more. Dimitri and Fortini can't do enough to ensure you have a wonderful stay. Value for money, this must be one of the best hotels in Mykonos and only a five minute walk into Mykonos town. Will definitely be back!!",0
"It is not often that we return to the same place twice ! So this is the Second time we have stayed at this Hotel , I would just like to say this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in , Demetri and Fortini made us feel so welcome and they cannot do enough for you , Rooms are spotless as always , lovely pool area , Fotini home made cakes at Breakfast , The new rooms look amazing ! Thanks for the sneak Preview ! Should prove very popular , Hopefully see you next year ! Stock up on the Mastica , This hotel is well worth a visit just check all the positive reviews on here .",0
"Stayed in this hotel for a week as a couple. Pool area is fantastic and always sunbeds available. Friendliest staff imaginable, always willing to help and wish you a pleasant day. Bit of a trek down to the town (about 10 mins) but quite nice to get some exercise throughout the week! Great breakfast (if you like cake) and rooms spotlessly clean. Would not hesitate staying in this hotel again.",0
We don't usually return to a holiday venue as we like to ring the changes but will definitely return here. The owners and staff couldn't do enough for us. Lovely pool and gardens. Pleasant breakfast. Very nice room with good amenities. Very clean. Very good value. Can't praise this hotel enough. It surpassed all our expectations.,0
"It's the second time I'm staying at Dimitri's family hotel and it is an absolute pleasure.The hospitality is excellent. Dimitri and his wife are kind and look very well after their guests. They have recently refurbished the rooms, and extended the hotel with new rooms that are even better.The location is particularly good if, like us, you like to be close to town but not literally bang into town. The good restaurants of the city centre are within 10 min walk.There are buses to town if you are not into walking... and there's a car park at the hotel. This time we have rent a car to roam the island.Pool is clean and nice. Bar menu is basic and affordable.I would definitely come back here while in Mykonos!",0
"I only stayed one night at this little hotel with adorable white and blue architecture, but it still left an impression of great hospitality. Upon checking in, we were given a map and a verbal mini-tour of town using the map, including how to get to popular sights, where to eat, and other useful tips that helped us make the most of our short time there. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and included some homemade items.",0
"I chose this hotel based on previous tripadvisor reports and I am so glad I did. The hotel is run to perfection, it is immaculately clean, extremely well organised and the owners Dimitri and his wife Fotini are simply the best hosts I have met. We were allocated room 31 which was perfect and cleaned every day to a very high standard. Breakfast was simple but with the addition of home made pastries every morning and everything was fresh every day. The pool was ideal and cleaned every day. The location was perfect near enough to the town to walk but great at night as it was far enough away from the madness of the town to get a great nights sleep. The owns were a font of knowledge and helped everyone on arrival with all the information you needed but were also helpful and available during our stay.The bar was great and very reasonable and the barman also Dimitri was great fun along with night porter/barman Mickie all in all one of the best holidays we have ever had. Thank you Dimitri Fotini and your team for making it so special.Bob n Sheila.   Room Tip: all rooms seemed to be of a good standard See more room tips",1
"Myself and two girlfriends stayed at this hotel from the 04/06/16-11/06/16 and absolutely fell in love with the hotel and the staff. On the first day I was ill and they couldn't of helped anymore and put ,e in a taxi to the medical centre. On my birthday they made ,e a beautiful cake and surprised me with it at our hotel room along with 2 bottles of prosecco and partied with us for a couple of hours. They waited on us hand and foot whilst we were there and could never do more to help us. We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we were to visit the island and would urge anyone looking to go to Mykonos to stay at this hotel... It completely made our holiday.... This ones for you Dimitris ""YYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY"" Lots of love Kelly, Leanne and Becca xxxxxxxxxxx",0
"My sister and I booked a room here for our first trip to Mykonos, and we loved it! Fotini gave us such a warm welcome and was happy to provide plenty of information about the island. It was very easy to get to Mykonos Town, Little Venice, the mini market, and the bus stop by foot (it's a little downhill on the way there and uphill on the way back). The hotel, rooms, and pool were quiet and sparkling clean. Breakfast every morning was FABULOUS and someone was available 24/7 to answer any questions or to help arrange transportation services. Rates were very reasonable, free wifi, air conditioning, and you may request a beach towel to bring with you to any of the beaches.",0
"We are free style tourists and don't spend much of our vacation at the hotels we book.We expect it to be very clean, safe, and friendly. This hotel went above our expectations. The manager bent over backwards working with my wife to retrieve her lost luggage. Rule number one: travel light and move fast. If the items you need for your trip don't fit into a carry on, you're bring too much!!! The hotel was very clean and well maintained. Has a very nice pool which we did not use. Was located a mile or so from town center. We rented a four wheeler to get around the island. I'd rent a car thenext time. FYI, you need a motorcycle endorsement on your drivers license to rent a scooter.   Room Tip: make sure your room has a double bed it your traveling as a couple See more room tips",0
"Lovely hotel in a quiet location just 10 minutes walk in to mykonos town bus station, Staff are very welcoming and helpful, our room was clean and comfortable with a very fast wifi connection, would definitely stay here again.",0
"Lovely place-very warm & friendly, attentve staff. It's a hotel that is run as a bed & breakfast. Rooms were clean & spacious. Had balconies & fridge. Nice pool area & outdoor terrace with seating. Breakfast was simple & always included a home-made pastries. Location just outside of Mykonos town (1/2 mile). I did use a small flashlight at night while walking back in the evening. The bus stop & motor bike rental place is just across the street",1
"A week long stay at this charming family run hotel. We were made to feel most welcome by the owners who looked after us for the whole week with restaurant recommendations, details of the bus times and routes to beaches. A brilliant breakfast was provided a lovely pool on site and a great bar, seating area. An easy walk down to the sea front , we got a cab back up for 5euro because I am a lazy mare, many walked back. We will return , of that we are sure. Thank you so much",0
"We were greeted with a smile and a warm welcome as soon as we walked up the hotel steps after the taxi dropped up us off from the airport (5 minute journey incidentally).This warmth and friendliness lasted the whole time we were there and made it a fabulous place to stay.The guests were mainly middle-aged couples, with a few younger ones and a couple of families. The majority British, and many from a wide range of other countries (from America to Italy).I was there with my two sons (12 and 15) who thoroughly enjoyed the pool and wifi. ... what more do teenagers want? The room was a good size, with air con and a much-needed fridge. Nice balcony, and it was kept tidy and clean with daily attention from the cleaners.It was a 10-minute walk to Fabrika - the square in Mykonos town where you can get buses to the beaches and 15 minutes from a nice quiet beach... so very handy for going to town for meals and evenings. Several convenience stores are within 5 minutes walk of it.Breakfast was a nice straightforward cold buffet selection (bread, toast, cereal, cake, ham, cheese yoghurt, etc). No food served the rest of the time, while the bar is open all the time for drinks, coffee, etc.I would thoroughly recommend it for families and couples wanting a relaxed, friendly, clean and inexpensive hotel that is pretty close to the action (but far enough not to get any noise)Overall a lovely   Room Tip: Apparently the downstairs rooms are the nicest (but won't have views) See more room tips",1
"this is a great, clean family run business just outside of Mykonos town. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and displayed kind regard for the guests. The rooms all had balconies I believe. The AC unit worked well. My only concern was the walk into town. Yes, it is not far but it is a little scary walking down the street with no side walk. I think people that live there are quite used to it but what scared me was the tourists renting cars, mopeds etc..Bring good walking shoes too. Mykonos town itself was a great place to just sit and people watch. you can also just walk a block or so down the hill and catch the bus to the beaches.   Room Tip: wifi access is so-so at times See more room tips",0
I have stayed at many large five star hotels which have been fantastic but this hotel has to be one of the biggest surprises! The owners make you feel as though you are staying in their home which is spotlessly clean. Nothing is too much trouble here. It is really worth a visit,0
"The owners of this hotel were so sweet!The breakfast was delicious and every morning we had great conversations with the staff.In America people typically steer clear of room service or hotel bars, but we quickly realized it was cheaper to drink at the hotel than at the bars so we frequently started at Vienoula's. That being said, the prices were very reasonable and the company was good.Whenever we had questions about the town or where to eat or even needed a beach towel they were very happy to help us. At one point my boyfriend lost his wallet on a bus and they helped us call around and get it back the next day.The hotel is also in a very good part of town. It is a short walk in to the city center, just far enough away from the crowds, but still close enough to be convenient to walk to and from our room to the shops multiple times a day.We loved our stay here!",1
This hotel small but tucked away from the mykonos city center is a gem to relax in....it is away from the hustle and bustle of mykonos town but a short walking distance from it....it has a great pool to relax in after walking from the town....very clean ..although the bathrooms are very small and breakfast is basic...the hosts are wonderful and friendly people who made our stay very joyful for us in this beautiful island.,1
"Just back from a weeks stay and thought I would post an instant review as we had a most enjoyable stay. Our wonderful hosts Dimitris and Fortina were most helpful with any requests and would always have time to stop and chat, plenty of comfortable sunbeds with towels supplied. Have to mention the showers, as there was always a constant supply of hot water. Town restaurants are just 10 minutes walk away, but do check prices as some can be very expensive. Totally recommend Vienoulas, with no exceptions.k",2
"Just came back from a week at Vienoula's Garden and I couldn't wait to give it 5 stars on trip advisor! As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the loveliest staff, so accommodating and throughout our stay gave us the best recommendations for restaurants, bars, beaches and travelling around the island. Some of the restaurants recommended by the staff ended up being our favourites and one we even went back to a second time. The rooms were clean and hotel facilities were good. Breakfast was simple but delicious, fresh greek yoghurt and fruit, cereal, toast etc and a cake baked fresh each day. The hotel felt so homely and relaxing. Although we spent minimal time at the pool as there are so many amazing beaches, we found it ideal to relax by for a few hours before heading to the airport. SUCH a good holiday!! Hope to be back at some point.   Room Tip: choose a garden facing room See more room tips",1
"This hotel is immaculately kept, everything gleams, ready for the new season. The location is good, a pleasant ten minute walk into the town and harbour. We were there 07/05-14/05 and the weather was wonderful. Mykonos town is a sight to be seen and the quality of the restaurants and cafes is excellent. Having a car was really useful to explore the quieter beaches on the north shore and also helped us to appreciate just how delightful our hotel was. Domitris, Fortini and their staff are on hand to make sure you have everything you need for your stay and are genuinely friendly and welcoming.",3
Really lovely property. Very nice hosts at the property. Close to the main city. Walking distance from a Bike/car renting shop. Will surely stay at the same property if plan to visit Mykonos again in future. Class A property for couples. Breakfast could be better.,3
"This quiet hotel is a 10 minutes walk from the centre. It has a swimming pool with very good beds around it and you can sit out off the wind. The service is very good. They are always there to help you. The room is just right and has a very small balcony. In the room there is a quiet refrigerator. It 's a pity we had no WiFi in our room, we could get the signal from other hotels in the neighbourhood. I hope that the hotel can fix this. You have to shower in the bath. It has a shower curtain. The towels are changed every day and when you want to go to the beach or stay at the swimming pool then you can use towels provided by the hotel. Mykonos is a bit difficult to walk around because you have to walk next to the road as there is no separate food path and it's at times a bit steep. The wind is always blowing.",0
"We were greeted and instantly made to feel as though we were staying in a family home. Very comfortable accommodation, great location, excellent service and highly recommended. When we return to Mykonos we will stay again.",0
"We were lucky enough to have stayed at Vienoula's Garden as part of our holiday through the Greek Islands last year. The owners and staff were fantastic nothing was to much trouble, and they went out of their way to make our time in Mykonos truly memorable.",0
We stayed here for 11 nights in July 2015. On arrival we were greeted with smiles and shown to our room (we had requested a large balcony if possible - and they delivered!) It's only a 10 minute walk into Mykonos town and a further 5 to little Venice. If you're lucky the buses will stop outside the hotel on way to/from beaches!If you go to Mykonos you need to experience as many of the beaches as possible. None of them disappoint!!,1
Great time staying in a really nice room with nice amenities. Well maintained property with sparkling pool and gardens. Only a short walk to the centre of town. Quite and relaxing place. Good breakfast provided. Decent bar in lobby area. The hosts/owners were a fantastic young couple who were extremely accommodating and friendly. Plenty of off street parking.   Room Tip: Upstairs has balconies with better views. See more room tips,0
"I stayed at Vienoulas Garden thi summers for the second time and had a wonderful week. Dimitri and his wife are the perfect hosts and all staff are friendly. I'm not sure when I will be going back to Mykonos next but this will be my first choice of hotel. It's close to Mykonos town, has a fabulous pool and since its up the hill, there are great sunset views!   Room Tip: Ask for a balcony where you can see the sunset See more room tips",2
"My fiance and I stayed in Mykonos for 3 days (wish we had stayed more). Unfortunately, as we were travelling to Mykonos, my fiance suffered a minor, but painful, eye injury. She was in severe pain and incapacitated from the moment we arrived on Mykonos. The awesome folks here got us in touch with an ophthalmologist and helped me arrange transportation and medicines get my lady feeling better. I can't imagine how I would have done it without them (I was panicing and very stressed). The pool, patio and dining area is very comfortable. They also have a fully stocked bar if you wish to grab a drink. Rooms were extremely clean and had a rustic vibe that I liked. The hotel is located just outside of main town, so you can walk there if you like, or take a bus, or rent a car/atv. Renting a vehicle also allows you to more easily explore the various beaches, etc. We didn't get to do much in Mykonos, but when we go back, we're definitely staying here again!",0
"Really nice place to stay and very hospitality staff! Feels like home. The hotel located quite closer to the Mykonos city (Chora), 10 minutes to walk, in a qiuet zone. If you tired from the beach or city walk, you can stay at the hotel's swimming pool and have a strawberry margarita. You'll be surrounded by the good service, cozy rooms and a feeling that you are very important guest.",2
"Def stay here again only ten minutes from airport and ten minute walk to town or a 5 euro taxi ride , lovely laid back hotel spotlessly clean, pool area spotless , knocks the socks of some of these four and five star hotels , dimitri his wife and all the staff nothing is too much trouble for them will def go back when I'm mykonos again .",0
"We were in Mykonos for one night en route to Naxos, and luckily we stayed at the Vienoula Gardens. The place is a quiet oasis away from the bustle of town, but is close enough to be able to walk there. We were there with our children aged 6 and 4, but they still managed to walk down the hill into town without issues (we took a taxi back to the hotel).It was great having a pool to un-wind and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was provided at no extra charge and was enjoyable. But the best thing about the hotel was the welcome we received. All of us felt some comfortable and it is rare to find that in hotels these days. Despite only being at the hotel for about 15 hours, we left with plenty of hugs and regret that we only had one night there. We hope to return",0
"Great hotel to stay, the owners are very lovely and make you feel welcome. Pool area and gardens were maintained and kept really nice. Breakfast was great each day. Easy access to Mykonos town and public transport.",3
"I would thoroughly recommend staying at this pretty, traditional Greek hotel. The staff made us feel extremely welcome and were set on making sure we had the best stay possible. They were always ready to give us recommendations and seemed to know everything about the island. The room itself was lovely, equipped with a beautiful terrace and comfortable interiors. The garden was also very well kept and was a peaceful retreat from the bustling centre of Mykonos town. The road to the town was short but we had to be careful of the traffic, purely due to the fact they don't really have pavements in Greece. Other than that, buses and reasonably priced car/quad bike rental made it very easy for us to explore the rest of the island from the hotel.   Room Tip: Rooms facing West probably have the nicest views/balconies See more room tips",0
"As we only stayed for night each at the beginning and the end of our holiday we wondered what to expect but need not have worried. Great hosts, always on hand, nothing too much trouble, even given pool towels for a short stay both times. The breakfast was much better than many to be had in Greece. Very nice to be able to have swim before the next leg of a journey and snacks to order at a very reasonable price. Convenient for to and from the airport and port, but no noise. It is worth noting (we did not until next morning) there are evening snacks to be had, mainly Pizza, but this does save a walk into town and the over priced food there, especially if only there for 1 night. The 10 minute walk down into town is OK, but there a ""marked"" sidewalk which traffic does observe. Overall, would recommend Vienoula and would return if this way again",0
"The hotel, it's grounds and room were perfectly kept and impeccably clean!The staff always friendly and smiling.The couple who run the hotel knowledgable, personably, helpful.Lovely and relaxing pool area, lobby area with nice sitting area and a well stocked bar Breakfast: It was better then most me and my partner tend to be picky eaters yet not so much so that we can't generally muddle through and find something we enjoyWith this selection we had enough to get our day goingThe room:As I said impeccably cleanNice little balcony Fridge Fantastically powerful blow dryer (which I really enjoyed)Great lighting in the bathroom with excellent water pressureLocation: short (but occasionally scary) walk to town which for us was very important. Like other reviews mention there is NO sidewalk and the street is very narrow you must be alert and stay as close to the edge as you can. At night we walked with the flashlights on our cellphone so cars could see us. The walk back is uphill but nothing crazy or unmanageable for the average person. The two cons that I must mention Which may vary in importance to others but for us we felt it1. The wifi was pretty spotty and not strong 2. The bed was not comfortable These two factors were not nearly enough of a negative for me to not recommend this placeIt was a fantastic choice of stay For the price it CERTAINLY exceeded what I was expecting",2
"My wife wanted a small blue and white hotel with not many rooms. This fitted the bill perfectly. Everybody so friendly, Dimitrius and his wife Fotini couldn't do enough to help. The down side was that for us it was a short bus ride into town. Some fellow clients thought the road was dangerous, particularly at night. Overall a very enjoyable stay.   Room Tip: stayed in room 3 very comfortable See more room tips",1
"from the moment we were picked up from the port, till the moment we left. We were treated like family.Very friendly warm inviting place to stay. Beautiful pool area.10minute stroll into town. If you don't like hills then catch a cab back for 5 EU or bus for 1.80 EU.Rooms are clean very basic. Our bathroom was very small. Bit hard for a 6 foot 2 guy to move around. Bus to the beach just down the road, as well as a hire car place.",0
"What a great small and friendly hotel, just the sort my wife and I like, Dimitrius and wife Fotini couldn't do enough for you the same can be said of the staff, our room No 2 was always cleaned every day, hotel was spotless. Outside 50mtrs away the bus stop to Mykonos town, buses at least every half hour, cost 1.80 euro's one way well worth it with the heat. We'd like to say thank you to Dimitirius and Fotini for making our stay and holiday something to remember. If we return to Mykonos we would definitely stay at this hotel without hesitation. Ken+Rita Grice. stayed 2/9/15 to 9/9/15 room No 2.   Room Tip: We had ground floor room No 2 we enjoyed it sunny and secluded.. See more room tips",1
"I chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews. The road situation is not as bad as people make out, so long as you are sensible and walk single file and your not completely wasted its fine. 10 minutes walk into town down hill on the way in or if you can't be bothered a 1 minute bus ride for €1.80 daytime or €2.30 at night. The people at the hotel are really friendly and helpful they give you the bus time table where you can get everywhere. The pool is lovely although sun beds are in short supply when it's busy. The breakfast is nice and you can eat outside. It's less than 10 minutes to the airport and Ornos beach and not far from the new port if arriving by ferry (get on the bus it's €1.80). There is a bus stop opposite, a mini market and bike hire place. The beds are soft, air con is good and the private balconys are nice with the sea view. The lock on the door was a bit iffy and there was a knack to opening and locking it and you had to slam it to make sure it catcher but we had a safe in the room so no worries. It is a very clean hotel and the people who stay here seemed to be decent well behaved people, no issues with loud noise or bad behaviour. i would recommend this hotel as good value base for a stay in Mykonos.",1
We stayed here for 3 nights and we were blown away with the absolute hospital like cleanliness of the entire establishment. The Pool area is well above par for a hotel of this star rating. The family who run it were absolutely charming and very accommodating. Any return to Mykonos will be at this hotel as it provides that perfect balance of cost / facilities and personality. Should be far higher than 14.,0
"Stayed at this hotel for 1 week, just got back couple of days ago. Booked the hotel based on the tripadvisor ratings and we were not disappointed. The owner, his wife and the whole team of staff are lovely and helpful. They provided us with all the information to plan our trips i.e where to eat, which beaches to visit, how to get there etc.We were given two rooms for the four of us, the rooms are nice and clean with a private balcony. The rooms are cleaned everyday. Breakfast is served from 7.30am till 10am, though we missed our breakfast some days, the staff were more than happy to provide us with tea and biscuits.The pool area is very clean with sunbeds and lots of tables and chairs to relax.The hotel is a ten minute walk into the town centre down a hill. Getting back to the hotel up the hill can be dificult especially during the hot weather. Also the road doesn't have a proper pavement and is a little busy, but it is a safe area. Buses to the beaches can be caught from the mini market which is near the hotel or from the town centre.",1
From the moment you enter the door you will feel welcomed to the Family of the owner Dimitri and his lovely wife. it is very clean and its a great area because from its name it is surrounded with a big garden and away from the noises of bars and cars and everything to get a good night rest after the partying and so on. breakfast was very healthy and nice...all the essentials of a great breakfast is provided especially Dmitri's wife's baked everyday cake that is out of this world. I personally loved the stay there...everything was convenient. u had a market 5 mins walk away and the town 10 mins walk away. great big parking for your cars...i really miss them because i really felt like i was a son to them full of caring and loving... thats how they make you feel. If Dmitri is reading this or his wife i say again i really thank you...   Room Tip: try to find an entrance from the parking so you can park your car and hop to your room directly....

"Stayed here for 3 nights high season and my wife and I delighted with Hotel. Lovely pool with loads of seating and shade. Good bar snacks and drinks. The breakfast is more than adequate and plenty to start your day off. The Owner and his wife are extremely lovely people, friendly and helpful all the time. The rooms are clean and tidy with comfortable beds and nice little balcony (room 24). Good WiFi as well. We would recommend this hotel to our friends for future visits but book early. Of particular mention is Thomas who works hard and provides everyone with good service. Good luck at Uni!   Room Tip: Room 11 best apparently but 24 fine. See more room tips",1
"I can't say how amazing the holiday wasBrilliant location 2 mins walk to bus stop to take you all over the island for €1.60Downhill walk (10mins) into the lovely town with so many fantastic restaurantsThe hotel is family run with a fantastic breakfast amazing cocktails, a lovely pool And big cushion sunbeds Everywhere has air-conditioning which is perfect as it is so hot outside and the hotel inside and outside is spotlessly cleanWe are definitely booking to go back Dimitri is a star he will talk to you about where to go on the island and give you his secret beaches to go t",1
"Stayed here during our honeymoon and it was a very pleasant, memorable stay. The hotel is beautiful and located in a quiet area that's a short walk downhill to the centre of Mykonos. The staff were incredibly helpful and courteous during our 3 night stay. The pool outside is immaculate and we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast on our private balcony each morning. We left Mykonos vowing to return to this lovely hotel!",0
"We ended our 2 weeks of island hopping with 2 nights here. We weren't prepared for the noise, mayhem and madness of Mykonos after 12 nights in smaller, quieter, cheaper Cyclades islands. But wanting to visit Delos and flying home from Mykonos, how glad were we that we were staying in this oasis of friendly, calm, quiet, clean, comfortable accommodation! Dimitri picked us up from the new port, and he, his wife and all the staff are all extremely good at what they do. It's a manageable walk out of Mykonos town, handy for buses, with a mini market just down the road. Some guests were just heading out on the town as we were coming back from our evenings out, but we never heard them return.Even after we checked out we were still looked after with use of a shower room and dressing area until it was time to head to the airport 5 mins up the road.Stay here.",1
"We stayed there with 2 other young couples. We were greeted by the staff and they spoke English and had our rooms ready for us on arrival. All of our rooms were big, spacious and clean. Very simple but comfortable. The pool area is perfect for the amount of guests in the accommodation and very relaxing with the pool bar service. We enjoyed a variety of drinks from ice coffees to sunset cocktails! Very short walk to town, close to all restaurants, pubs, clubs, buses.",0
"My daughter and I stayed there May 28th for one week. The first thing that impresses you is the genuine hospitality you receive on arrival which continues all the way through your stay. Our room had a balcony as I think they all do, with a view of the sea, and the sunset. Adequate comfortable beds, changed every single day we were there with fresh towels. Poolside was also immaculately maintained with modern sun beds. The interior was traditionally Greek, with a good bar, and snacks available. Overall was a fantastic experience in a quiet hotel near enough to the fabulous Mykonos Town but far enough away to sleep peacefully.   Room Tip: Good views in all rooms See more room tips",1
Our 7th visit to this fabulous hotel. Dimitri and Fotini are wonderful hosts and have become very special friends to us. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very comfortable with a fridge and hairdryer. Beach and pool towels are provided daily and pool cleaned regularly with very comfy sun beds. Hotel is 1st class and all staff are very helpful and friendly. Dimitri makes fab cocktails and Fotini's cakes are amazing . We will see you next year!,0
First really brilliant staff. They treat you like friends not hotel staff. When we first got there we had a intro to where to go in Mykonos and how not to get lost. We then got shown to our room we had two single beds which i was really happy about but we decided to push them together. The room is well kept and cleaned every day if you want it. The shower room is very modern and a lovely powerful shower. You get a hair dryer which is really handy. You also get a balcony we used it to watch the sunset every night really nice! Beds comfy an the pillows are better then mine at home! We wanted to rent a quad bike and because the hotel staff had been really nice i trusted them to ask where to rent one from. He rang them up an got them to come an got us. Wasnt just one of the dodgy guys on the street either it was professional. You can park your quad at the front of the hotel. We had breakfast once which was nice. We aren't morning people so we didn't bother again as we would rather have our sleep then have a lunch. The pool was brilliant the sun beds where sometimes full up but we always managed to get a bed. They were really comfy and the wooden umbrellas were a god sent when it got really hot. The milkshakes an the pool service was brilliant always there when you needed them. We had wine a-clock twice an it was lovely next to the pool. Brilliant cocktails too!! If you need anything from them they will help you out or find you away to find out. If there was more to do on the island we would defiantly go back to this hotel if it was the same people. Thank you for having us and we wish you all the best!,0
I have just returned from a fantastic ten night holiday in Mykonos. I have travelled here on many occasions in the past and have stayed in some lovely hotels. The Petinos Beach Hotel is by far the very best I have stayed in. It is in a fantastic location right on the beach. The hotel staff are always very helpful and nothing is too much trouble if you need any help. The breakfast is unbelievable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Mykonos who is looking for a beach location rather than in the centre of Mykonos Town.   Room Tip: A room with a sea view is fantastic See more room tips,0
"It was great week of my life with my family and couples friend from New York , great experience with Petinos Beach Hotel. The service was amazing. Champagne drinks, friendly concierge and employees. Very clean, beautiful view. And overall it was a great experience for a reasonable price all together. George Chedrawi",0
"This was our first time in Mykonos and the staff @ PBH made us feel right at home. My wife and I traveled here with 2 other couples for a leg of our vacation. Everyone was very helpful and the breakfast spread was great too. The servers there were very friendly and made it pleasant each morning. A special thanks to Vasia @ reception who I shared multiple emails with regarding airport transportation because our flight was delayed! She arranged everything, and transportation was there waiting for the 6 of us when we landed. Thank you Petinos Beach for making Mykonos a memorable experience. We hope to come back again at some point!",0
"The Petinos beach hotel has a very whimsical feel. The lobby is white and airy, the staff is excellent and location very good. The hotel is on the beach, pool is very nice (seating can be limited), there is also a nice sundeck. The restaurant, Thea, serves a great breakfast and would be a great dinner option as well as there are nice views of the water. I stayed in the main hotel and was presently surprised when I got there with a complimentary room upgrade! My very spacious room was so lovely with a large balcony overlooking the beach and pool, hot tub and nice amenities. There is a public bus accross the street to the town of Mykonos (about 15-20 min ride) as well as water ferry just beside the beach to the various parts of the island. Aphrodite helped me with great recommendations for my short (sadly 1 day) stay, the windmills are a must see and the venetian port is great for watching the sunset. There are lots of great shops and restaurants in mykonos town as well. I also got a pedicure at the spa which i would recommend if you need a break from the sun, or in my case had an hour wait between checkout and catching the ferry. The hotel also provides very nice transportation. I am planning to go back to Petinos next July to celebrate my sister's 40th birthday! Mykonos provides a great balance of beach/relaxation, shopping and nightlife! Can't wait!!! Highly recommend a stay at Petinos Beach Hotel!",0
Nice location right next to the beach and bus stop however rooms do not look like the pictures and are small noisy and unclean. I had a dead spider in my sheets... We are next to the generate and service entry so it is very noisy. We had to remind them to service the room. Would recommend seeing the room or not having a 'garden' room if you choose to stay here,0
"This hotel has a good cost benefit. Even being a small hotel, you will have all you need in Mikonos without paying an unaceptable price.Petinos beach is in a beach considered ""proper for all, including families"" (there are several beaches in Mikonos considered ""crazy"" beaches, not recomended for families). You will have many cruises options departuring right next/ in front of the hotel, taxi boats that can drive you to other beaches, mini-markets and several restaurants everything in no more 2 minutes walking.The beach is good for swimming and snorkling. There are many water sports, but it start price is $50 euros. Sunbeds and umbrellas starting ate $15. Don't go to the restaurant with free Sunbeds option. They will charge will 10 euros a Coke.Room is good, great breakfast and Hotel restaurant (Thea Restaurant) is simply great in a very fair price.",1
"Room was amazing, view was amazing but the PEOPLE who work there are especially amazing. Dimitri who worked at the hotel's restaurant The Blue Myth, went out of his way everyday to make our vacation very special and Aphrodite at the front desk was so helpful to us in every way. The hotel is ideally located right on the beach, 1 minute walk to the bus to take you into Mykonos town and a great mini-market right there as well bottles of water only 50 cents in euros each. There is a water taxi to take you to other beaches too. The best offer to take advantage of was that you can get a free sunbed and towel as long as you eat lunch in a few of the restaurants right on the beach that offer this deal. We traveled as a family with my husband, son 28 years old and daughter 15 years old. Great hotel, great vacation.   Room Tip: Room with a view of the beach is lovely See more room tips",1
"i really like the hotel, the resto was great, kind employees,clean and nice room, and you can chill and enjoy the pool that is in another section. My best friend and I really enjoy our stay.The beach is just beside. Amazing spot.",0
"Very warm and friendly stuff, the breakfast buffet is tge best Ever, really didnt know what to choose from the huge variety, kids will love it too..beautifull view on a quiet family beach with shallow waters perfect for kids.",0
"Had a fantastic experience at the Petinos hotel.The staff are amazing and will go out of there way for you, loved their pleasant welcoming every day,The rooms are clean, spacious and in a perfect location If you stay at petinos hotel you use the pool at petinos beach hotel, They are both close to each other,The breakfast was great, so much variety..The bus into town is right at your door and runs every 30 minutes I will stay here all the time..",1
"We spent two weeks Greek island hopping and stayed in 4 hotels in total (2 in Mykonos). Having visited Mykonos several times and staying at the same hotel in the town, we wanted to spend a couple of nights in a different location on the island. This hotel was not a patch on the others, although it was one of the most expensive. The room was across the road from the 5 star reception, in what appeared to be in a 4 star sister hotel. It was fairly basic, clean and pleasant, (not 5 star, more 3 or possibly 4) with double sinks in the bedroom and the smallest bathroom, just room for a bath, toilet and the door to swing shut! We had no towels in the room, which reception did not seem to grasp at all, we were promptly presented with beach towels, which sufficed. The bed was very comfortable but the corridors were incredibly echoey and noisy at night. Despite shutters on the balcony, we were awoken at dawn by the light from the bathroom window, as the handless door meant you could not shut it from inside the bedroom! The swimming pool has very few sun beds and all are taken first thing. Breakfast was back across the road once again, to a very lovely restaurant overlooking the bay. The buffet was exceptional and definitely worthy of 5 stars, just a shame about the room.",1
"We spent a week in the hotel in July 2016.The hotel facilities are excellent : room with air con, restaurant, swimming pool and spa (didn't use either of these).The single thing that really made it for us was the service at breakfast / other meals / drinks in the restaurant area. All the staff made us feel really welcome - friendly but un-obtrusive.Worth mentioning that although the hotel was apparently fairly full, it never felt busy - very relaxing.Very good location - right by the beach. We will definitely return !!   Room Tip: Difficult to make recommendation, as the hotel is on many levels. I imagine all the rooms are good... See more room tips",0
"We were in Greece for three weeks traveling to various places and islands. I stayed here with my husband and teenage children for 4 days. It was great. Wished we stayed linger Location is excellent, the hotel beauriful. My children rated it the best part of their holiday.",0
"Overall very nice hotel in a very great location. The pool is very relaxing and beautiful and right along the beach. The quality and service were very mediocre compared to many other hotels we have stayed at. It was very frustrating because when we first arrived at the pier from our ferry, it took over an hour for our hotel shuttle to pick us up, and we had to eventually find a cab on our own. Also, every time we called the front desk, no one would ever pick up. We had to carry down all of our own luggages. When we complained they said the front desk number was some random number verses the standard ""0,"" which we were never told, nor was there a guide/ key on the phone pad. Beware at your complimentary breakfast because if you accidentally sit 2 tables down from the designated area unknowingly, you will be charged for your breakfast.",0
"What an amazing hotel! Our room had such a wonderful view (room 215). It was immaculate, clean, fresh and so spacious. The staff were so friendly and readily available to assist us with anything. The breakfast is amazing, there is so much choice!! On top of this the hotel is in a sensational location, right next to Nammos and the bus stop is right at your door stop! My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here!!! Hopefully we will one day come back",1
"Beautiful hotel and accommodations. Amazing views. Great service and fantastic location. Great Value for the location and Mykonos - close to great beaches, town bus, stores and restaurants. Will definitely return soon. Great for couples and families.",0
"Very friendly staff. Great service. Great buffet breakfast and a very nice hotel restaurant. Great view from the balcony of room. Can see water, beach other restaurants and hotels. Great pool area and many chairs or lounges Room a little small, very small area around the sink. Great location. Many restaurants shops markets right outside. Would stay there again.",0
"A review here just couldn't go to enough lengths to recommend this hotel enough.Booked for my special birthday and from the minute we arrived, we were made to feel like royalty.On arrival - we were greeted by the front of house team with a glass of champagne whilst we checked in. Our bags were taken from us and dealt with as we were shown to our room where every detail was covered. Room was minimal but very nice and spotless. They then showed us to the balcony and THE VIEW! Absolutely amazing! Overlooking the pool and the sea. Stunning by day and by night.Towels changed 2/3 times a day.Bed turned each night.Cleaned spotlessly every day.Breakfast - every option you can imagine! Sofia Sofi and the team were superb! Very attentive and lovely to go with it. First class!Ate dinner in the restaurant - again first class food, excellent setting and staff to match.The sister restaurant across from the hotel provides the same food and staff again were excellent - we made some good friends whilst we were there and were made to feel special and extremely welcome each time we visited.We decided to take a visit to the town. The hotel offered to call the hotel taxi service a Mercedes turned up - not quite the taxi we expected and was a lovely touch.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and we will certainly be back as soon as we can!   Room Tip: Jacuzzi suite overlooking the pool was spectacular See more room tips",1
"It was literally next to the beach where we just chilled and relaxed. The rooms were also very nice, the sea and beach view was breathtaking, and the jacuzzi bath tub was a bonus. All staff were very friendly and nice, especially one of the girls who worked at the breakfast louge and of course Aphrodite at front desk. It was a perfect stay !",0
"Petinos Beach Hotel exceeded all our expectations! The friendly, helpful staff made our stay a great one. It was our first trip to Mykonos, and this is a perfect place for couples to stay in Platis Gialos. Would recommend to anyone 100%! Thank you Petinos!",0
We stayed here for 8 nights and had a fabulous experience The staff were friendly helpful and a delight to deal with Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff including the breakfast staff we happy people The rooms are simply furnished but it works for the environment and gives a cool fresh feel We had rooms in the reception side of the hotel which think is preferable to overlooking the restaurants A good experience all round,0
"Travelled in mid May to Platys Gialos and the Petinos Beach Hotel - first time on Mykonos (but visited other Greek Islands many times). The hotel is about 4km from the airport and is split across two sites within just a few metres from each other. Both are beach front and have adjoining restaurants. We stayed at the main one (with the reception and not the pool). Rooms are a good size and some have views of the gardens. Reception is spacious and has a bar. The restaurant attached to this location hosts a lovely buffet breakfast - everything you could hope for both hot and cold - spoilt for choice. We used the restaurant bar on a couple of occasions before heading down the strip for food but we also ate in the hotel restaurant one evening. We can highly recommend the food - great menu and very reasonably priced - delicious sea food options - the lobster pasta was amazing! The staff throughout the hotel are worth a mention - friendly, helpful and happy! There's a pizza bar for takeaway and the other restaurant across the street was great too - we also ate here for lunch on one of the days whilst we used the ample sized pool, which has plenty of sunbeds. All in all, given the reasonable price and superb location (literally 30 seconds to the beach and nearest grocery/souvenir shop), we were delighted with Petinos - I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here.",1
The room was very comfortable. The hotel is right on the beach and close to great restaurants. The bus stop is a minute walk from the hotel and provides easy access to other parts of the island. The staff was very helpful and friendly.   Room Tip: Get a sea view room with a balcony. Worth the little extra. See more room tips,0
"We have stayed at the Petinos Beach Hotel a number of times. It is a relative good location on a beach.We booked an upgraded room with a view. This is an expensive property for US travelers. Over US$400 per night.Our first room was in the building across the street from the lobby area. It was in the same building as the Blue Myth Greek Restaurant…part of the Petinos Beach syndicate. Our room was somewhat as expected. Tiny. Shower and wash sinks in the same room as the bed. Clean. Our disappointing “view” was a balcony over-looking a very busy street. (Broken promise) We checked in about 7:00PM when the bellman turned on the air condition unit. It is HOT in Mykonos. Our room was very HOT. We went to dinner. At 9:30 PM we came back to our still HOT room. At 10:30 the music from the restaurant was pounding, pounding, pounding in our HOT HOT HOT room. (Broken promise)I went to the reception desk to get a different room. She said she had no other rooms. She said there was no one who could look at the air conditioner. She promised the music would stop around 11:00. At 11:15 I went back to the reception desk as the music POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING continued along with HOT, HOT, HOT. (Broken promise) I wanted to trust Petinos Beach Hotel to provide a fun cool and quite place to sleep. Instead we got a HOT, POUNDING, STREET room. The receptionist shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing she could do.At 11:30 after unsuccessful sleep efforts in a HOT HOT HOT POUNDING POUNDING POUNDING tiny expensive room I went to restaurant and found the manager. About six waiters and staff people were dancing to the POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING. I told the manager I was trying to sleep. I was told the music would be off at 11:00. I was firm. The POUNDING POUNDING POUNDING continued well past 11:45. I was more firm with the new reception person at 11:30. Our room was NOT what was promised for US$400. He said he would move us to the Bridal Suite located in the same building. He said we would not be charged for the night and that we could spend all three nights in that room. Two long hours later the Bridal Suite room was finally cool enough to sleep. The next morning, the receptionist said they had a room for us in the main building. We HAD to move. (Broken promise). The room was a less impressive room compared to the original HOT POUNDING one. It had a view if you moved your neck just right from the small balcony. The air conditioner worked.At check out, yet another receptionist presented me with a bill for three nights at the original room charge. (Broken promise x 2) We had a lengthy discussion until I asked to speak to her supervisor. The unapologetic supervisor said she saw nothing wrong with a hot loud room and we needed to pay up. I explained that was not what their night receptionist told us. She said he had no authority to promise us anything. Amazing. After extended discussions, a slight discount was provided. This is an UNTRUSTWORTHY establishment that breaks promises and fails to appreciate the basics of a cool quiet place to sleep. There are many other good ethical property owners. Spend your hard earned dollars with them and get a good night's sleep.   Room Tip: Try to get a quiet cool room if you like that in an expensive small room See more room tips",1
"Our group of nearly 20 people, mostly college students studying overseas, with their huge bags were greeted with such kindness and hospitality. The bartender/bell man worked so hard that afternoon. Sorting out bags, making fresh juices to welcome everyone, etc.The rooms were simply decorated and very comfortable. No need to overdo it when the location is so incredibly stunning. The included breakfast at the adjoining restaurant was delicious and satisfied everyone's varying appetites.Many things to do all over the island. We rented 4-wheelers and explored some of the more local beaches. Very worthwhile and fun. My 7 year olds loved it! We will be back.",0
"Very nice hotel to stay in and relax, chill out while in Mykonos. Its located just beside the beach with a great view! The rooms are very nice and comfortable! Breakfast served at the adjacent Blue Myth restaurant is excellent! The staff are very warm and friendly! Will choose it again if i come back to Mykonos!   Room Tip: First floor rooms are recommended See more room tips",0
A good hotel close to two beautiful beaches where you can make a meal in a restaurant on the sea with a fabulous view. However in August the prices are very expensive for the quality / price ratio because it pays like a super five-star despite being a good hotel.Facilities: This is goodPersonal: Some friendly others notBreakfast: For the price should be betterQuestion: repeated? Perhaps though there next best options.,0
"Spectacular beach front hotel! We had a room with a balcony overlooking Platis Gialos beach and it was breathtaking. The service and accommodations were all 5 star. There were plush bathrobes and slippers in the room, and very nice toiletries offered. The hotel, both inside and outside, was spotless. The concierge was very helpful and made a dinner reservation in Mykonos Town for us. The hotel is also a close walk to Ornos beach, which is by far the best beach on the island. The breakfast buffet had lots to choose from and was plentiful and delicious. Pentinos is my number 1 choice of hotel to stay at in Mykonos.",1
"Of course, your on Mykonos, everything is really expensive and full of tourist traps...We've traveled for over 1 month all over Greece (including more than 2 weeks of road trip throughout Peloponese) and our favorite hotel was the Petinos Beach Hotel!Our room was great, big size and quiet.The staff made the big difference: really kind and at our service at all time.Panos, the restaurant manager is just amazing. I rarely do so, but I strongly recommend to eat at the hotel restaurant: fresh fish is a must, one of the greatest I've eaten in Greece.",1
"We had wonderful 5 days at Petinos Beach hotel from 17 june until 21 june 2016 ,starting with the gorgeous smile of Aphrodite waiting at the reception desk until the very last person of the hotel we had a superb time. The hotel room had a spectacular beach view with an amazing far distance view if the docked yachts.The food was extremely delicious and the restaurant employees were very kind and helpful with us. We highly recommend this hotel for everyone who seeks nice place on Mykonos......Marija , Pero and Kalina   Room Tip: delux room with sea view See more room tips",0
"Petinos Beach Hotel was a great choice for our trip to Mykonos. I stayed with 5 of my friends (3 rooms) in June 2016. The hotel shuttle was waiting for us when the ferry docked. Upon arrival, we were blown away by the beauty of this beach and hotel! The front desk was extremely helpful in answering all our questions, and confirming dinner reservations for us. The restaurant attached to the hotel was just breathtaking, right on the beach. Probably one of the best parts of our stay was our complimentary breakfast each morning. A great selection, freshly squeezed O.J., and very helpful waitstaff. We enjoyed several water sports while on the beach, with a wide selection of restaurants and bars, and were also able to take a water taxi to Super Paradise Beach just steps away from the hotel. Thank you Petinos Beach Hotel!!!",0
The hotel was beautiful and all of the staff was extremely attentive. The views from all parts of the hotel are beautiful. The staff always went out of their way to help. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. Most rooms have some type of outside seating area. The complimentary breakfast was great and our lunch of freshly caught fish was excellent.The hotel is centrally located. Looking forward to visiting again.,0
"We had an apartment room for a couple and it was just beautiful. The bathroom was incredible with two basins and a washing machine. It also had wine glasses which was a step above plastic or glass tumblers elsewhere. The breakfast was amazing! Wifi was ok - a little slow, but aircon was fantastic. No lift available for the flight of stairs but we are able to carry our luggage quite easily. Lovely and quiet in the apartment area.   Room Tip: The apartment section See more room tips",0
We stayed for 6 nights although we only booked for 3. Upon check in we were upgraded to a nice garden view room. This a well run hotel thanks to some hard working employees. Only suggestion would be to have a little more variety on the breakfast buffet. As mentioned before the location is perfect for the beach and there is a city bus to town frequently.,0
"My husband and I stayed here a few days & everything was perfect. The hotel is beautiful & room is perfect with everything you need. We had a perfect pool & beach view and we were just steps from the sand. Breakfast was amazing as described, with fresh squeezed orange juice, crepes, a fresh fruit bar, Greek yogurt bar, eggs scrambled, poached, or boiled, and several other food options. We borrowed a universal plug outlet from the front desk to keep our devices charged, and were picked up & dropped off from the port where we arrived from the ferry.",0
"We stayed for seven nights with half board. On arrival we received an excellent reception with personal service and a glass of champagne. Our room, with balcony overlooking the sea, was fabulous. Breakfast buffet was in the Thea restaurant with exemplary service and lovely food. Dinner was in the Blue Myth with varied set menu, large portions and friendly service. The bus stop is right next to the hotel and the journey to Mykonos town (Chora) takes 10 minutes. We walked along the coastline track to the Paraga and Paradise beaches with stunning scenery on the way.   Room Tip: We had room 118 on the second floor with large balcony and fantastic views.

"This hotel is very nice, with very friendly and helpful staff, who will go out of their way to help and advise on things to do/see. It is in a nice area with some restaurants and bars on the beach. Not full of youngsters but a good mix of ages! Pool area is nice, rooms are very modern (bathroom could do with an update) but it was extremely clean and a great experience! The lovely ladies on reception were most polite and helpful, as well as George who welcomed us from the bus and took our luggage. There are 3 different Petinos Hotels here - this one is the Beach Hotel and closest to the front. There is a bus to Hora (the centre) that runs every half hour, last one returns at 0100, 1.80euro per person, so ideal location to stay on the beach then easy to get to town!The party area of Paradise is about 10 mins away and 15euro in a taxi.I would definitely stay here again!",0

Came here with my wife for our hooneymoon. It was really good. Greek night was amazing. Close to 2 major beaches. Fantastic food. water sports etc. free shuttle to and from the port or hotel. Staff were really helpful. Clean rooms. Deff will be back,0
"Everything, to staff from room was amazing! The super friendly staff is great, the rooms are clean, luxurious and have everything we need and more. I had a truly amazing break from life there! I stayed in a room with balcony and view to the Aegen See. I saw some beautiful sunsets there. The hotel stays 10 minutes by car from the center.",0
"Upon arrival we were greeted at the airport by private hotel transfer and swiftly landed at the Petinos Beach hotel with a glass of champagne waiting in reception in preparation for our 11 night stay.The location is just wonderful you are literally steps from the beach and steps from the pool which overlooks the beautiful Pilatos Gatos bay.The bedroom was very chic and comfortable albeit the bathroom not being separate but the size of the shower and design outweighs this minor issue! Each rooms seems to have a balcony/terrace which overlooks the pool/sea. The staff of the hotel in particular front of house (Aphroditas) and restaurant (Sofia) were just exceptional they made our stay so pleasurable. The service from Sofia and the breakfast and dinner team (Thea and Blue Myth) was so special and made us laugh all the time! I have never seen so much choice of eggs, fruit, hot dishes, continental and health foods available and to such a high standard. Both Blue Myth and Thea were top notch and we ate at regularly rather than travelling to Mykonos town as the quality of food and service differed greatly!I honestly cannot wait to return to this hotel for a further Mykonos holiday...",0
"I like a lot the room which is just in the corner that means i can have nice ocean view from our room!Meanwhile, the room and the house are just cute and so are the colors.Unfortunately, the jacuzzi can't work well once i want to use it. When i turned down it, the water become very dirty. I think there is something wrong with water hole of jacuzzi. A little disappointed about this.....",0
"We chose a standard room with a small balcony and sea view. Room was clean and pleasent but rather small. The bathroom was NOT separate, but this seems to be the new fashion. Excellent buffet with choice of Continental, Greek or English breakfast.Staff very helpfull and professional. Free transfert from airport.",0
"We where stay at may 16, for 4 nights. The hotle is amazing, big and very clean rooms. The service are wonderful, check with you twice a bay if you need any thing and that all good. Vasia and apurodite from the reception help as alot and they are very kind, always here when you need them. Kostas the belboy olso help as alot to find thing around the hotle and is really great person always with smile",0
"My wife and i stayed from the 3rd of may to the 6th of may, Awesome hotel with really helpful and knowledgeable staff. The moment we checked in till the moment we checked out the staff was really hospitable. Special mention to the front office Ms Vasilisa (Hope i have spelt the name right) really a pleasure to interact with. Hotel has really good views, the breakfast was really nice with a good spread. The waiting staff was really attentive, kind and friendly. Will come again for sure !!!Thanks",0
"Exellent location , great people, wonderfull view, confortable rooms , it was everythink perfect. The distance to the beach was incredible. The center of the island was really near. The breackfast was very complete",0
"This beach resort area is great place to relax and enjoy views of the ocean. Petinos Beach resort hotel is well positioned in area where you can walk a few minutes to restaurant Avlio tou Thodori. Excellent food and staff. Hotel very clean, spacious rooms and many with sea views. Reception staff very helpful. Shuttle outside hotel into Chora town.",0
"My family and friends stayed in Hotel Petinos beach from May 6 2016 to May 9 2016 . I had booked the hotels for the first time after reviewing hotels on Tripadvisor. It was the best decision I have made .Right from confirming that the rooms were booked in our name to confirming complimentary pick up and drop from the port , they were very prompt in resolving every issue by mail . The hotel is right on the beach and rooms on the first floor have the best view of the waters , Two families who had booked the junior suites were given huge ground floor rooms which had no view of the beach but the huge balconies opened directly in the swimming pools which the kids enjoyed jumping into.The best assets of the hotel is not the view but the amazing staff , five out of five for the staff especially in the reception , they are extremely hard working and any problem you are facing becomes whole heartedly their problem too , Ms Aphrodite and Ms Vasia ( I hope I have got it right ) kept calling the ferry companies and various agents till the last minute to ensure that we got onto our ferry as we were in the middle of a four day sudden union strike . A note of appreciation also for Angelo who served us lip smacking lunch on the first day , and always welcomed us with a warm smile everytime we walked in or out of the hotel. Choice during breakfast is varied and employees were helpful in enough to get us omelettes made the way we have it in India .The rooms of the hotel are huge and nicely decorated , views from the first floor balcony as well as outside the hotel lobby keep your camera busy",1
Loved this hotel- everything was fantastic. Small beach but nice to be away from Mykonos town. There is a shuttle which goes to town several times a day so this wasn't a problem. Great views in room 201 of the sea- the beach and the pool. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Service was faultless!,0
"I went around the Greek Islands and this was by far the best and most luxurious hotel. The place is very modern and has a chic feel. The beds are very comfortable with great pillows (so many flat pillows in hotels but these ones were so nice with good support). Bathroom is huge and spacious with lots of mirrors and good lighting. The shower is amazing (when you're traveling around the Greek islands you really appreciate a good shower, seeing as most are just tiny)! Loved the luxury bath products as well (bought some in duty free on the way back)! The entire room was just so nice and complimented the overall vibe of Mykonos. Staff were lovely and always helpful. Pool area was so cool - outdoor lounges and bean bags. I didn't want to leave. Oh and there's very good wifi - that's very rare in Greece. Highly recommended.",0
"Rooms are incredible, large, and spacious. Bathroom was awesome. Balcony was outstanding. They picked us up promptly from the airport at no charge and also dropped us off at the port for our ferry on the way out. The concierge was amazing. They helped us rent a car, arranged travel, and offered great advice on activities. It's located on the waterfront and offers an amazing view. This place is a gem!",0
"Very nice hotel near a trendy beach in Mykonos. The room and bathroom were very small, but there was a nice balcony that opened up onto the street that led to the beach. No parking at the hotel, and finding street parking was somewhat of a chore. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, so a car was probably not necessary. Platys Gialos Beach was very trendy, and the sand felt like it was man-made, or brought in from somewhere else. There are nicer beaches in Greece. The breakfast buffet was very nice. A decent option for visiting Mykonos.",0
Best hotel I've ever stayed at. We were greeted with a small pour of champagne when checking into the hotel. Maria at the front desk was delightful and extremely helpful with activities and where the hot spots were. Spiros was so pleasant and patient while hauling our super heavy luggage up the stairs...I felt bad!!! The rooms were clean and remodeled in 2014. We loved the hotel so much that we headed back after visiting Santorini. We are even planning a trip for next year it was that perfect.,1
"Just yards from the beach and restaurants, but away from the late night partying, is this very nice and comfortable hotel with many amenities, including an excellent restaurant. To go into town 10-15 minutes away, just board a local bus a few yards from the hotel. Very easy and direct. Hotel staff are extremely helpful and accommodating. Would definitely return. Highly recommended!",1
Possibly the best beach hotel I've stayed at. You honestly cannot beat Greek hospitaility. The people and food were amazing from check in to check out along with directions and insight and information which was top notch. We both found Giovanni in the restaurant was a great help and I'll def try to be back and see more of Mystical Mykonos.,1
Loved our visit to Petinos Beach Hotel. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Location is great. Breakfast and pool bar service is fantastic. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Cannot fault it. Lovely visit.,1
"This hotel was fabulous! The views were absolutely stunning, a few meters from the beach, several opportunities for dinner and bars nearby, great food, amazing staff, and anything you could think of! We rented a quad and were able to beach hop-- the staff was able to provide a lot of good information regarding beaches and good places for dinner! The location of this hotel is SPOT ON! We had a lovely honeymoon! Thank you so much Petinos Beach Hotel!   Room Tip: We had a balcony with a beach view See more room tips",0
"This is a lovely , lovely hotel overlooking the sea with steps down to the beach . It has been newly redecorated and the rooms are a mixture of comfort with style . Lots of luxurious shampoos and goodies and a truly excellent shower . The Hotel undersells itself as I booked a standard room and it was large , comfortable & very good , Better than superior rooms elsewhere The staff are lovely and super - kind professional, fun and helpful . Thank you Maria and Katerina . Nothing was too much trouble . The breakfasts are good overlooking the seaI arrived feeling grey and tired and old and left feeling chilled, happy and refreshed . So much more than a hotel .Thank you .",0
"This was our favourite place that we stayed at in all of Greece! The hotel is beautiful and has all the comforts and amenities that you could want. The staff is amazing and everyone is so friendly and helpful! The breakfast was great with lots of different options.The location is the best, right on the beach. This was the perfect place to start our honeymoon and we look forward to returning for another visit!",0
"What a fabulous hotel!Best location with stunning views, only a few steps away from the beach, watersports, watertaxis, great restaurants, supermarket and bus stop. The staff are so friendly and welcoming, they create a happy, family atmosphere whilst providing very efficient and helpful service. Great rooms and pool area and restaurant.So blessed.Look no further, GO HERE!",0
"From the airport transfer to the time we left, we had an absolutely amazing time. The staff was the kindest and most helpful of any hotel that I have every stayed. Maria is the best! She helped us with anything and everything we needed.The location is right on the beach. Mykonos can get very windy, and Petinos Beach seemed to be one calmest. The bus to Mykonos Town is a few steps out front. The bus took about 15 minutes and was around 2 Euros each way. One day we did a 30 minute walk to Paradise Beach. It had some interesting bars and clubs, but I personally liked the beach at Petinos better. There are several great restaurants. Avli Tou Thodori was my favorite, and Greek Night at Blue Myth was a close second. The breakfast was included in the rate, and it was also very good.This hotel was definitely a great choice for Mykonos, and I highly recommend it!   Room Tip: The view from the upper floor rooms is amazing See more room tips",1
"We visited for 5 nights in September and found this location and hotel to be excellent. All the staff we had contact with were incredible so thanks Maria, Spiros, Drosia, Katerina and our room attendant for your warmth. The breakfast was extensive in choice and delicious. We had 2 meals in Blue Myth restaurant connected and it was excellent food and service.The poolside was great and wind prprotected.",1
Had an absolutely amazing stay at the wonderful Petinos Beach! Everything from the moment we arrived was perfect and we felt totally spoilt! A massive thanks to the wonderful Vasia who's welcoming and friendly service was exceptional and always with her beautiful smile! All the staff were great but we wanted to particularly praise Vasia! We can not wait to return. Thankyou Petinos Beach for a perfect holiday! x,0
We had 5 nights at the petinos beach hotel in sept. Everything was spot on from the time we arrived and the hardworking staff were very friendly and helpful - particularly the girls in the restaurant at breakfast. Fantastic location close to beach and restaurants as well as the bus stop and boat jetty. Greek night at the blue myth was great fun!,0
"The Hotel is wonderful at a great spot with amazing view! We were lucky to have been upgraded to one of the nicest suitesIt is located just short ride away by the shuttle to Mykonos town, with a frequent schedule almost all day and night longWe had a great time also thanks to the super helpful and friendly stuff, who treated us like Family. Especially Maria and Vasia from the Reception were there for all our questions around every topic Have to also mention the perfect service from the housekeeping, anything we asked for came in no time, unlike some other hotels were you wait and wait.. There are so many breathtaking beaches very closebye, even the one just in front of the Hotel is so nice, that you would not even need any other oneOverall the week we stayed went by too quick, and Mykonos is surely worth another visit again soon, and Petinos always the place to stay in Semra/Sibel/Fatos- Zurich, August 2015",0
"The room was very spacious, clean, and well appointed. It was just as described on ad. Only steps from the beach. Pool area was clean and very comfy. Bed was amazing. Loved everything about it. The breakfast was fantastic. Katerina and Drossia called us by name after our first introduction. We ate at the restaurant several times other than breakfast, and everything was just perfect. The main thing that stands out in my mind and why i so highly recommend this hotel is the service. The drivers who transferred us to and from the port (Spyros and Christos) were the epitome of excellence. Spyros was waiting for us with his sign and i felt like he recognized me. He took everything from there and all we had to do was relax. Same service on the trip back. When we arrived Vassia recognized my voice from speaking to me on the phone the night before. She and Kyriakos had fresh cool towels for us. They took our bags, check in was easy, she walked us to our room and showed us where everything was. Maria and Vassia were always available to answer questions and help with whatever we needed.",0
"This is literally the best hotel we've ever stayed in. If you can splurge then definitely stay here. The staff is friendly. Rossy was so cordial and got to know everyone in our group. The breakfast is amazing -- it's almost worth it to stay here for the breakfast alone. They have yogurt, crepes, eggs, bacon, cereal, greek pastries, juices, coffee (prepared many different ways at your request), and lots more. The free wi-fi is blazing fast and if you are an American you'll be surprised that this island hotel has faster internet than your home. It's literally 10 times faster than I'm used to. I'm a photographer and I was able to backup a 30 MB image to the cloud in about 5 seconds. It sounds geeky but it gave me peace of mind backing up all my images each night. The amenities and rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The king size bed was a cozy palette of dreamy soft goodness. My only complaint is that our room needed a few more hooks on the wall near the bathroom for hanging up towels and clothes. But everything else about this hotel is perfect!",0
We stayed here for 3 nights from 18 September 2015 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Maria and Vessa at reception couldn't do enough for us. Katarina in the breakfast room was friendly and very attentive. Location was amazing and right on the beach and the room was exactly as depicted - wouldn't hesitate to recommend There is a bus stop metres from the hotel and the bus takes you into Mykonos Town and Little Italy for €1.80.,0
"This Hotel has at all !!! First time for us at Mykonos and it will definitely wont be our last . Starts with that, the Hotel is a few steps away from a gorgeous beach, and there is a shuttle service that can take u every where ( airport pickup , beaches near by, the city of Mykonos and much more ) u need to go ( although we rented a car ) until 03:00 am !!! There is amazing breakfast served with a beautiful view to the ocean , great pool, fantastic location , supermarket outside the Hotel, great restaurants of the the hotel to eat dinner , free Wifi, seriously what more can you ask ?! well all of that wont be worth without the amazing , superb service that we received from the staff !!!So i just wanna say Thank You So Much To : The lovely Katerina for always welcoming us with big smile at the breakfast area u r amazing !!! To Rossy which always helped us with great places to go and stuff to do! To the 2 amazing laddies at the Front Desk : Maria that from the beginning welcomed us with a big smile and basically helped us with anything we had to . Viska as well was so sweet and such a good help with everything as well ... And to the last one but not least to the generous Spirous that basically was everywhere from the breakfast area to the help at reception he was absolutely superb with everything !!! so we just wanna say a big thank u to all of u guys, because without you it would have definitely wouldn't be the same!!! we had so much fun and will definitely come back again . Thank U So Much !",0
"This hotel is in a great location! Right by the beach and steps away from the bus taking you to town. Stay here!We stayed in the honeymoon suite, which was so luxurious. It had a huge private terrace and balcony with 4 loungers and a large hot tub. The hot tub is a little old but very nice still. Maria at reception is absolutely wonderful. She spent nearly 30 minutes with us at check-in describing the area and giving us some very helpful tips. When we checked out, it was like saying goodbye to a good friend. Breakfast at the hotel was the only mediocre thing about the hotel. The service at breakfast was lovely, as was the view. But the food itself was only ok. Housekeeping was really attentive. Although we never saw them, our room was always cleaned and tidied up at least twice a day (full cleaning during the day and turn down with fresh towels at night). We will never need to find another hotel in Mykonos. This is our place for all of our visits.",1
"I stayed at this hotel two summers ago and at the time, I did not think it could get any better. I could not have been more wrong. This time surpassed my high expectations even more so!The hotel itself is a dream. It is situated steps from the beach and the views from the room and pool are breathtaking. The restaurant, Thea, at the hotel is delicious and comes highly recommended. It is the staff, however, that makes this hotel a gem. Maria at reception is AMAZING. Every request we had, she fulfilled with a smile. She made all of our dinner reservations and every restaurant we dined at was excellent. She even went above and beyond and scheduled a private boat for the day for our group which was one of the most memorable experiences of the entire trip.Thank you so much for the incredible stay at your beautiful hotel. We will for sure be back next summer. Until then, we will miss you xo",0
"It is a very nice hotel in Platis Yalos. We had an easy access to other beaches in Mykonos by boat. Very romantic and amazing view... Good food, polite staff, very clean room. Hope to travel again next summer!",2
"I would highly recommend this resort to anyone traveling to Mykonos. The rooms were very spacious and beautiful. The staff was amazing. They just could not do enough to make your stay more perfect. The hotel is on the water at one of the nicest beaches and is surrounded by many excellent restaurants rated highly by trip advisor. The breakfast every morning, overlooking the water was like a picture and the food was amazing We had a family of four and had two rooms connecting, one with a king size bed and the other one with two beds. There was plenty of room for everyone. We were here for 4 nights which was perfect. We will definately recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mykonnos. We had no problem with the free wi-fi. Thank you to the management and staff for exceptional customer service. We will never forget your kind hospitality!",0
Excellent hotel right on the beach with an excellent restaurant. Staff were friendly and the rooms very clean. The location is amazing and day trips on speedbaots from the pier to local surroundings on the doorstep.,0
This was perfect place to stay when u visit Mykonos. They had 3 different hotels in the area which was run by same company.The location was very close to the beach and taxi boat which was very accessible when u decided to go on beach hopping. We stayed at an apartment close to kamari hotel and it was a brilliant place. The breakfast was amasing. Staffs were really helpful and very attentive. Highly recommended.,0
"I can't recommend this hotel enough, I stayed here for 7 nights at the end of August. The staff were delightful at all hours of the day and extremely helpful and hospitable. The location is great, a few steps from the beach and the Bus that goes into town, or alternatively 10 miniutes on a quad bike, alternatively there is a boat that can take you to any of the beaches. The view from the room was also beautiful.   Room Tip: Room 202 had a lovely view over looking the pool, beach and was high up so was more private than som... See more room tips",1
"We loved staying at Petinos! The staff was so friendly and very accommodating. As soon as we arrived, Spirros helped us to our room and Maria made reservations to all of the places we wanted to visit. The hotel is right on the beach and you can take a taxi boat to all of the other beaches from there. The hotel restaurants were delicious too! My fiance and I split a large fish for lunch one afternoon and it was the best food we had on Mykonos! They also provide a buffet breakfast every morning, which was amazing. Katerina was a great waitress and had our frappe's ready for us every morning.",0
"We are two very good friends that we came for our first vacation in Mykonos, and we discovered a paradise.the hotel is amazing the stuff are very helpful and have great service  the rooms are big very clean and refresh the breakfast very good andtheres big options to choice We want to personally thank to Maria and vieska (hope that we spell the name right) from the front desk for their help and wonderfull service Which made us feel that we are in warm and loving homethey help us a lot and always recommend us for good and intresting Attractions in the islandAnd even if the reception was full of people they knew to treat each one individually and give the best service .

"My husband & I stayed for 6 nights at Petinos Beach Hotel. Lovely hotel & all the staff were absolutely amazing, they bent over backwards to attend to our every need & did it with sincerity. We would highly recommend this hotel to all! Thank you once again guys for making our little get away more pleasurable!!!",0
"The hotel is very comfortable, with a wonderful view to the sea. It is easy to reach Platys Gialos beach but also some other beaches. and excellent service both in the Hotel and restaurant. The service was excelent,nice people: they suggested us restaurants, they provided us tickets for a trip in Delos and they organised the transfer from and to airport. It was the first time and we had a great holiday... I really suggest this Hotel!   Room Tip: Sea view room are excellent See more room tips",0
"Recently returned from five nights at Cavo Tagoo. This place really is luxurious with great attention to detail throughout. On arrival we found we had been upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite with a fantastic sea view. The service is great throughout the hotel. I would imagine that at peak season it would be difficult to get a sunbed by the pool but we were there in June so it was not an issue. The breakfast and daytime snacks and meals were delicious. We never got round to using the restaurants in the evening as the hotel runs a free shuttle into and out of town at all hours. A few negatives would be the absolutely awful piped music around the pool in the daytime which appeared to be a continual loop of ""hip"" cover songs which were OK for the first 20 minutes but really irritating after that. Also the housekeeping is a little hit and miss. The biggest issue was that we were next to a large family room where for our first three nights the family played deafening music into the night which the hotel staff clearly do not monitor. However these are small gripes overall so I would rate the place as excellent",0
"what an amazing experience! location is magic, everyone is so friendly and professional! very expensive but it deserves it! amazing service, amazing view, fancy people all over the world and an experience that anyone should live. one of the best hotels in myconos by far.",0
"Checked in August 4 for 5 nights. Arrived early from Athens. Room not ready but they kindly stored our luggage.Front Desk : The young woman checking us in was not personable at all. No offer of water ,coffee or juice. Just a rather bored ,indifferent attitude.Received a call around 1230 suggesting we take a room with an outdoor jacuzzi for the first night which we would have to vacate by 12 noon the next day and they would store our luggage until our assigned room was ready. We declined as we had been travelling for days and wanted to unpack and did not want to have to carry our valuables, passports etc to the beach the next day. It was not as if we were going to get our room at 12 noon the next day we would still have to wait around for a room.Retrospectively though we should have done that. We were called around 230pm to indicate our room was ready, however arriving at the hotel the front desk gal ignored us and upon enquiry rather brusquely said the room was still not ready. Then why call us?The room we were assigned 421, has got to be the worst room on the property.When booking almost a year ago I specifically requested NOT the 4th or 5th levels as the elevator goes to the 3rd floor only.Its on the top floor and is a connecting room with no insulation around the door and I suspect its a single connecting door as we could hear the neighbours cough, switch TV channels ,turn the AC on and off etc. On our last night we had to deal with guests from he!! . Screaming ,schreeching kids .Noise till 130am. The only positive was that it had a decent view. At over $1400 per night I expected better.Pool: awesome sunset view. No shade.Staff at the pool. lounge ,breakfast and Kiku were excellent. Food was great as well.Housekeeping: Poor. Staff are unskilled, untrained and unsupervised. Rooms were never fully stocked. I had to ask for a shower cap every single day. We only got facetowels once.One morning at 9am with the DND sign on we got a knock at the door asking if we were done. I suggested she come back in 20 minutes . Upon returning at 7pm the room was not cleaned.Turndown was nonexistent ,surprising for a 5 Star hotel where one of the major daytime activities is going to the beach.One afternoon I asked them to come back as we were getting ready and they proceeded to put a notice on my door that I refused turn down that evening !!! Instead of providing evening service, housekeeping would sneak in during the afternoon and leave the weather report for the next day so as to avoid refreshing up the bathrooms later.On the morning of August 8, I left the DND sign on and headed down for breakfast. En route I encountered a houskeeper who brought a robe up to our room previously.She asked which room we were in so she could clean. I did not provide her the room number and specifically told her NOT to clean as I needed to shower.On the way back from breakfast I saw her again and this time said give me 20 mins and you can come up. She proceeds to tell me not to worry she already cleaned the room.She remembered which room from the day before!!!So despite the DND sign and me telling her not to ,she proceeded to violate our privacy by entering our room.Fortunately we do not leave valuables lying around and we had ensured the safe was locked before we left. So beware housekeeping does not understand the concept of privacy.Concierge Services : Nonexistent . Emails prior to arrival requesting transfer info and dining were not answered. After meeting her on arrival she agreed to make restaurant reservations and did not follow through as we came to find out when we presented at the restaurant. She was unable to get Beach Club reservations yet guests from other hotels had their concierge do so. Her excuse was she was trying for 3 days and couldnt get through. 2 days later at a coincidental encounter we got the same excuse.Was supposed to arrange for a car to be available the next morning around 10am . We waited for a call and eventually went to reception and got the them to call the Car Hire people. Common courtesy however would be to follow up with guests as to the status of their reservations and not wait for them to meet you by chance. Leave a message on their phones ,send an email ,a note under the door. Something ! Imo a good concierge develops a relationship with popular venues and not have excuses as to why they could not get things done.Checkout : I find it presumptous that the young lady checking us out made a point of highlighting the Tip section on the bill for Front Desk and Concierge services. Really ! I was given the most awful room and concierge service was nonexistent.Needless to say I opted not to tip.We tipped staff along the way for service provided ,but there was no way I was going to leave a tip for the substandard room and inefficient concierge. Suggest you book the beach clubs and restaurants yourselves before you arrive.Although maybe I shouldve tipped on arrival and at first meeting with the concierge and then I wouldve got my reservations done ??Overall we had a great time in Mykonos. This hotel however imo is all style no substance.If you want to have service and a similar beach holiday. Head to Byblos in St.Tropez instead.

"It was the best time ever to stay in this place . Magical i love it and the all staff was so friendly .. i dont have words to say how i feel . .it was more then excelent. love cavo tago . Specially golden villa , with the privet pool and amazing view from the living room .   Room Tip: Gold Villa See more room tips",1
"We stayed in cavo tagoo for 4 nights and it's a great choice for Mykonos.The location is perfect, as it is around 5minutes by car to Mykonos town, and the hotel provides shuttle service which u can request at your convenience (no fixed timings for departure or return) The hotel itself is very neat and clean. The rooms are beautiful and neat and all done in white. However they are not all the same. So for the same room category, you might have a shower while your friends might have a tub. Room sizes might differ as well (this is based on our comparison with friends staying at the same time). We had the premium double, it was on the 3rd floor, spacious, balcony with a very nice view, no separation between the bathroom and the room so only the mirrors separate the sinks from the rest of the room. We could reach our room directly from the elevator while those on higher floors had to go up the stairs from there. Breakfast was very good: great choice and variety and delicious. It was a buffet setting near the pool. You could also have it delivered to the room at en extra charge.Pool is great, the water was really cold but it just takes a minute to get used to. It's an infinity pool, but the road is actually right below so buses passing will be at your level but still it's not really an issue as it's still a nice setting.Staff are very friendly and helpful. And the service at the hotel was really great.The lounge chairs by the pool tend to fill up very quickly so try to get there relatively early. The only downside (but not major) was that the only meal we had at the hotel (burgers and sandwiches) was average, burger could be much much better, but still not a major thing. Overall it was a great stay, the hotel is a definite do in Mykonos due to its location and quality.",0
"How it is possible to have like this beautiful place in this world . Full with energy positive lovely people , amazing view . It was the best time ever in my life to visit this place . I would love to go back one day . Everything was just perfect . They have been so helpful friendly all the time . I was staying for 5 days in this amazing place with my friends . Our room was with privet pool , amazing view , its calling golden villa I think . I love everyone from there . Highly recommended . I don't have that many words to say how inlovee I am in this place and all of the staff. INCREDIBLE . LOVE LOVE   Room Tip: gold villa See more room tips",0
My girlfriend bought me a massage here for my birthday a couple weeks ago. The massage it self was very good but the facilities were nowhere near what I was expecting. We arrived around 20 mins early and we were brought down the hall to an open locker area where they said we could use the sauna and steam room. They did not off us any towels or robes and told us we could change in a small room (that did not have working lights. There was also a couple of matainence men walking back and for talking loudly and making our experience very uncomfortable. After the massage I would have liked to relax but we felt rushed out. All that being said the massage was quite good and the staff was very friendly.,0
"We had a really lovely holiday at Cavo Tagoo. Our room was stunning and our 3 adult children had beautiful rooms as well. The public areas are casual and the pool area was very relaxing with great service. The breakfast was also noteworthy as all of the baked goods were made on the premises and the entire selection was fresh and delicious. The only thing we found irritating is how during our stay they hassled us to pay for everything more than once, called us when we were resting in our room and even approached us at the pool one day which we found unacceptable. Frankly, we couldn't understand it since we had made a large pre payment and they had our credit card on file! To be disturbed like this was not what we would expect from a hotel of this standing and in all of our travels we have never once experienced this. It was a real let down which sadly may make us rethink staying there again....",6
"If you are in your 20s with money to burn then this is the place for you. It is overpriced and even though the breakfast was superb ,the pool menu is overpriced as are the drinks. The rooms are beautiful but there are not enough pool lounges and there is no protection from the wind. There is a view of the sea but unlike the other side of Mykonos, there is no view of the beautiful yachts moored and the beaches. There is no beach and whilst the complimentary shuttle is very convenient ,it is still a walk to town at drop-off point. The music at the pool is fabulous but some of the staff have difficulty understanding English and have an arrogance about them which I found unprofessional If you are a pretentious, superficial jet setter then this will be the place for you !",0
"I must say that we were overall quite disappointed by our experience at this hotel. We stayed for 6 nights in late June early July. The most significant issue was the early morning noise from hotel staff that made it impossible to sleep after 6.30am. Unfortunately we were given a room (112) that happened to sit under the breakfast and meals area. So staff would start setting up early in the morning -dragging, banging, stomping etc. Terrible noise.Even worse were the cleaning staff who would start at 7am. These people have clearly never worked in a hotel before as they spoke to each other at the top of their lungs outside our door every morning. They would also bang buckets, slam doors, hit our door with their brooms and mops, drop things and generally make as much noise as they could. I twice had to get out of bed to yell at them.We complained every day about the noise but other than one morning it did not improve. One of the staff members agreed that the room was awful. He had been given that room when he first arrived at the hotel and he admitted that it was dreadful.There were some positive elements. I thought the bar staff were excellent. Great cocktails with beautiful sunsets from the pool area despite the passing traffic. The Japanese restaurant at the hotel is very good also. The staff were generally well meaning and helpful. The drivers were terrific. Some staff (particularly breakfast staff ) were charming but very inexperienced constantly bringing the wrong drinks to our table or taking dishes before they were finished. All of this would be tolerable if you were paying $200-$300 a night but not in a hotel that claims to be 5 star and charges in excess of $1000 a night. Just not good enough and quite frankly you would not get away with this anywhere else in the world but in Mykonos.   Room Tip: Check the room before you commit. See more room tips",3
"Beautiful sun which one can feel once one gets over the cockroaches, sleepless nights from defective pool plumbing, no hot water at peak times, suitcases and clothes reeking of mold, average food that costs a fortune, dirty towels, no beach, the main road just in front of pool, and no one to even care. I was told to change hotels. Unacceptable for over 1,500 euros per night. Just unacceptable. Don't go to this hotel. Just don't go.",2
"Was very happy with my stay here at Cavo Tagoo, great room and good staff. Can get a little loud at night with pool area being noisy but tolerable. Room was a golden villa so very pricey but worth it, ended up getting moved to larger room and was VERY happy with size and private pool. Would def recommend hotel to anyone going to Mykonos.",0
"I cannot describe it!!!!!!Stunning sea view, gorgeous service, lovely pool!From the moment we arrived, we felt well taken care of!We were treated like king & queen!5 STAR!I will come back!Thank you!",0
"The hotel transfer picked us up from the port. The hotel staff were absolutely brilliant. Patricia the concierge was superb with her suggestions, bookings and general information. The room was always clean and spacious. There is a free transfer to and from the town 24hours a day/night. The breakfasts are delicious. The swimming pool is great and pool staff very helpful. At night, the music played by the pool is also fantastic and the emote area is turned into a lounge. I highly recommend this absolute 5 star hotel and will definitely stay there again.",0
"I stayed here with my mother on our trip to Greece and we had a fantastic time. This was, by far, the most interesting hotel I had ever stayed in. Our room was beautiful with a separate bedroom and a seating area. We had two big balconies that overlooked the ocean so we could watch boats come and go. We were picked up at the ferry station and it was a bit confusing because our guy wasn't where we thought he'd be and we missed one another - we ended up having to borrow a cell phone from some nice rich European guy and his wife to phone the hotel since mine wasn't working overseas for him to come back and get us. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean and the pool deck area is beautiful - we sat out by the pool for a few hours and had lunch on the deck. My club sandwich and fries were DELICIOUS. The spa of this hotel is lovely, we were greeted upon check-in with sparkling champagne and goodies and they asked if I needed anything. I was provided with an adaptor to use in the room for charging items when I mentioned I didn't have mine anymore very promptly. The maid service is very good - our rooms were spotless and well-cleaned daily and they left little Greek honey cakes from nearby Syros on our pillows as an afternoon snack that my mom loved and asked for more of. They have an on-site jewelry store where we were given cute little bracelets as a gift to commemorate our first trip to Greece. We left feeling pampered and have thought of this as paradise ever since. I can't wait to come back.",0
"I did not stay in the hotel, but I will certainly do, when I go to Mykonos again. I only ate at the Japanese Kiku restaurant which belongs to the hotel. First, we entered the hotel through the amazing reception, all white, with a lot of design and very good taste. Then we had an excellent dinner in an amazing environment. The food was excellent, the service was more than perfect and the price was correct for what was offered. We ate overlooking the wonderful hotel pool and Hora, which is the city in Mykonos with all night lighting. Just happiness.",0
"This place was gorgeous, staff were helpful, room was amazing, breakfast was good. Overall it wasn't the best feel for a place for us, not as peaceful as we would've liked, but it seems like a great place to go if you're into the party life. Igor was amazing as a concierge.",1
"Aside from the twenty something arrogant staff and the wanna be jet-set crowd that just makes the attitude of this place completely awful, the hotel itself is gorgeous with stunning rooms, a fantastic infinity pool, good drinks, a solid menu and despite the attitude of the staff, good service. Don't go here for a romantic couples getaway. This is more of a ""scene"" type of hotel and quite frankly it's extremely over done. The location is a bit out of town but they do provide a reliable, free shuttle. The concierge named Costas is helpful. A great property but lacking in the ""human capital"" and manners department.",7
"It has the best,most romantic view, very modern luxurious interior, the great pool with sun-beds in the water.Most amazing cocktails.Great service.Clean, stylish,cool place to be.Simply feels like paradise.   Room Tip: Suits are simply amazing. See more room tips",0
"It's the best hotel in Mykonos you could ask for!!! The view is amazing the stuff are so friendly and so helpful, the pool view is so perfect and the breakfast is very good as well the only thing I didn't like is the pool can't get worm! And it's so deep more than 150 not as it written in the pool.",0
"I don't have enough adjectives to be able to adequately describe the experience at Cavo Tagoo.This was my first time in Mykonos and the entire trip was spectacular. While I haven't stayed at any other hotels in the island, it's not possible to beat Cavo Tagoo. The vibe, design and ambience is absolutely world class. But more than anything, the service sets the place apart and right up there with the very best hotels on the planet - I'm sure of it!The guests at the hotel all seemed to be enjoying it as much as we were and the crowd is most definitely travelers who have experienced incredible hotels around the world. You will be wishing for 48 hours in a day and will constantly feel cool as the friendly and warm as the team at Cavo Tagoo cannot do enough to make your stay as pleasurable as possible. It's an expensive hotel and the staff realize that and therefore do all they can to ensure you're getting value even for the expensive price tag. And they deliver 110%!If I could give this hotel 6 stars I would. Bravo Cavo Tagoo - we plan on returning to your blissful, chic, cool paradise",0
"This hotel is amazing! Perfect from the moment you step in. Very sympathetic staff, wonderful interior design and pools (private ones and in common areas) that are hard to beat. My family had an amazing time and we will definitely return! For those who are interested, I have posted many photos on my Instagram account MARINEIRA.Whatever you need will be accommodated by the guys at the reception with a big smile. Concierges know everything. Great music and party atmosphere. Another dimension! 100% recommended!",0
"Fresh out of rainy, windy London here we are finally at Mykonos Airport.We were greeted at the airport by hotel staff who drove us to the hotel. We had reserved the 'Golden Villa', a suite with 2 bedrooms, a living room and a private pool. The suite was nice and the pool of good size. The view though was amazing. During our stay, Housekeeping would reply immediately to our requests but the beds are badly made and the floors are not well swept. Pool staff appear out of nowhere without prior notice to clean the pool and that was annoying. On the other hand, Maria, our concierge was really helpful. She insisted we visit a beautiful beach ""Alemagou"" and we had the best day thanks to her. Finally, I would like to thank our hotel driver Babic who dropped us at the airport on our way back to London. He went out of his way to put us in line for check in and was extremely helpful.",3
"This was my 3rd trip to the beautiful Cavo Tagoo. The hotel is quite small with an intimate feel and is decorated in a very cool minimalistic style. There are many levels of bedrooms which are all different and individual and the price rate reflects the size and facilities. Some of the larger ones come with their own pool on the balcony. On all three occasions I have had fabulous bedrooms with views over the sea. The hotel is situated a few minutes from town and transport is provided each way, free of charge at a moment's notice, which is a huge benefit on an island with 35 taxi's! The standard of everything in the hotel is extremely high ... there is a fabulous selection of hot and cold food at the buffet breakfast. Food by the pool was equally enjoyable and the service was second to none. The pool area is quite small but during the times I have visited Cavo Tagoo (May and June), I have never struggled to find a sun bed. I would say that the hotel would suit couples, singles or families with older children. The hotel is pricey but definitely worth it and Mykonos is a fabulous holiday destination for anyone who enjoys sun, great food and stylish shopping. I will be returning!",0
"We loved this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights. Great location, just outside of downtown. They offer free shuttle to and from downtown, which was great not having to get a taxi to and home from dinner. The pool is a fun see and be seen place to be with a DJ spinning nice relaxing fun tunes. Service is excellent. We only ate by the pool and food was great! Shrimp Ceviche and Club Sandwich were stellar! We loved our room. We had 2 balconies with incredible views. Highly recommend and would definitely return.",0
"My family stayed here a week ago and it truly is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. The views is gorgeous. The pool is exquisite. The restaurant and bar are trendy and fun. Our concierge, Maria was outstanding. My only issue was lack of air-conditioning in our room. We had a 2 bedroom suite and our children's room was 30°C at night. After several phone calls, a maintenance man came to ""explain "" to us that it is a small inside room and that is just the way it is. A hotel of this caliber should not have this issue. Was disappointed is the way it was handled.",0
"2nd part of honeymoon trip was as nice as the 1st in Santorini. Fall in love with the hotel the moment we stepped in. Beautiful design , close to port and outstanding welcoming. Upgraded to a suite with private balcony and jacuzzi viewing the sea was the best place between 12 and 7 pm. Free upon need transportation to Mykonos town was also great. Breakfast buffet was one of a kind. None alcoholic cocktails, not my style, at pool bar were irresistible. Elegance and cleanness of the room was unique. Truly loved and service appreciated",0
"Black ""Diesel"" branded poolside towels was the final straw and I still can't fathom how they could get something so simple so wrong. Also, the sheets, the towels in the bathroom and so many of the small things let this place down. It's a shame because the property has all the right ingredients and if you want easy access to town and explore beaches during the day, Cavo Tagoo has lots of positives. Service was so so, lots of untrained staff who were eager to help but didn't really have a clue. Expensive as well. Would definitely return to Mykonos and definitely wouldn't stay here.",1
"Having been recommended to this hotel which, by the way, is only a 10 minute drive from the airport, we arrived not knowing quite what to expect.We were greeted by a lovely team of doormen and a 3 ladies at reception dressed as Greek Godesses. I know it sounds corney but actually it wasn't and they were so friendly and welcoming we immediately felt at home. We were shown to our rooms (We were 3 couples) and the rooms were terrific. My wife and I had been upgraded so we had a pretty huge room with a wonderful balcony.The pool is smallish but just gorgeous, an infinity pool which seems to merge seamlessly with the sea.. One small criticism is that the sun loungers do not really have adequate canopies so protection from the sun is minimal. They play great music by the pool and there are an abundance of pool staff all so willing to be helpful. Watching the sunset at the Cavo Tagoo with a lovely Negroni is pretty spectacular.Breakfast is superb and it is very difficult to fault this wonderful Hotel. My friends and I raised the average age of the hotel by a huge factor but even still we just adored everything about it.One small point - our lovely upgraded room had no full length mirror, no shelf in the shower and it was impossible to reach the bedside light controls without getting out of bed. We mentioned this in the friendliest possible way and the next day they put a full length mirror in the room and a little table by the shower to put the soap and shampoo on.This is a hotel of the highest order and we all agreed that we cannot wait to go back there.   Room Tip: Anything witha full sea view. See more room tips",7
"Our family arrived June 26, 2015 and departed June 28, 2015 (not July – sorry for the late review.)We were very impressed with the hotel, Jacuzzi and pool inside our room, beautiful ocean view, etc. Breakfast by the way IS delicious! Cavo Tagoo is probably is one of the best luxury hotel if not the best - and most expensive? - in Mykonos however, we were not too impressed with the service. Alex was very nice but when it comes to arranging transportation, there seems to be a problem with some of the staff members. Once we waited approximately 20 minutes for a taxi to take us back to the hotel. This is definitely a luxury hotel but taking into account its price, service especially in this area neeautiful hoteleds improvement.",3
We stayed at Cavo Tagoo for our recent trip to Mykonos. This hotel was beyond amazing; but you are definitely paying for it. The pool scene is awesome with good vibes coming from music and staff. The rooms were fantastic; all white everything. The room came with its own mini-pool on the balcony. While at our stay an Italian soccer player was also staying at Cavo. I knew I was at the right place when we saw him. Will I come back? Y-E-S.   Room Tip: Even the most standard room comes with bells and whistles. Do not pay the extra for ocean view. You...

"This hotel is supposed to be the best or at least one of the best hotels in Mykonos. I have been here for 5 days now and I must say I really like the hotel. But there are some things I really didn't like at all. Since I'm German and we are ALWAYS complaining I have to mention at least a few:- the main pool area is too small for the high amount of guests. I heard people actually fight over sunbeds because some very talented (supposedly German :-) people) reserve their sunbeds early in the morning and when you fool arrive after breakfast or at 12 you might be disappointed.- how is it possible that a five star hotel doesn't have any real sun protection? There aren't either cabanas nor real parasols- not on the main pool area and also not on your private terrace (with pool). I'm pregnant and I'm not allowed to stay in the direct sun (at least not when it's over 30 degrees) and I really felt bad about it. We always went to beach clubs instead (we loved Scorpios which is beautiful, tranquil and has nice and huge cabanas overlooking the sea). But why pay 750€ a night if you can only really use this hotel for sleeping? - for this high price they don't offer free water on the room. The second day we didn't have any water at all in our room (and they also ""forgot"" to fill the mini bar). Asking the main desk the first reaction was: there is only complimentary water on the first day. Not fair enough- but at least they should fill the mini bar.- today we arrived in our room in the evening and we didn't have a single towel in our room, they simply forgot. How is that possible? -they don't offer any snacks or chocolate in the room. We are in 5 star hotels all over the world all the time and I must say- is it too much asked for to leave some little snacks in the room?! And also they don't offer any plate of fruit (not at the arrival and also not after) which I think is not ok. The breakfast is quite big. But why don't they use real Nutella if the sign says Nutella? In a five star hotel I expect the real Nutella and not a cheap and not tasty version. And why are the eggs always cold? And why don't they offer fresh pancakes or French toast like every other hotel we have been to in the last years? And why is all the cheese cut into little cubes instead of slices? How is anyone supposed to make a toast with cheese which is cut like that?The breakfast is ok, but could certainly be improved. - the interior is ok but not really nice. It's quite boring and cold I must say. No nice cushions and also not nice curtains and nothing fancy at all although Greek decoration as you can see in several shops in the center is quite beautiful.That's all I have to say for now. we loved Mykonos and that is what made our stay nice and unforgettable. I totally recommend the restaurants Ling Ling (by Hakkasan) (ask to sit outside)and also Interni. Beach clubs Nammos and Scorpios. Have fun!",9
"We flew from Atlanta, Georgia to stay at this hotel based on a recommendation. As soon as I arrived, I was first welcomed by great looking employees then blown away by the architecture of the building. The employees were some of the best especially Alex at guest services. Not only did we get an incredible experience because of him we also got incredible deals on breathtaking activities! I would give this place a 4 out of 5 but I had such a good experience with the employees, Alex in particular, that I will give it a 5 out of 5 stars! Highly recommended!",0
"An amazing hotel in Mykonos, this 5 stars hotel had a very nice view and location front of the sea , our suite really beautiful we choose the one include jacuzzi and private pool , and the most important for us the toilet had hose , the bed comfortable and the breakfast was delicious and many kinds of food ..",0
"We booked cavo tagoo for a long weekend and we were very happy with our choice.The location is perfect, the hotel is beautiful, but above all the staff is the best I have ever encountered in a five star hotel. Thanks to everyone for a nice short holiday.",0
"This hotel is out of this world! It compares to nothing!Amazing view, minimal design, professional staff.Every afternoon we had our cocktails by the pool.We didnt want to leave this hotel to have a stroll at the rest of the island!!!!!!!",0
"This was the most amazing place ive stayed so far! As soon as we arrived we were greeted with warm welcomes and friendly staff. We were upgraded free of charge to the most amazing honey moon suite 613! This made our stay even more amazing and loved how the staff went out their way to help and surprised us with such a luxury room. The bar staff were so friendly offering free shots with them making up special cocktails and generally happy to help and speak with advising places to visit on the island. Service in general even room service was the best ive experienced and the hotel environment room and restaurant all matched to be a 11/10 experience! I couldn't recommend staying here even more than explained, the views are unreal and so close to the town with free taxi service that the hotel offer which was so handy even took us to the airport! The weather was slightly windy but hot at the same time, wasn't too busy but nice atmosphere. I cant wait for our next visit back already planning it!   Room Tip: Private pool room was amazing!

"First time in Greece and went with the Mrs for our 19th wedding anniversary. We weren't disappointed.We were picked up from the airport by the hotel's own shuttle.On arrival you are met by what may only be described as Greek Goddesses in flowing white apparel. They calmly explain all to you in very good English.We had a suite with a private pool and Jacuzzi - there is some story to that later.The breakfast was very nice with variety and all manner of hot or cold drinks were available and complimentary. The location itself was right over-looking the sea and felt very pleasant and classy.The bar area at night right by lounging beds and built on a glass aquarium was staffed by well versed barmen....back to the room.One advantage of the Greeks not re-invading other countries post 18th century, is that no one else speaks their language, hence all tv stations are in English! Result!The room had quite hi-tech lighting and general controls which took some figuring out.The toiletries were very different in a nice way. The shower a bit basic but the toilet though slightly bland did serve its purpose!The sinks were made out of ""slightly"" cut rock which though ""cool"" were a bit weird to use. The view from the bed of the sea made up for the impracticality of the sinks by a mile!The distance to the town was a 10 minute walk and the hotel was always happy to provide transport to and from the town at any time of the day or night.The Jacuzzi - well it looked ok till we powered it on and yes you guessed right - we had a big flood!The response was prompt and a faulty stuck valve was to blame apparently. The hotel had the room ready (after we evacuated it in a hurry!) within 30 minutes but it meant we never got to use the Jacuzzi.They did bring Prosecco and a couple of cocktails up to apologise though which did go down well.Overall I would have rated the hotel full five stars if not for the unfortunate incident of the ""attacking Jacuzzi""! If anything, it did prove that the wiring was done properly as the flood did not affect any electrics.In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel and will go back if ever in Mykonos",0

"visited in summer 2006. a bit apart from downtown but a great view and very cool ambiance. rooms are clean and well designed, with stunning pool terrace if you can afford. I only misses a quick access to beach to be unforgetable.",0
"We spent 7 days here. Exclusive, beautiful and amazing place to be centrally in Mykonos. We rented a Vespa and traveled the city. The swimming pool is beautiful and the service was worthy of this luxury hotel. Don't miss it!",0
"This is by far the best hotel around. The rooms are great, each with a different feel to them. They are quiet, comfortable and spacious. The pool area is spectacular. Great cabanas, food, drinks, and service. The breakfast buffet every morning was delicious. Its the perfect location to walk to town, and if you want they have mopeds to rent for the day. Such a great experience all the way around.",1
"Cavo Tagoo is almost in the centre of Mykonos. The rooms and services are excellent, its location is amazing and you can watch the best sunset by having a coctail in the pool area, where a fantastic aquarium bar exists or you can eat sushi at the famous Kiku restaurant. I highly recommend ths hotel for your vacation in one of the best islands in the world.",0
"6 of us traveled to Mykonos for vacation this past summer and we all stayed at CavoTago . The Roma designed, the service and the food was impeccable .When going back , we will stay there again .

"Great location, likely one of the best hotels to go with friends for a fun Mykonos trip. the property is beautiful, the sunset is gorgeous from the pool. The private pool with the room is in the shade and too cold to swim. Unfortunately the staff is a bit judgmental when you come in late from partying, which is a big part of being in that location. Otherwise great!",1
"We spend our honeymoon stay at Cavo Tagoo and we were absolutely satisfied! The hotel is an architectonical gem. It is unique not only due to its setting on the rock but due to the fact that the rock was used as an essential part of the hotel. Therefore the space is a harmonic combination of rocky formations and the Cycladic architecture. The imagination of the hotel architect is really outstanding!There is an excellent view over the sea which is most beautiful especially when the sun sets.The room was absolutely fantastic. First we stayed at junior suite with private infinite pool. The room was perfectly clean, spacious, comfortable, luxury and cosy. The design was simple and pure imitating the Cycladic architectonical patterns. What we enjoyed most was the big Jacuzzi, the small private pool and the great sea view. Later we moved to Diamond villa which was a fantastic experience. The space was splendid, elegantly designed in every detail, fully luxurious with spacious living room, kitchen, little gym, sauna and a very large private pool with great view over the sea and the lower part of the hotel. Thanks to the large sliding window the living room can be almost fully open to the pool area which amplifies the size of the space and the view is like a fantastic widescreen movie. This is probably the best room in the hotel!Even though we had an excellent large private infinite pool in our room we enjoyed the main pool area as well. There was plenty of elegant sunbeds, a lovely bar and a relaxing zone behind. The staff is very helpful, willing and nice. Each time we left our room for breakfast, the staff cleaned the room before we come back. The breakfast staff was very fast, attentive and smiling. The shuttle service between hotel and Mykonos centre was perfect. We never waited more than five minutes for the driver. The lobby staff was also very nice.The breakfast offer is very rich and well stocked. There is a wide choice of cold and warm food and a huge offer of various sweets. We liked everything we had tasted. The breakfast is served in a beautiful and relaxing space near the pool area.We really enjoyed this unforgettable place with unique atmosphere and we recommend it to everyone who want to spend a luxury stay in the architectonical work of art.   Room Tip: Diamond villa (room no. 700) is the best! See more room tips",0
"My opinion on this resort is mixed. The complex is modern and amazing however what takes a resort to the next level and 'outstanding' is the staff. This resort could learn from Andronis, Oia. This resort was the only 5 Star resort on our recent European holiday that did not send a welcome email prior to arrival. Mykonos also has approximately 30 taxis so a transfer is highly recommended and this could have been suggested in the welcome email. One of the reception staff had an attitude issue and the concierge supposedly made a restaurant reservation for 8pm when the restaurant only opened at 8:30pm. We ended going somewhere else. Not impressed. If a restaurant reservation is made for a different time to that originally agreed and noted on our map/plan, then we need to be told. I suspect that the concierge did not communicate to the reception staff effectively. Also rang courtesy driver after dinner and waited 15 mins for collection and in the end took a taxi back to the resort. The same receptionist said that the driver had been to the meeting point 3 times which is not true. I suspect the receptionist forgot to arrange with driver. On another occasion when we requested courtesy driver and were told by reception it was unavailable, as soon as we went outside to go to town we were pleasantly surprised as the courtesy driver offered us a lift. So there is a real communication issue at this resort. Other issues included- no face washers- pillows uncomfortable (need to check out what Sofitel do)On a positive note the breakfast is very good and varied and the decoration/sculptures at the complex are quirky. Noticed that someone had started the questionnaire in our room but didn't complete however I agree with their negative comments. Obviously someone else shared the same opinion as us. I think if you get the staff right the complex would be great and amazing.",0
"The service here was amazing!We had beautiful room with private plunge pool and spa. Even though we came here the last week before closing, the staff were still, even after a long season, attentive and helpful. Get the Thai massage from the spa if you like firm Thai massages.... I had 3 in 5 days...... You won't be disappointed. Heaven. The car into town, at a request was very helpful at times and reception was always so helpful 5 stars!",0
"My husband & I stayed at Cava Tagoo for 2 nights on 4th & 5th Oct. No doubt of its fantastic location & good service. But the room planning ( don't remember the no. but a large room on a higher floor with a balcony, jacuzzi ), was terrible. Firstly, the bathroom was unbelievably small & impractical. Secondly, no space was planned to keep the luggage. We had no choice but to keep them on the sofas. The heights of the desk and its chair and also the sofa & the table were totally mismatched, hence it was very uncomfortable working on the laptop. There is a lovely window above the desk but every time you need to open or shut it, you have to shift the stuff on the desk !! Same time, if you want to use the TV remote, that window shutter had to be closed else it blocked the TV !! This made the stay very frustrating !! The interior designer must have been a total novice .",2
"This hotel is uber trendy. The lobby, rooms, pool, restaurant all are to a great standard with a relaxed atmosphere everywhere. We first were taken to our 'honeymoon suite' room.... be prepared that apparently they all dont look like the pictures on the website.... our 'honeymoon suite' was not a suite, it was a room, and a pretty average one for the price too. However, we expressed our concerns to Nikos in conceirge who rapidly fixed it and moved us to the room next door which was much more like what we were expecting (apparently that was a one bed golden villa...but looked more like the pictures of the honeymoon suite online so be a bit careful if looking at these rooms) He was fantastic though as his customer service was fantastic. He really looked after us for our entire stay making sure we were comfortable in our new room and have reservations sorted etc for evening dinners, he was a real credit to the hotel. The food was fantastic, buffet breakfast had a really great choice and was always well stocked. The restaurant in the evening that did sushi was really good and would highly recommend. The hotel does shuttle cars to and from the town centre to the hotel, this is only a 2-3min car ride, however its not recommended to walk as there are no paths along the main road so can be a bit dangerous. At the end of your time in town you just call the hotel and meet and the same spot and they come and pick you up. Our only gripe with this, is of an evening it gets busy, and almost every evening we called the hotel, a car would come and other cavo tagoo guests would push in and jump in the cars ahead of you (either they didnt see other people waiting or were just plain rude) We believe the hotel would benefit from having more of a system to this arrangement and when people call for a car, the hotel take the room number of guests and then they only pick up their designated room numbers. This makes it a lot fairer and upon check in everyone is told they need to call for a car so everyone knows what the protocol is. Other than that, a lovely stay in a lovely hotel close to town.

"Where does one start about this amazing hotelfirstly it is a work of design Art the Staff are just incredible nothing is to much from the reception to the pool ,the drivers bar kitchen its just perfect However the Food was from outer space we ate in over 50per cent for dinner and lunch every pool day but to top it all was breakfast just simply beautifulThe views and sunset there is fabi am going again soon   Room Tip: one with a pool See more room tips",0
"I was originally booked at Kivotos luxury hotel in Mykonos and a few weeks beforehand I received a notice that the hotel would be closing before my arrival.They offered to place us another hotel in Mykonos but truthfully it just did not seem or feel right.My gut instinct proved to be correct after viewing the option that was suggested.After carefully researching our options,we noticed that Cavo Tagoo received many rave reviews and we decided to reserve.God must have had his hand in the selection as this stunningly beautiful boutique luxury hotel is the most romantic and comfortable place we have ever visited,worldwide.simply fantastic and sheer perfection.We were upgraded to a large villa suite with its own private pool and just about every luxury amenity and comfort that you can think of.Great views,great location,great staff,great breakfast,great bar,amazing spa and great guests.I urge you to not even think of staying anywhere else on this Island if you want to capture a slice of heaven and sheer perfection-we plan to return often and hope you experience the same.",4
"This 5stars hotel has one the most stunning locations ever, with the most beautiful view on the Sunset.The infinitypool is big and very chic, with very sophisticated furnitures and a very good service. Rooms are big, full of light and all of them have the same amazing view you get from the pool and the restaurant. Hotel is really close to the Xora therefor you can also walk there in 10 minutes. All the staff is very nice, young and goodlooking, which makes your holidays even nicer! The style is very modern, clean and minimal. If you are looking for the typical greek place this is not for you. Super Paradise and Paradise beaches are about 15 minutes distance by car/motorbike. Expensive but it is really worth it! Breakfast: best ever! Thank you Cavo Tagoo for an amazing Wedding anniversary celebration (and thanks for the upgrading - jacuzzi on the terrace was the cherry on the cake",2
"I was booked in to stay for 4 nights ended up staying an extra one. To be fair I wanted to stay longer but obviously being the amazing hotel that it is, it was full.What can I say, the atmosphere is incredible and has such a vibe! The crowd is just beautiful and the views stunning. Big thank you to Diana at the pool bar, she was such a darling and so professional! Anastasia at concierge was just the best, we had such a laugh together and alway giving me top tips! I stayed in a deluxe room with an incredible jacuzzi on the sea view balcony, insane! For my last night, the incredible manager upgraded me to a two bedroom golden villa with a massive private pool, needless to say during my whole stay at Cavo Tagoo I felt like a rockstar! Alex at the room service, you were so lovely! Can't wait to be back next year!",1
"First of all the location is perfect, the view is wonderful, the architecture of the site and the clean rooms, bright white, give the impression of entering on the Olimpus welcomed by Gods and Goddesses.The atmosphere, the pools and the restaurant in addition to the exceptional service for every thing that you might need, are a good reason to stay there every year. Looks like there is some one behind the door waiting for your call to serve you.   Room Tip: There are rooms for every ""tasty"". See more room tips",0
"I will never stay anywhere in Mykonos except at Cavo Tago! This hotel is perfect, from private pools, amazing pool, bar, and fabulous restaurant! The rooms are new, spacious and comfortable. The hotel is luxurious, young, and charming. The food is exceptional, service on another standard. Best experience ever",0
We stayed at Cavo Tagoo for 4 nights we were three couples. We were all up graded to a room with our own plunge pool. Hotel was beautiful. Views amazing. Staff could not do enough for you. Food was delicious. Hotel fit out was 5 star.,0
"How can I describe perfection? Maybe all I need to say is that it is too good to be true!I feel like if I'll try to explain why it is such a perfect hotel I'll miss some points so I'll just tell you that it is too clean, the food (no matter if it is breakfast, lunch or the Japanize dinner) is too tasty, the staff is very friendly, the music outside over the swimming pool just wonderful, the rooms are big, nice and clean! I'll say it once again a perfect hotel",0
"I stayed here during the first week of September and it was everything we were hoping for.The hotel is beautiful, the food is fantastic and all of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.The breakfast in the morning is a great start to the day and they have something for everyone. The waiters and waitresses are extremely helpful and welcoming.During the day the service by the pool is also extremely good, the staff always go out of their way to ask you how your day was, what you have planned for the week or just have a chat about life in general.In the evening the hotel makes a great night out if you don't feel like travelling into town. The Japanese restaurant Kiku is fantastic and some of the best Japanese food I have had for a long time. After dinner you can drink at the bar where the staff make awesome cocktails and are always willing to have a few shots with you which is great fun.If you do feel like venturing out during the day or in the evening then the hotel offers a constant shuttle service into town which is just a 5 minute drive. You don't need to book this, just simply head to the reception and someone will be ready to take you. After your evening is done then you simply call the hotel and they will send someone to pick up at the designated pick up point. We were never waiting for more than 5 minutes and the drivers were always friendly and helpful. If you need to venture further than town then the hotel can book private transport for you which can vary in price, the furthers we travelled from the hotel was 50 Euros each was which wasn't too bad and again, the service was friendly and punctual.We upgraded our room to have a pool on the balcony. I wouldn't say this is essential but it looks fantastic and its great in the early evening for a cool down and a few drinks. The main pool is salt water which I am not too keen on but the balcony pools are regular chlorine water which was a nice change.The rooms are spacious and clean with regular maid service which includes new towels twice a day which was very helpful.Overall I would absolutely recommend staying at Cavo Tagoo, it was an extremely relaxing week and did not disappoint.",0
"I just stayed here for 7 nights in August 2015. The property is beautiful, from the modern rooms to the amazing pool area this place is an amazing place to spend time and relax at. The price was definitely on the high end but you get what you pay for and it is one of the nicest hotels in Mykonos. Breakfast was included each day and the buffet was excellent. The only thing I didn't like is that the breakfast didn't open until 8am. On the last day we had to leave for the airport at 7:45am and when we went down we couldn't get anything to eat. When I mentioned we had to leave for the airport I was simply reminded that the breakfast doesn't start until 8am so we left hungry and had to eat at a kiosk at the airport. In the grand scheme of things, this was a very minor issue and I would still return to this property if I go back to Mykonos.   Room Tip: It is worth upgrading to a room with a view and terrace/balcony. The views were amazing and it wasn... See more room tips",0
"This is one expensive hotel that totally worths the price. Amazing view strait to the sunset, you can see the sun lie to the aegean see. In adittion it has a perfect spotted pool with sunset amazing view",0
"This is one of the first places booked for our trip to Greece and am very glad we booked here. This is one of the 'coolest' hotels we have ever stayed - to spend an afternoon around the pool is an incredible experience (great music, vibe). The hotel is expansive - all white and cool spaces, including the spacious rooms. Upon arrival we were greeted with sparkling wine and complimentary fruit and wine in our room. The whole experience of the hotel was chilled out - we had long lunches under the shade, exceptional breakfasts and delicious smoothies, cocktails and snacks around the pool. Special mention must be made of the shuttle service picking us up upon arrival and making sure we could get around Mykonos with ease. GREAT location - a walk away from the town and old and new ports. Some lovely staff members at the hotel. Only negative would be how cold the pools (main and room) were - would have loved a swim on a hot day but was icy! Would recommend to anyone",0
I've traveled quite a lot and this is the first time I make a review. My boyfriend and I went to Mykonos for our bday celebration. We stayed at one of the suites with private pool and I have to say that the room was amazing and we enjoyed a spectacular view of the sunset every day! The people from the hotel are super nice and they really know what great service and hospitality is all about. My boyfriend and I are definitely staying here again when we come back! Definitely recommend it!!!,0
"This is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at. The view is amazing, the pool is amazing, the food and drinks are amazing. Our room was to die for. The hotel is sensory overload. They also have a daily shuttle that will pick you up/drop you off from the airport, and from the city. It is also close enough to walk to the city center.",2
"Coming from Santorini this was a completely different feel. The lobby is all white with colorful art. We were greeted with a glass of champagne. The room was a junior suite so there was a very cool built in sleeping/lounging area for my daughter.Everything was pretty. Our balcony had a jacuzzi that overlooked the pool and water, like heaven.Service was excellent and Mike the restaurant manager was personable and helpful and pleasant.The breakfast spread was probably the nicest either of us had ever seen in all our travels. The hotel had a shuttle into town and that was very nice.At night the pool area was converted to a club by the pool chairs being converted to couches !.The music was so great and the infinity pool was perfect because i could stand up wherever I went..the view was really what it was about and it was spectacular.My negative is that it was very expensive. Drinks were about $18 american for a cocktail. It was a special place and very chic   Room Tip: Our room overlooked the pool and it was great and very comfortable regarding views and a/c See more room tips",0
"The hotel is located close enough to town by car, but it is probably a 15-20 minutes walk there. But the hotel has an amazing shuttle service non stop, 24 hours a day and you never have to wait for more than 5 minutes for it to go back and forth.The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. All of the people who work there are super kind, helpful and eager to please.The hotel spa is good, the treatment rooms are nice and the therapists are very qualified.The fitness room is small and could be improved.The pool is very nice but it is not very big so it is always packed from the early morning hours, and it is ""on the road"" as many said before. But seriously who comes to Mykonos to stay at the hotel? But still it is a very nice pool with seating areas perfect for a sunset drink.Which brings me to the bar now, a very nice big aquarium/bar that has excellent drinks and music.There is an excellent japanese restaurant Kiku, that i will review separately.About the rooms, firstly avoid villas at all costs. My first night i was in a villa and couldn't sleep up until 6 in the morning because of music coming from the villa below. Then i was waken up at 8 in the morning because of the drunken neighbours above me. Many people i know have all said that the issue with cavo's villas is the noisy neighbours. But of course the people at reception were very kind and helpful and moved me to a premium deluxe room ( which was what i had booked initially ) the next day. Rooms are perfect, with sea views, terraces, and much quieter. The beds are very comfortable. Storage space is a bit lacking if you are going to spend a week there as i did. But it's the same in most hotels in Mykonos. The big problem with the rooms has nothing to do with the actual but with cleaning/housekeeping. Shower caps and vanity sets ( cotton and cotton sticks ) were never supplied. I had to ask for these every single day. Same issue with the bathrobes, they never replaced them and we had to ask for them every single evening. Also the floor was not well cleaned/dusted and i had to ask from them 3 times to come back.Hadn't it been for these issues i would have awarded Cavo Tagoo the full 5 marks. But in a 5 stars hotel these details should never be neglected.Aslo room service is less than average. But minor detail here.Now i have tried quite a few hotels in Mykonos and this one is by far the best. I will definitely be returning here and only here from now on, but at least now i know what to expect and what to ask from them specifically. And once again i want to stress on the fact that service here is the best and everyone working here is genuinely kind and helpful and super friendly. They really make you feel at home. Nothing is too much to ask. Concierge is top notch too.   Room Tip: Avoid villas, too noisy. Ask for renovated room with sea view. See more room tips",0
"We had an amazing stay at Cavo Tagoo during our honeymoon in September 2015 from the US. The staff was very nice and accommodating giving us tips and recommendations and helping us to make dinner reservations. It is nicely located near Mykonos Town and the hotel has a shuttle available 24 hours a day. Getting to the beaches requires a car or other transportation but someone is there every day to help you for your convenience.We ate at the included continental breakfast everyone morning and the food and service were excellent. We also had lunch there one day by the pool and it was also great. Our room was beautiful with a large bed, Jacuzzi tub, separate shower, and our own personal plunge pool. The main pool is also very nice with great sunbeds. We loved every second we stayed there!",0
"Definitely great choice with immaculate rooms, great food & exceptional service! Concierge service was really helpful in organizing beach reservations, dinner suggestions & arranging a driver.Remember, all the beach clubs are on the opposite side of the island and there are only like 30 cabs on the island-so private driver was a must! But the hotel is supper close to town-and there is a free shuttle bus.Great place for a romantic getaway",1
I stayed at the Cavo tagoo for 3 nights in the summer. I had the best experience ever.Beautiful rooms with great staff and an amazing location. Everything about the hotel and vibe is perfect.Would highly recommend this hotel for young travellersCheersRachit,1
"Loved the hotel, the room is modern with a beautiful sea views, breakfast is excellent.. At night drink at pool before going out for dinner is very nice .. the hotel is at walking distance from Mykonos town, but they also have a very efficient 24/7 transfer service. Over all service is very good, especially for the attention and experience of the Manager Niko... Definitely the best place to stay in Mykonos",2
"every year we have to go to their for a happy hour and watch the sunset. It is a ritual and always a great moment. We stay at the pool bar and the staff have always a warm welcoming. Drinks are fabulous, view is great. A Must in Mykonos",0
"My husband and I arrived at the Cavo Tagoo early Tuesday morning. While our room wasn't ready yet, we walked 10 minutes to Mykono's town for lunch. When we got back in the afternoon, our room was ready and we got upgraded to a suite with an infinite pool! What a wonderful surprise! The room was AMAZING and probably one of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. The thing you have to know about Cavo Tagoo is that people who come here for vacation are beautiful. The vibe at the hotel feels like a luxury hotel in Miami except with much better views. The amazing hotel infinite pool is awesome but you have to wake up early to snag a pair of chairs. Since we had an in-suite pool, we stayed in our pool for most of the trip. We had the sushi dinner at the hotel one night and it was great. I've had sushi in Tokyo at the fish market and also in New York at Sushi Nakazawa and Cavo Tagoo's sushi holds it's own. A DJ plays hip chill music and the whole vibe turns into a nice lounge. Watching the sunset at the hotel restaurant sipping cocktails and eating phenomenal sushi was the best experience of our honeymoon. The included breakfast was amazing as everyone points out. The variety is wide and the service is spot on. It is best to sit at breakfast for awhile and people watch. I had lunch at the hotel too and it was great. We went to Mykonos town and Delos but always were super excited to come back to Cavo Tagoo. A really great hotel to hang out at and be the central point. I will say that I don't think Cavo Tagoo is great for families. Most of the people there are rich, beautiful, and there to party. It felt a little over the top but that is what you want on your honeymoon!",2
"This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Situated in a fantastic location overlooking the port with a 5min walk to the town. Our ferry to Mykonos from Santorini was cancelled due to high winds so we arrived a day late. The staff at the hotel upgraded us for free and didnt charge us for the missed night. I thought this was beyond amazing. This would never happen in London. They were so welcoming and to arrive to such generous hospitality made me want to cry. The room/suite we had was beautiful. Large, comfortable with beautiful decor. Super comfortable bed as well. Great air con and overall setup. Breakfast was epic. I made the effort not to sleep in each morning just so I didnt miss out. I honestly can't rate this hotel enough. Thank you Portobello for a wonderful 3 days in Mykonos. We will be back next year.   Room Tip: Choose a suite! See more room tips",0
"Perfect place to stay for young couples. The views are breathtaking and are accompanied by amazing hispitality. Its a familly business, the rooms are gorgeous, the fiod is all homemade, fresh and tastes amazing. We r so happy with this stay, that isstrongly recommended to everyone",0
"Very nice hotel located right on the outside skirts of Mykonos town. Beautiful view of Mykonos town on top of the hill. Extremely friendly staff and very accommodating. Only downside is size of rooms which are small, but I believe all rooms are like this on the island.",0
"It's hard to find the words to make justice to this wonderful hotel. First impression was great, once I made my reservation I got an e-mail from the hotel manager thanking us for choosing them and answering a question I had. We arrived to Mykonos and took a taxi to the hotel, it only took around 10 minutes to get there. It's a nice boutique hotel very close to the town with its great stores and restaurants and where all the action takes place. It's also very well located near the public bus station where you can grab a bus to any of the island beaches. The hotel was very nice, super clean, great fragrance in the air at all times, and has a wonderful view, beds were very comfy and very tastefully decorated. They even show a message in the TV screen with the name of the guest welcoming you; I considered it such a nice gesture. Anna, the hotel manager, as well as the rest of the staff was very professional and helpful in answering our questions. The breakfast in the morning was plentiful and had a very good selection. I always had such a relaxing feeling while I was there. I strongly recommend this hotel, top customer service, best location and great views.",0
"A perfect stay. We spent 15 days in this beautiful hotel. The room was spaciuos enough and the staff especially selected the biggest one given our long stay. Super clean, very good breakfast, perfect staff. See u again next year!",0
"As soon as we we got there we were created with a smile. Staff were amazingly friendly. Rooms were beautiful, especially the breakfast was amazing. Will definitely go back and stay there again. 2 min walk from the Main Street of Mykonos. Thank you for having us.",0
"This little hotel is full of surprises. Perfect location ( few minutes from town yet calm and beautiful view) great service ( calling us twice to make sure somebody waited for our arrival to help with our bags) the rooms are charming and well done, the service is friendly and efficient .",0
"This whitewashed hotel is centrally located within Mykonos Town overlooking the Agean Sea. It is approx. a two-minute walk from Old Town where there are shops and restaurants that are open until very late evening. There is a patio with breathtaking views where you can sit and enjoy a glass of wine or have your breakfast, which is included, free of charge. The breakfast includes fresh fruits, baklavas, Spanakopita, (Greek spinach pie) and other baked items. The lobby is clean and the reception desk is friendly. The staff is not quick to recommend any company for excursions, but they do have a notebook that lists some excursions available. We prebooked an excursion online thru Viator, which was disastrous and just short of dangerous. We might have fared better by asking the reception desk about it first because they were willing to at least politely point us in a different direction.The room was absolutely beautiful but on the smaller side. It had a balcony with a view of the pool and another view of the sea! The room offered every amenity you could possibly think of. (See pictures) It was impeccably clean, had an en suite safe, air conditioner and was very comfortable. I was on the first floor, so I don't know if they have an elevator. The nightly rate was reasonable considering its location and quality. The hotel offered a bar that also had sea views. However, no one was ever in there. It was actually cooler on the patio and the views were better outside. I tried to look at their website once I returned home but could not access it. But I can highly recommend this hotel if you ever visit Mykonos!   Room Tip: Sea views available upon request See more room tips",0
"When I read the reviews, I was worried we were a bit too far from main Mykonos Town. We were not, only 2 city streets from the main town, bay, shopping and restaurants. The town is very pretty with a maze of small walking paths and alleys for you to explore.The view of the bay/harbor from our hotel room breathtaking, my partner and I will remember that view forever. The small restaurant area with indoor and outdoor tables also offered pretty views despite the island's strong winds. The breakfast is carefully and tastefully presented and should meet everyone's expectations.The hotel is a short walk down 2 sets of outdoor stairs which may be a bit strenuous on the way back after shopping and sightseeing for some but we had no problem. Just remember where to turn left or right to get back to this set of stairs on the way home. I would definitely recommend this boutique hotel, we had a great time!",0
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! We can feel their sincerity in all aspects - from check-in, reception, housekeeping to F&B. The property looks very new but their last renovation was actually 9 years ago. It's a very well-maintained property. The photos on TripAdvisor don't do justice to the hotel. Room no. 17 offers an amazing seaview. We emailed them about our vegan diet weeks before our trip. They assured that they would take care of that and they did! They got us soy milk, vegan oats and muesli for brekkie. The lady with specs who prepared the breakfast spread gave us a generous portion of fruits. We were in Santorini before Mykonos. We didn't have a pleasant experience at the hotel we stayed in Oia, hence we really appreciated that Portobello honoured their words and delivered their promise. We made an impromptu decision to rent a car. The hotel helped us coordinate with the car rental company they usually work with, the whole process was fuss-free. The lady representing Maxima car rental was forthright which we really appreciated. 2 thumbs up! Many thanks to Ana and her wonderful team at Portobello for making our stay a fabulous one!",0
Great place to stay on Mykonos. It's a bit up the hill from the central town but that makes it a quiet place to stay but still a 5 minute walk to the action. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.   Room Tip: The big patio has a great ocean and sunset view if you get a room without an ocean view. See more room tips,0
"My first visit to the Portobello, I could not be happier. The rooms are super clean and comfortable, the view is extraordinary, the location is great - a few minutes walk down the steps until you are in the thick of Mykonos' charming winding alleyways. Above all, the staff here are so friendly and helpful. I had a very unfortunate traveling experience on my way here, and my bags were lost. Everyone here went out of their way to make my trip better and retrieve my lost bags. I cannot say enough good things about each of them.I will definitely return to the Portobello, and highly recommend it!",0
5 nights in this small but so chic and so charming hotel. The staff is really perfect. The room is quite small but that is just enough. Ideally located with a wonderful view. Really nice experience in Mykonos. I recommand the hotel.,0
"Flight arrived 9.30pm, took a taxi from airport and a person was waiting at top of stairs to help with our bags - quite a few steps down to reception, very friendly and helpful staff. Lovely room with great view. Breakfast room inside opens onto a beautiful balcony which is lovely to have breakfast on but was too windy on a couple of days (Mykonos seems to often have strong winds) they have an enclosed ""sunset bar"" which works well and still offers same fantastic views. 7-10 minute walk into centre of town - fairly steep steps but not a problem - nice to be close to restaurants and shops without having noise issues at night - very quiet for sleeping.",0
"I have never given 5 stars to anything because it could always be better, but in this case I don't see how. The staff were just perfect always ready to accommodate with a smile. The location is perfect with incredible views of the city and easy access as long as you don't mind stairs which I don't. The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast each morning was great with the wonderful terrace to enjoy the breathtaking views of Mykonos. We visited with our three children to show them the beauty of Greece and our expectations were exceeded. This will be our go-to place to stay in Mykonos from now on.",0
"We stayed three nights in this small but charming and chic hotel situated just above the old town of Mykonos, giving wonderful views over the town and harbours but with only a couple of minutes walk down steps to the shops and restaurants of the town. We had opted for a standard room. It was quite small but beautifully decorated and well equipped and with a balcony to sit out. AC and wifi worked well. We didn't have a sea view but it was no hardship to go the few steps to the terrace or bar from where you could watch the bustling harbour and sunset. It was a great base from which to get reacquainted with the island after 40 years! All the staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful. Our particular thanks to Anastasia, who looked after us at breakfast (which was varied and excellent) and even took it to the enclosed sunset bar for us one day to enable us to sit and enjoy the view when it was windy. We enjoyed talking to her and wish her well in her further studies - perhaps she will visit us in the UK.Thanks again to all at the hotel.",0
"Charming hotel located at the top of the chora, staff was very pleasant and helpful throughout our stay there. h breakfast was the best part, everything is handmade each day, from the pastries to the yogurt and jams. Room was good, only complaint was that it was right off recc eption area so was a bit noisy. Otherwise was a great choice for staying in Mykonos.   Room Tip: city/ocean views are quite nice, maybe request to be off the first floor though See more room tips",0
"Portobello has the best location in Mykonos, perched on top of the old town with gorgeous views from the terrace. I had the single room with a balcony overlooking an old windmill - very nice and clean. The best part of the stay was the breakfast on the terrace. The spread was wonderful, and the spanakopita served one day was the best I had in my entire two week trip in Greece! The staff was friendly, especially the young girl who served breakfast. I will be back.",1
"Very expensive hotel with very small rooms with shower out of order, The piscine is not for the room customers, but only for the ""villa"", the parking is so small we could never find a place. The manager is very unpleasant, no amabity, very bad administration, and bad communication, when we try to speak with her, she was so impolite , we left the hotel. There is other hotels with same situation, close to the town and much more beautiful, with piscine and much cheapest... with very kind managers   Room Tip: Go to an other hotel. See more room tips",4
"This charming boutique hotel was a wonderful choice. Suggest spending more for the rooms with a balcony-wow what a view. Can't say enough about the staff-so pleasant, helpful and professional. Really a lovely spot for a hotel. Wifi good and includes a lovely breakfast on the terrace. It is a bit of a climb to the hotel, but found it worth it. Walking distance to sites, restaurants, and shops.   Room Tip: Rooms with balcony worth the price! See more room tips",0

"Spent only one night in this lovely small hotel, very friendly staff. Lovely breakfast on terrace. Room was small but very comfortable with nice toiletries and bathrobes and slippers provided.Hotel arranged taxi to collect us at port which I would recommend. We found it very quiet and yet convenient for the town centre . We stayed in May and our rate was excellent value   Room Tip: Some rooms have sea view See more room tips",0
"Concierge service was very personal by taking note of every guest's arrival, where they emailed us to get our ferry details 2 days before we arrive.We decided to take the seabus to get to Mykonos town and tug our luggage to the hotel. To our surprise, it was 1 of the toughest walk to any of the hotels in the cities we arrived in. The steps weren't even and especially the route was unclear when just arrived. The husband decided to recce the route when we are at a cross junction outside hotel, while I wait with our luggages. To my surprise, my husband returned with a hotel assistant to help us with 1 of our luggage. We forgot her name, but the concierge, a brunette with shoulder length hair told my husband that she has been waiting for us. And knowing the route to hotel with luggage is not easy, she arranged for an assistant to help us the moment my husband arrived to ask for the shortest walk route from the junction where I waited. After checking-in she briefed us about getting around the town, recommended restaurants and easily route to return to the port for our last day. Room smells fresh and is clean, view is panoramic and everyone is really warm. The breakfast was good with a really amicable waitress who helps with tea and explanation on each of their daily specials. She even waited to greet us goodbye during check-out.There's nothing we could fuss about, we'll definitely pick Portobello should we return to Mykonos again.",0
"We enjoyed the calmness, the very clean and comfortable room and beds. The staff was great as always and the breakfast was amazing. The location of the hotel is superb: wonderful view of the town and the sea - beautiful red sunset and only a few steps from all the shops and restaurants and the port. Would love to come again!!   Room Tip: Try to get a room with view, It is worth the money! See more room tips",1
"We stayed at PortoBello for two nights while we stayed in Mykonos. We arrived via the new port and took the 20 euro car service to the hotel (after reading other reviews regarding the difficulty of finding a taxi). However our trip was just before peak season (beginning of May). It is a short ride to the hotel so the 20 euros feels like a bit much. In the low season I would go with a regular taxi, but during peak season it would probably be wiser to take the car service. Walking up the hill is definitely not an option.The rooms were very clean and showers were hot and powerful. Location cannot be beat as we were just steps away from shops and restaurants (and we still had no issues with noise). As other reviewers mention, the breakfast here is amazing. Served 8AM-11AM our favorites from breakfast were the homemade greek yogurt, croissants, the feta cheese, and fresh orange juice.Staff was always available, very attentive, and happy to offer tips and suggestions for how to spend the day. Great value. The ONLY thing that could be improved is the WiFi connection which was weak or came in and out.   Room Tip: It is not necessary to book a room with an ocean view. The terrace offers just as nice a view which... See more room tips",0
"We went to Mykonos to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party and stayed at the private pool villa for the occasion at Portobello. We looooved it! We had a pool and a nice view. The rooms are nicely decorated and very clean, beds are comfortable. The hotel is really close to the center and 10 minutes to the airport. I cannot find anything to complaint about! I will definitely stay at Portobello next time in Mykonos.",0
"Booked on a non-refundable basis, still it was a lot of money for me. Great view from the front yard of the hotel, good breakfast, walking distance to the town centre with shops, restaurants and many attractions! The manager wasn't the friendliest person in the world but other members of staff were really great. My room window faced a tall white wall, it was tiny, on top of the laudry and next to the reception desk. It was noisy! Make sure you book a room on the fist floor or with a view of the town and port.   Room Tip: rooms at the front, facing the port, are the best. Second floor quieter See more room tips",0
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon last October and it was outstanding. The hotel service and breakfast were outstanding. The hotel is perched at the top of the hill overlooking Mykonos town and each room had a balcony with an outstanding view.,0
I was so lucky to find this gem. After months of researching various accomodation options I stumbled across this hotel. Perched on the hill above Mykonos Town Portobello provides amazing view to Mykonos Town and Old Port. Hotel serves delicious homemade breakfast which you can enjoy on the hotel terrace and admire the view.Location is perfect and steps away from hustle and bustle of busy Mykonos Town.Staff is very polite and helpful. Room I had was a double as I have been upgraded on arrival with no extra cost. Bed was super comfortable and bathroom had great shower. Hotel area was very clean and well maintained. The only minor thing that annoyed me was wifi which was in and out but as later turned out many hotels on the islands had similar issues. Overall I am very pleased with my 6 night stay and if I ever return to Mykonos this will be my choice.,1
"Beautiful Hotel, Portobello Hotel is a beautiful picturesque hotel that overlooks Mykonos Town and directly into an amazing sunset vista. The breakfast was fantastic easily the best we had in Greece. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Rooms were above average, with good wifi connectivity. Location was as good as I could hope for. There are a few fairly gradual steps up to the hotel from the town, the main road behind the hotel can be walked down giving quick access to a local laundry (10€) and quad bike rental places (25€) - easiest way to get to the beaches. If I have to be critical the lack of pool may disappoint some. Overall I would be happy to highly recommend this hotel.",1
"The hotel is situated at a very good location and have a great view over the Mykonos Town and the port. The room was very clean and nice and it was so relaxing for an evening nap after a long tiring walk around the town under the hot sun. The service provided by the hotel was fantastic. When we checked in to the hotel, the reception also recommended a few restaurants to us to enjoy our lunch and dinner. I love the breakfast provided by the hotel, especially its home-made yoghurt and home-made orange marmalade jam. Highly recommended to stay in this hotel.",0
"We came here during the offseason to Mykonos. The service was amazing. First off, this is the best complimentary breakfast I've ever had. They had home made yogurt and orange marmalade which we had 2-4 servings everyday. Pretty responsive on email in terms of preparing for our trip. The bathrooms and premises are very new and modern. Duravit sinks, nice finishes. There was a slight sulfur smell in the bathroom. Not sure if this is for all the rooms. In the end we were at the beach and city so didn't stay much in the hotel. The hotel is a very close walk to the city which is what we wanted. And in fact, it was even better because the sitting area is on a slight hill which overlooks all of Mykonos. It's very beautiful. Would definitely stay there again.",1
"I stayed in Portobello for 3 days. Unbeatable view all day long which you will never get bored. I feel so welcome by the staff there, very good restaurant recommendation got from them, as well as some great tour spots, and they are always helpful with lovely smile. The location is perfect, there are steps to walk up to hotel but it is quite gentle indeed, take it slow and you will find lots of beautiful things on the way. Though it is not a big hotel but everything is perfect there.   Room Tip: the suite we stayed is perfect. pick the one with balcony facing the ocean, you won't regret to... See more room tips",0
"HiI stayed in this charming boutique hotel with a group of friends for 4 days.The hotel is located minutes from downtown, very close to lots of shops and restaurants.Wonderful terrace in the front of the hotel, overlooking an amazing view of the sea, the harbor and lovely white and blue homes of Mykonos.Lovely rooms, very clean and with a design that makes a relaxed atmosphere. Sleeping experience is great!The staff has a very high standard of service; they give you a feeling that you are a special guest, even a part of their family. Helleni's special breakfast that is served every morning makes you feel you are having breakfast at a local home. The spinach pie is highly recommended!There are variety of rooms, some suites are in a separate complex and includes a private swimming pool.Highly recommended boutique hotel, no doubt we'll be happy to go back there again!",0
"Great location to the main street within walking distance but do take note that there are at least 3 storeys of stairs to climb when you are going back to the hotel. And the area near the hotel is very dark when the sun has set. Other than that, the hotel is very clean and the staffs are very friendly. We stayed in the connected rooms, the wifi was quite weak in the rooms but great in the living room. The balcony was great and we can see the sunset in one of room and balcony. In conclusion, it was a comfortable hotel in great location with nice breakfast served. Highly recommended without the consideration of climbing so many stairs.",0
"This hotel is a sweet little gem located in Mykonos town close to all the shops and restaurants. Its a close walk down to the town center, and I say ""down"" as the hotel is located at the top of the hill which offers wonderful views of the town below and the Aegean Sea. But for those who have limited mobility the stairs up, or down, to the hotel/town may be a challenge.The hotel isn't very big but offers a nice light breakfast in the morning. You can sit out with your morning breakfast with this great view of the town, windmills included, and the sea. In the evening you can also sit out at the sunset bar with a drink and watch the sun set or star gaze.Hotel is well maintained, and rooms very clean and well kept. Newer finishes but the bathroom is so small. I kept the door open to make it feel bigger but I kept banging my elbow into it and left with a bruise on my right arm. But the shower is fine, newly done, good water pressure and overall the room is full of natural light with a window and patio door. I had a double room but it didn't have an ocean view but it had a small balcony which overlooked the windmill situated right behind the hotel. Still very pretty.I really liked this little hotel. Offered everything I was looking for. Close access to get to shops/restaurants and clean and well maintained. I would stay here again and recommend it.",1
"The previous accommodation was so appalling it threatened to ruin our visit to Mykonos. We chanced upon PortoBello which was comfortable, operated at a very high level of service, well located and best of all, has outstanding staff. Bravo!",0
"We chose this hotel because of other peoples feedback on TA. It was everything we expected and more.It's interesting that you can have all the amenities in the world but it's the attitude of the staff that make the difference and the staff at this hotel are outstanding but unobtrusive. I felt so well looked after that I didn't really want to leave. That's how they all make you feel.The home made breakfasts, enjoyed leisurely overlooking the town and sea, will be remembered for a long time.   Room Tip: A room with balcony overlooking the town and sea are great See more room tips",0
My husband and I loved staying at this hotel! It is very close to the city center and has a beautiful view. They arranged a taxi from the airport which was very convenient and completely worth it. Lovely breakfast and the staff couldn't be nicer. Highly recommend staying here.,1
"Great location with an awesome view of harbour and windmills (best view means you need to walk up and down a few steps to the shops, restaurants but so worth it and you do not have to be in top fitness). We fell in love with the Greek breakfast cuisine and loved how the breakfast lady took such pride and delight in us enjoying her homemade yoghurt, marmalade, greek spinach pie etc ... it felt like a family run hotel. We were sad to leave.",0
"We chose Portobello based on amazing TA reviews and its location to the town. We were not disappointed! Clean, good facilities, comfortable bed and helpful staff! Finished off by a delicious breakfast looking over the town!",0
"This hotel inspired me to join TripAdvisor to make my first post! Great views over the town (see their facebook page) with outdoor meal seating taking full advantage of the views, really nice breakfast (I almost never have a hotel breakfast!) and friendly and informative service from all staff. The hotel allows quick access into the town though a few stairs to contend with coming home late each night though. It is mid-range pricing from our short research but we are confident we received great value. Certainly suggest asking for a room with a town/harbour view. I recommend the PortBello Hotel and am a late adopter of TripAdvisor to say so!   Room Tip: Ask for a sea view. It's a must! See more room tips",0
"The view from the terrace is beautiful especially the sunsets. It's a short walk to the old port, cafes and shops. The room is small but comfortable. The bathroom is fine but a fixed shower head would be better than the handheld one. The air conditioner worked well and kept the room at a comfortable temperature. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Great location. Just a few mins walk to the little lanes lined with shops and restaurants.",0
"We paid a lot of money to stay in this hotel , which is not a luxury one as they want to portray. Yes it overlooks Mykonos Town, yes, it includes breakfast , which is made by the winter manager but our room was uncomfortable because you had to go up and down some very steep steps that I was afraid of the whole trip . The steps separated the main entrance which had a living room from the bedroom and the bathroom. The bathroom was really small. The bed was really comfy. We did not use the pool. The personel is really nice specially during breakfast where you meet the staff. The reception is not as helpful as we would like to . The difference between a converter and a transformer is crucial for international travelers. The staff seemed not to be familiar with this. If I had used the adaptor that they provided I would have burnt my electronics. Which I did not get to use .Internet is really bad in the hotel.You also have to go down a lot of steps to be in the town but if you are in shape they will be ok. If you are not you will be out of breath. Parking is really small.Beaches are at least 20 mins to drive to.Shomon is a really nice guy that helps you with your luggage and the cleaning ladies went out of their way when they saw our towels drying outside. They took them ,washed them and dried them so that we had fresh ones.",0
"Go no further to see magnificent views from the breakfast patio, stunning sunsets which sum up each day and yet you are only a step away from the action.The staff make you feel at home and even share their chocolates.I'm looking forward to my next visit ...... And of course, there's the chocolates.   Room Tip: Fantastic views, great sunsets, drinks and breakfast on the patio,excellent staff.....great chocolat... See more room tips",0
"The situation is ideal: close from the city center but also quiet! The bed are amazing! The bathroom are classy! The people working there are nice and helpful! If you have the opportunity to come here, do not hesitate!",0
"Had a great stay, quiet and peaceful hotel, staff was polite and helpful, rooms are clean and well kept, located 2 minutes from all shops and restaurants. Front desk was able to advise me on any questions I had for them. Restaurant, car rentals, beaches etc.",0
An immaculate hotel situated high above the township of Mykonos with breathtaking views to the town centre below and the blue ocean... The staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was to die for!! The cakes and pastries were all home cooked. My only minor problem were the many steps to walk and down to get into the town center but I attribute this to my older age - the younger guests would not have any issues with the walk... The hotel is an easy taxi ride from the ferry port and a quick cab ride to the airport - nothing is far away in Mykonos...,0
"We knew that the nightlife of Mykonos is amazing. So we stayed the first night of our Mykonos trip in PortoBello Boutique Hotel before going to stay in a luxury hotel in Elia beach. We stayed in 5 stars luxury hotels in our Greece trip but this one because we believed we would spend most of our time outside rather than staying in the hotel. But we were very impressed by the quality and service of this 3 stars hotel. There are only few staffs in this small hotel. They are all very friendly. The hotel located in a very good location. It's about 10mins away from the town. Even we needed to walk up to the hotel. That's still a very pleasant walk. The view of the hotel is stunning. Outside of the reception and breakfast room, that's the view of the whole Mykonos town from above. Sunset is stunning as well. We specially love the breakfast. All the homemade pastries, yogurt and bread were delicious. This is really the best you can get from any 3 stars hotels.",0
"We've stayed at Portobello for 5 days,we loved it.It has a great view,sitting outside and having the great breakfast or just enjoying an afternoon coffee is great.The rooms are perfectly designed very clean,the stuff is very friendly and helpful. There is great variety of things to do in this great island.We warmly recommend this quiet hotel.   Room Tip: The rooms with sea view are breathtaking See more room tips",0
The staff are so friendly and very helpful especially the one who prepares breakfastThe hotel is good for families and the location is perfect as its a walling distance to the shopping district and restaurants and the view is all mykonos city and old port The new port is 10 minutes by car (taxi) and the airport is not too far and transportation cost 20€ to the hotel by taxiRooms are clean and wifi is goodMake sure you request a room with the city ( sea) view The pool is only for the private villa Parking is available and enough for 4 cars total I would def recommend to stay in this hote,0
"This is a clean, efficient place with a friendly helpful 24 hr staff, great Wi-fi, great AC and fabulous breakfast with port and city views. Clean rooms and 100% as promised amenities and services. A nice, calm, clean, well positioned oasis in Chora.",0
"We absolutely loved staying in this simple but stylish little hotel, conveniently situated within walking distance to the centre of Mykonos but situated up on the hill overlooking the town, it is beautiful and very peaceful. The staff are very friendly and the breakfasts are a treat to be looked forward to daily, fresh fruits and freshly baked tarts, cheeses and fresh pastries - we look forward to returning to this charming hotel!

the portobello boutik hotel in mikonos greece is located two minutes walk from the center of mikonos and yet in a very intimate and quiet location overlooking the bay and allowing you to enjoy on its terrace the most beutiful sunsets i ever saw. the rooms are very nice and clean and the service is personal and very friendly. i will certainly return there on my next visit to greece.,0
"Best experience in Porto bello Mykonos!!  My husband and I stayed here from the moment we arrived there was nothing to fault everthing was amazing the room was beautiful and had the most amazing view of all mykonos ! The breakfast in the morning was great the cook helen did special orders and made us the most amazing omelets with feta cheese wish we could take helen home with us ! , we will definatly be coming back to this hotel and recommend to anyone wanting to stay in mykonos to book and stay at the Porto bello , it's a 5min walk Max to all the beautiful shops Mykonos town and to little Venice ! Look no further book at Porto bello when staying in Mykonos ! Love from Conrad and Jenny from Australia !!   Room Tip: Book front rooms to get front view of Mykonos town and port , See more room tips",0
"The place was beautiful, comfortable, well situated and the staff was super helpful. Prior to arriving they arranged a car rental (at a competitive rate) and arranged for the car to be waiting for us at the airport. The accommodation was very clean and comfortable. The view from our room was fantastic as it overlooked the entire city, the old windmills, and the ocean. Additionally, the advertised wifi worked well. The breakfast was a great way to start the day and offered a big variety of quality food, pastries and fruit. Great way to start every day. Upon our departure Dimitrius knew we'd be leaving prior to breakfast being offered and he took it upon himself to set up a table for 2 with coffee, toast an yogurt prior to our departure. It was a classy gesture by a classy hotel. If ever back in Mykonos we will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.   Room Tip: Ask about the city view rooms. I imagine rooms facing the back would have a view of the parking lot... See more room tips",2
"my husband and i spent a long week end ( 3 nights) at the Portobello earlier this month. we very much enjoyed our stay there! the Hotel is very well located, easily accessible by car, and walking distance from the center and and the old port. the views form the terrace- especially the sunsets- are breathtaking. the staff was extremely kind and helpful, and the rooms spotlessly clean and decorated in good taste. breakfast, which was included in the rate, was beautifully presented, with a wide offering of fresh food, some of it quite original, and including pistachio halva, tahini, fresh fruit,danishes, cereals, home baked desserts etc.   Room Tip: the hotel has a private villa with pool that we did not stay in but had a peek at- it looked to be...

"From the view to the music everything is really pleasant...the hotel is elegant and cozy. The rooms are big and full of lovelly details, they're also brand new. The staff is unique and gave grace to our stay. The breakfast is delicious in every aspect, the best yogurt is made by the most kind greek person we met...very good wifi and air conditioning. The location is excellent, you can walk to bars and restaurants and see the sunset from your balcony.",0
"Sometimes it is the town or tourist attraction that is the most memorable part of a trip. Rarely is it the hotel. For us the PortoBello was the best part of our time in Mykonos. We had a lovely suite (#8) overlooking Mykonos Town yet just a 5 minute walk down into the port with all the shops and restaurants. The PortoBello is also a very quiet oasis away from the crowds in town. Each morning there is a very good breakfast with freshly made Greek pastries and homemade yogurt and orange marmalade. On very breezy days you can still enjoy breakfast outside by going a few steps up to the sunset bar with its panoramic view. Every one of the staff, from the front desk, to the bellman, to the kitchen staff was warm, friendly and professional. Others have noted, and it is true, the the view is one of the best and a stones thrown from two historic windmills. Before arriving, the front desk was very quick to respond to our emails and prepared a basket of fruit, cheese and wine at my request to help celebrate our 25th anniversary. This is definitely the place to stay if you want the experience of Mykonos Town and a quiet, relaxing retreat.",0
"Located a few minutes up the hill behind the main streets, Portobello makes a nice retreat from the noise and crowds, while being within convenient walking distance. Being on the hill also offers very nice views of town. The room itself was relatively small, but it was nicely appointed and better yet the bed and pillows were very comfortable (probably the best we had in Greece). From what we were told by our cabbie, this place was recently purchased and renovated (within the last few years), and it does show as everything looks fresh and nice. The staff was very nice and helpful, and the included breakfast was good and the patio on which to enjoy said breakfast is great as well (breakfast served from 8-10). You can also enjoy drinks on the patio later in the day. One word of advice - - if you're arriving by ferry, accept the offer to pre-book a car. There are only 30 taxis and it can take a while to get one (we waited 30-40 minutes to get a taxi from the port, which was about 2 miles away).",1
"Rarely do you experience such wonderful, friendly service as we had at the Portobello Boutique Hotel. The property and the level of service were excellent. The customer service is so good because the staff have the desire for their clients to be happy. This experience added a memorable highlight to our visit in Mykonos.The location is only a few minutes walk from the town. The views are stunning. We thoroughly recommend this property and would definitely stay again. Well done to all the staff at the Portobello Boutique Hotel!",0
The beautiful panoramic view and the attentive and kind stuff (especially Eleni and Nacia) made our stay on Mykanos island unforgettable. It is a perfect location to discover the town. Easy walking distance reach to all the shopping and much more.   Room Tip: request the room view a view or enjoy the beautiful patio outside open to everyone See more room tips,0
"Portobello is truly a gem in old town of Mykonos. It's only 5 mins walk to the town but you will not be hear any noise at night. Then hotel decor is very chic and modern with an amazing view of the town and sunset. The staff are super friendly and informative. They made sure our stay was enjoyable from beginning to end by arranging our transportation to and from the ferry port, providing us with beach towels in a reusable tote bag and took care of all of our requests. I would highly recommend staying here.",0
"PortoBello Hotel was absolutely the highlight of our stay in Greece. I am honestly not sure why it is not ranked in the Top 5 hotels in Mykonos Town. Perfect location and super friendly staff. Only 2 min walk to the very heart of Mykonos Town (restaurants, bars, shops), yet far enough from the late-night party noise at night. The views from the hotel are unbelievable, especially from the common balcony where breakfast is served daily (which by the way is delicious; home-made pies by one of the staff ladies). The rooms are very clean, super comfortable and modern. Highly recommended!!",0
"It was a pleasure staying at Portobello Boutique Hotel. The location is amazing right above the Chora of Mykonos and there is a taxi station nearby in case you do not have a car. The view was stunning, the bed was giant and the room was clean. Special thanks to the extremelly polite staff who helped us when our departure was delayed.   Room Tip: ask for a room with a view to Chora and not the road See more room tips",0
"its a bit walking distance from the Fabrica station, front desk are very helpful. helped us with planning i love the hotel. clean and neat. breakfast is nice with good view, you can watch the sunset from the hotel. will return   Room Tip: u may want to top up for a seaview room See more room tips",0
"Stayed at the Portobello in the 3rd week of April 2015. We were very lucky with the weather and got to experience the Island just at the start of the season - very different indeed to the busy Summer, but great all the same. You may have read about the '50 steps' up and down from the Hotel to the town - and this cannot be denied. There is of course a price to pay for any view and what a gorgeous view it is! A tip is use the pathway to the left of the Hotel as this route up and down down is less steep - although you need to be a good navigator to find the path back - to the left of the Church was our guiding landmark. The Hotel itself is comfortable and a great base for Chora town and surprisingly quiet being so close to things. The room (number 3) that we stayed in had now view and was quite small but if you are staying in your hotel room in Mykonos you are in the wrong place! Another highlight of the Hotel is Eleni's home prepared breakfasts - very tasty and traditional - her home made Greek yoghurt earned a start every day from me! Both Anna and Ioanna in reception also deserve a mention as both were very helpful and always happy to chat. Another misunderstanding is the availability of a pool - there is one but it is for use of guests of the Villa only - not general guests.To us the beautiful sunsets, the interesting and ever changing view, and the helpful team are the reasons why you would stay at the Portobello. I would genuinely recommend this hotel for those that appreciate these things. If I had to critic one thing it would be the wi-fi which is only available inside the breakfast area and was often unreliable. We would definitely consider staying at the Portobello next time and would recommend the Hotel to mature couples who have time to smell the roses.",0
"I stayed there end of April 2015, i enjoyed the view from my everyday, stunning my room (pictures) was very comfortable the only little bad point was a very very small bathroom, but then again you're not sleeping in a bathroom. Breakfast excellent most of it is home made. Staff just very welcoming brilliant. Keep up the good work. I will definitely stay there again.",0
"This amazing hotel delivers everything you could ask for in a hotel and more! My experience with the hotel started off with being contacted almost a month before my stay by the Reservations Manager. She wanted to confirm my method of arrival to the island and if I needed any assistance renting a car/bike/atv or having a taxi waiting for me upon my arrival. She even gave me some insight on the bus system in Mykonos and provided some other general info to help prepare me for my arrival.Upon arrival, the staff was extremely hospitable, the bellman refused to let me carry any of my luggage and I found myself having friendly conversations with every staff member I came across during my check-in. The receptionist was especially wonderful, she escorted me to my room and chatted with me for about 15 minutes, providing me with restaurant recommendations, informing me on the various beaches/how to get there, and where everything was in Mykonos Town (clubs, Little Venice, best bars, etc.). Upon leaving and returning to the hotel, I was always greeted warmly by whomever was working the reception and would have a small conversation with her before continuing on my way.I booked a seaview room with a balcony and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. It overlooked the entirety of Mykonos Town and was in perfect view of the gorgeous sunsets. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable and had a few small touches that made hospitality experience even more memorable. The bathroom was also immaculate!Lastly, the included breakfast buffet is one of the other big highlights of this hotel. Every morning 2 - 3 wonderful ladies prepare a scrumptious Greek breakfast spread that could fill you up for about half the day. One of the women prepares a homemade apple pie that is TO DIE FOR. If you do anything at this hotel, EAT THAT APPLE PIE!Overall, Mykonos is beautiful island and I am positive I am going to return, when I do, I will definitely be staying at Portobello again. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mykonos, you won't be disappointed.   Room Tip: Opt for the Seaview room w/ the balcony! See more room tips",1
"Portobello Hotel exceeded my expectations. The hotel was very modern and extraordinarily clear. The location was both convenient and quiet. The hotel is located up the hill from all of the restaurants and bars which made it convenient to drive to the beaches but easy to walk down to town. The morning breakfast wasn't my favorite, and the wifi didn't work well from the back building, but the hotel was an incredible value overall and the staff was incredibly helpful. I look forward to staying at Portobello Hotel again.   Room Tip: Rooms in the back building (there are two, I believe) were spacious and beautiful but wifi didn'... See more room tips",1
"I see all these stars and know they have meaning...but this place is definitely underated in the ""star"" department. A scent of lavender spritz from ""somewhere in the room"" while you are sleeping. The biggest bath towels in any hotel, like wrapping up in a blanket. The crispest, freshest sheets and all the beautiful accents-fresh flowers in the bathrooms. This is a wonderful place to stay.The walk down the stairs to the town is expected, the walk back up is not the best (difficult)-but an alternative is to go up to the main street and walk on the flat road to the edge of town (5-10 min) and wander through all the shops and restaurants until you are back to the water front.Mykonos is beautiful. This hotel has the best view, sit on the patio, have some wine, play some cards, read a book and just enjoy your holiday...",2
"My husband and I stayed 5 days at this wonderful hotel. The staff were attentive, informed and incredibly helpful in introducing us to their accomodations and island. We can't say enough about how much they helped us to experience the surroundings, find quiet and non-touristy restaurants, and enjoy our time spent there. We rented a scooter...which I highly recommend, to get around the island on your own schedule. The location and views from the Hotel are spectacular, the cleanliness and comfort of the room was at the top of the charts and the food was great. I highly recommend this hotel and staff to other guests! Lori and Johnny Hoover, California   Room Tip: Some rooms come with access to the pool I believe, or maybe it was just the villa.

"My original intention was to walk from the old ferry terminal to the hotel (probably a 15-20 min walk), but after a very rough ferry ride from Santorini, and a sick family, not to mention the heat, it was taxi time. Not easy when many people have left the ferry. I got in touch with reception trying to figure out walking or what and then seeing if they could get us a taxi. Success and my family was happy for the ten minute ride, not having to lug their luggage. The staff were very helpful, commiserating with the sickies, and efficiently ensconcing us in our room. It was clean, bright, cool and we had a room overlooking the harbor and Mykonos Town. Very nice. A refuge! A five to ten minute walk, including approx. 50 steps, and we were in Mykonos Town. So, one goes to and fro from the hustle and bustle to a sanctuary. Our day would start with a fabulous breakfast (there was a good selection and enough to feed two teens) on the patio over looking the harbor. You have to love the homemade stuff!! The staff were helpful and had good ideas, whether it was taking local transit to a beach or renting atvs. When I had lost my wallet, they were helpful in making phone calls, getting a taxi etc. Yes, I located my wallet with money and credentials intact (the taxi driver said, ""only in Greece!""). It was with sadness when it was time to depart and the staff were helpful in getting us a taxi, which always seem in short supply. As we did not stay in a villa, we were not able to access the pool, which would have been nice. Perhaps there might be a way in the future! we would definitely stay here again.",1
The Portobello was the best place I stayed at during my two weeks in Greece. The staff was wonderful and extremely helpful in getting situated in Mykonos. I liked that it was away from the main tourist area and out balcony looked over the town and the sea.,1
We had a most wonderful experience in this lovely hotel. The view from its location is breathtaking. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is very kind and helpful. We enjoyed a wonderful reach breakfast on the balcony in front of the hotel. We will definitely come again.,1
"It takes 50 steps up from Mykonos Town to reach the Portobello Hotel lobby. But these steps make all the difference between being in the crowded and narrow streets of Mykonos Town and being in a tranquil setting above the fray. Portobello is located just below the reconstructed windmill which houses the Mykonos folk museum ( not the five famous windmills on the waterfront). The panoramic views from the rooms and from the breakfast areas are terrific: especially at sunset. We opted for a garden room in the separate 'villa' section of the hotel. This allowed us access to the swimming pool and to a shared garden space with trees, tables, and lounge chairs. There is no view from the villa. Frankly, the pool was colder than the sea during our time there so we did not utilize it at all. The direct access to the garden was a nice touch and allowed us to catch a breeze through the venetian style window shutters. The room and bathroom were modern and comfortable. The tile in the shower/bath need some repair work. But this is a flaw which is easily overlooked.The staff is simply great. They will give you personal advice on which beach to go to, what bus to take, and its characteristics ( natural, party, gay, or organized with chairs and umbrellas). Ava,in particular, encouraged us one time to ""Don't lose this day. The weather is perfect for the beach) and she was absolutely right. Dinner reservations, taxis to the port, tickets to Delos, were all handled with complete success.I strongly recommend that you have the hotel book you a taxi when you arrive either at the airport or by ferry. There are only 30 taxis on the island and you may need to wait if you don't have a reservation.Breakfast is rich and indulgent. It include home made yogurt, crispy croissants, eggs, cold cuts, spinach or cheese pie, etc. If you want to be totally outrageous, you can even get your home made apple tart served with Mastika flavored ice cream. Looking for the sunset view? Just walk down to the lobby, order a drink, and watch the sun set over Mykonos from the deck. It is can be magical.",2
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Portobello boutique hotel. The hotel is set on a hill overlooking Mykonos town. In our view this was the best of both worlds - a five minute walk to the old port through cute narrow lanes but in a quiet spot with fantastic sunset views from the terrace. The hotel was stylishly done, with some nice design touches. Our room wasn't the largest but that didn't matter. The staff were friendly and had some great recommendations for eating and drinking in Mykonos Town. I would definitely recommend. As my partner put it, 'a beautiful oasis amidst the hubbub of Mykonos town'.",1
"Great boutique hotel in miconos, friendly staff, confortable rooms, beautiful view!!! The best view and sunset!!!! Only a few steps from the beautiful streets of the center!! I would stay there again!!! I really recomend this amazing hotel...",0
"We stayed this hotel for 3 nights and we wished to stay much longer in this hotel. The room we stayed at was Deluxe Sea view room, and this was amazing. You can see all the Mykonos town from your balcony and you can just chill out whole the time just reading books and watching beautiful sunset. The room was just a right size, or maybe bigger that what you normally expect for Mykonos Town. Bed room and bathroom was quite normal, but living room was quite large and useful.The reception person was very helpful for everything we asked for. They gave us many recommendation for the place to visit, took care of renting bikes, even prepared you for transportation from and to the hotel if we need to it. The breakfast was simple yet was great taste. It seems like some of the food was home made by the owner lady. You should definitely try Greek Yogurt and fruit jam. They can also make good coffee with the style you liked. you can eat out looking down the Mykonos city.You can walk to the town center, but there is few steps that you need to climb up when you come back. Even it has some steps, this is not big of the deal since it is quite small steps.We definitely stay there if we goes to Mykonos again.   Room Tip: Better to have Ocean view deluxe room See more room tips",1
"It is a great hotel, just a few steps from the city center, with absolutely amazing view. Of the shore and old Port. it also has great homemade breakfast. Rooms have everything you need.I loved it, my wife too...We recommend without restrictions.",0
"Came to Mykonos in the height of the tourist season ( European Summer) and received personalised service. Felt I was not just another tourist passing through town. We were well received and treated extremely well throughout our stay. I recommend this hotel very highly as the staff make it great! ..also very neat! Easy access to local bus service, no need to use expensive taxis! Free superb Wifi!!!   Room Tip: Stayed on third floor which was very quiet. See more room tips",0
"Overall our stay at the Hotel was wonderful. The staff were happy and attentive. The location is ideal and within walking distance to the beach. Great facilities including pool, bar and restaurant. An impressive room that was clean, quiet and comfortable",0
"Nice hotel 5 mins walk to Platys Gialos beach where you can also get a boat to Super Paradise, Paraga, Paradise, Elia beach etc. Bus stop for Mykonos town is also 5 mins away. Decent breakfast and pool although we didn't spend much time there. Good restaurant recommendations (especially Nikos Gallop - amazing!!). Organised a transfer through the hotel to/from Mykonos port. €30 each way but worth it to have someone meet you at the port. Cabs are really hard to find in Mykonos.",0
"I'll miss this place always until next time. I would recommend this hotel to all who want the right location, staff, scenery, relaxation and feel of Mykonos Island. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights on our honeymoon. We were so happy with everything at the hotel.",0
"Was very impressed with the room and how friendly all the staff were! When we first arrived we were given tips on places to visit and no question was too hard for the staff to answer! Location was great, only a short walk to the beach and restaurants. Will defiantly we recommending Pelican Bay Art Hotel to friends.",0
"Totally loved it here, staff were great, and location was awesome. close to local bus, restaurants, and the beach. Very clean and room was super comfortable. Would recommend this place for anyone, singles, couples and families",0
"We stayed two nights, very comfy hotel with great service and very friendly staff especially Petros the bartender , the view from our balcony was breathtaking , the breakfast was fine , we had a plate of gyros in the evening very tasty, hotel is very near a beach so very convenient",0
"Really enjoyed spending time here. Beautiful hotel. Good location, handy for local bus and tour pick up points. Very clean. Beautiful pool. Good selection for breakfast, would have like cooked items to be warmer.",0
"We stayed here for 7 days and would highly recommend this hotel! Room was great , 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 2 balcony. Pool was good size, plenty beds. Staff were fantastic, breakfast very nice and Zannis made the best coffee and was more than a delight to have look after you! Would definitely stay there again , great location with good veiws and very well priced!",0
Bad experience. Very smelly room and bathroom. Breakfast with very little varieties and repeated every day. Small pool. Highly overrated hotel.The only good thing was the hostility of the receptionist Mariana.Not recommended at all.,0
Great hotel and excellent location near the beach and the bus stop. Rooms are so nice and very comfortable and the view is lovely.The food at restaurant is delicious and the breakfast is really good. Also thepeople are extremely kind.We traveled by an agency but next time I go to Mykonos surely come back to this hotel.,0
"This was one of the most perfect hotels I have ever stayed at. It had a quaint cottage decor and a welcoming ambience to it. The rooms were large and comfortable and the pool was amazing. The water was warm and crystal clear. There was a nice view from around the pool and a pool bar to purchase beverages isif desired. The breakfast was excellent and you could eat indoors or on their terrace. There was a bus just a short distance from the hotel that took you to downtown Mykonos for 1.8 euros. You were also a 5 minute walk to a beautiful beach. If you don't order food or a beverage, there is a charge for the loungers with umbrellas on the beach (not associated with hotel...but at the nearby beach). There was a fridge in the room, and a generously sized bathroom. There were also complimentary liqueurs in the lobby. The decor was tastefully done and had a relaxing vibe to it. We also had a balcony off our room with a partial view of the bay area. Our beds were a bit stiff; typical in Europe. There is a small store on the walk to the beach to buy necessities. Water in Greece is mandated to cost only 0.50 Euros, and so we picked that up from there. They do not recommend drinking water on the Islands. We loved Mykonos (despite it being very windy downtown). We felt it was a beautiful, safe, and enjoyable place to visit. The roads are narrow and pedestrians should be careful with the busy scooters and vehicles. We loved the Pelican Bay hotel and it was a relaxing sanctuary that we would recommend highly from the hustle and bustle of shopping, barhopping, and touring downtown Mykonos!!! *We were on a Trafalgar tour and everyone in our group liked this hotel!",0
Location and rooms were terrible for price paid Staff were friendly although no assistance with getting into town. Would have been helpful having a shuttle like what other hotels offered. Rooms are run down and need some upgrades,0
"I decided to go to Mykonos at the last minute for the weekend and there was very few options available, that were reasonably priced. I didn't have high expectations from Pelican Bay Art Hotel, as I was really looking for just somewhere to sleep, but actually I was really overwhelmed with how great this hotel is.The staff are super professional and friendly, the hotel is immaculate and centrally located in Platis Gialos. My room, 122, was stunning and had two balconies looking out over the bay.I'd highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again, next time I visit Mykonos.",0
Great boutique hotel in a fantastic location that is away from the crowds but close enough to facilities and all the amenities you need. The experience was topped off with excellent service from all the onsite staff. Great brothers working at the pool bar - very charming and personable to everyone that is staying there. Looking forward to my next stay.,0
"This was our second year back at Pelican Bay, and we loved it even more than last time. Antonis, Mariana, Petros, Zannis, ALL of the staff are so lovely and we'd call them our friends.We cannot wait to come back again soon, and we miss you all already.",0
Not only was the hotle beautifully decorated but the stuff where friendly as well. Very clean. Breakfast was perfectly timed til 11am and the variety was appreciated. I will definitely be returning to stay. Thank you,0
"We love it ! Clean hotel well located 5 min walk to the beach and you must eat at Nikos Gallop restaurant near the hotel ! Very good food and good price! The pool is also good to realxe, personal are nice and can give you tip for your stay",0
"First time I traveled to Mykonos. Hotel has a great atmosphere, beautiful interior decoration and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I stayed in the VIP room overlooking the pool area with a great skyline view. Pool area was very clean and well kept. Breakfast was just right, not to heavy, nor light, just enough to get you started for the day. the beach is a 5 minute walk, the bus to town is every 30 min. and great local restaurants are walking distance from the hotel. I had the pleasure of meeting two great staff members: brothers Zannis and Petros whom both made the experience a memorable one. I also had the pleasure of meeting the hotel manager Antonis whom is very kind and friendly. The hotel staff made me feel like I was at home. I am definitely coming back to stay at Pelican Bay and recommending it to all of my friends and family.",0
"We stayed at Pelican Bay Art Hotel for 2 brief nights and wished we could have stayed longer. We were greeted at the front desk by the manager and receptionist. They quickly processed our check in and gave us our keys. There are decanter of liquor in the lobby to enjoy and savour as you like. A nice idea after a crazy drive through Mykonos. The hotel is a nice boutique hotel. With a small feeling where everyone knows you! Our room was beautiful and you could see the sea from both of our balconies. We had a large room with a king size bed. The bed was painfully hard and uncomfortable for both of us. The room was well appointed and had a nice sitting area and nice furniture. The bathroom was small and had a bath/shower combination. There were nice soaps and shampoos. There was a small fridge to store your water and snacks if you wanted. There were 2 small water bottles in the fridge. A coffee kettle and coffee essentials. Our hotel was in the Platys Gialos area. We were 6 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to the bus stop. An excellent location for us. Breakfast was served daily from 8:00-11:00 am. It was a good breakfast with a wide variety of both hot and cold foods. Eggs of every style, hot dogs the Hellenic people call sausages , French fried potatoes, bacon, and sweet breads, cereals, meats and cheeses. Even the most picky eater could find many things they would want to eat. No one would leave this breakfast hungry. The staff who worked at the breakfast did an excellent job. The pool area was nice also. A small pool area with a bar and several loungers and umbrellas. There is a beautiful view of the sea and the yachts anchored off Platys Gialos. The pool was about 78-80 degrees. Cool but nice for the heat of the day. The sun was strong so the pool was inviting and very clean. There is a gym but we did not use it. We really did not have enough time at this hotel sadly. Notes on MykonosThe roads are dangerous and people drive like maniacs. There are mirrors on corners so you could see what was about to hit you! We were told that at least 100 people / tourist are killed a year due to road accidents. We saw several people when leaving Mykonos who were bandaged due to road rash injuries. Again on this island people insisted on renting mopeds and quads or small cars. No one follows the rule of driving ( North American rules at least like stopping at stop signs or merging into traffic). Mykonos is known as the party island. We were not there to party so I cannot report on that part but saw many people getting ready for an all night event. The city bus runs every 30 minutes and cost 1.80 euro each and runs on a good schedule. We took the bus easily from Platys Gialos to Mykonos town centre easily. We went to see the windmills and took a tour out of the old port to Delos. The bus was the best way to get from hotel to town without any problems at all. You can buy tickets in advance or pay on the bus. The town of Mykonos itself was confusing and maze like. We were well prepared for this! All roads lead to the port at some point. So prepare yourself before hand that you will wander until you find your destination so leave enough time! We would definitely return again but more prepared for the painfully hard beds.",0
Everything was wonderful at the hotel. Great location and friendly staff. Hotel and pool are very clean. Breakfast was average. Only complaint was hard bed and pillows. We will definitely return in the future and enjoyed our time here.,0
The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The location was quiet which was what we wanted. Few minutes walk to the beach. Breakfast had lots of choice. Staff very friendly and professional. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for such a wonderful experience in Mykonos.,0
"Great staff, incredible bar man, great food at a great price. Service man fixed my suitcase refusing to take compensation. Good location for bus stop and beach. 100% would come back! Such a great place, highly HIGHLY recommend.",0
"We spent marvellous days in your beautiful hotel. All was nice. Nothing was unexpected. We liked very much the room, the view, the pool, the dining room, and the people who attended us. All of them were very kind with us. The place was marvellous, very close from the beach and from the bus stop. We were really very lucky to choose your hotel.",0
This place was 100% perfect. Right from the management to the rooms. Perfect! It was the best hotel my husband and I have ever stayed at. The location was perfect. Within walking distance to the beach and great restaurants! ThNks to everyone who made out stay so wonderful!,0
"Except for the pillows too hard to sleep, everything else was fantastic. The staff was incredible and the breakfast and meals were great. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the hotel is not too far from the beachs and the bus to go the City of Mykonos.",0
"We stayed at Pelican Bay Art Hotel for 3 nights, in one of the VIP Rooms. The view from the balcony was incredible. The pool, common areas, and complimentary breakfast were all wonderful. I would highly recommend to other folks visiting Mykonos!",0
"This beautiful hotel is in a perfect location only 5 minutes walk from the beach and restaurants. Spotlessly clean and great views from our room. The Manager Antonis would have to be the most welcoming and friendliest manager I have ever had thoughout my travels of Europe. His help with my booking online made things so easy. The pool staff especially Yanis and his brother were so obliging and nothing was ever any bother. Highly recommend you try Pelican Art you surely won't be disappointed. Looking forward to returning. Thanking all staff, you're truly amazing!",0
"We have only been here two nights so far but already love it. The staff are very accommodating and friendly and nothing is too much of an ask. The hotel/apartments are beautiful, clean, quirky, cool and intimate. The pool area is super clean and I cannot describe how amazing it is laying out looking over the sea on a sunny afternoon. Beach is only a 5 minute walk away which gives a great opportunity to explore local life. There are about 4 mini market shops too within a 5 minute walk which is handy. The drinks at the hotel are quite expensive so we have purchased some from the shops to keep in the room. The pizza was delicious and reasonably priced and was enough for two. The beds/pillows/sun loungers are so comfy!! The breakfast has been very tasty too and offers a range of cereals, pastries and hot food. Well done Pelican. A great scene :) x",0
"We stayed 3 nights. The hotel is nice, very clean and we had a fantastic sea view from our room. The staff was excellent and experienced. The location is 5 minutes from the town and 2 minutes from a wonderful beach. We hope to come back soon !!! Congratulations !",0
"Fantastic place to stay, about 5 mins walk to the beach. Bus stop into Mykonos close by. Very quiet and staff are fantastic. We were offered an upgrade without asking. Not often we order room service, in this case the food was excellent.",0
We arrived to friendly staff and we were early. We got into our room earlier than check in time and the room was beautiful. We were impressed with the gym and breakfast was fantastic. The barman made the best cocktails! Would recommend the cute little beach down the road too.,0
"My experience at pelican bay was absolutely amazing. The staff made us feel welcome right away, in specific there are two brothers that work there and they are wonderful. The rooms were very clean as well!",0
"This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The rooms, the staff, the location - everything was perfect! Really did not want to come home. The staff were so helpful, the rooms were large and very clean and the food and drink were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",0
"This hotel is super special in so many ways... huge rooms with magnificent views, super clean and styled to perfection.. staff are super friendly and helpful.. food delicious and very reasonable, we had room service on our balcony three times, was as good as any of the restaurants and a fraction of the price..close to beach and bus stop into mykonos town, highly recommend this hotel and would not stay anywhere else on mykonos..",0
"The staff were very friendly and helpful. Giving unbiased information about the different tours on offer. Our room was clean and we had a fabulous view from our balcony. The beach, restaurants, markets and local bus are about a 10 minute walk away. The staff were very helpful in forwarding my camera oonto my next destination.",0
We had an excellent stay!!!The place was great and the environment very beautiful.The view was astonishing and the staff was very friendly. The rooms were very neat and tidy and the nearby beach was unforgettable!!,0
"We got this hotel as part of a deal and it was basically cheap especially compared to other hotels on the island. I have stayed at several properties on the island and this one ranks amongst the best ones. We normally stayed in town and this is the first time near a beach. The location is very nice, quiet great beach and close to town (15 minute scooter ride)",0
Vety Friendly warm and welcoming lovely surroundings with an eye for detsil and art. Food was delicious meals and cocktails always presented by the pool with csre and attention thanks for the fabulous break sway,0
"First off, we had a transfer from the port to the hotel which costed us 10euros per person, which I suppose is decent considering the convenience. We were welcomed to the hotel and the reception had some drinks and snacks for you to nibble on while waiting for your group leader to check in. The lobby has a couch opposite a glass window which is really good for taking pictures (specifically for girls lol)Anyway, the rooms and the toilets are lovely, comfortable, clean and spacious. Apart from that, the swimming pool is really nice and the bartender called Zannis is super friendly. Beer is of course more expensive than a supermarket but 4euros for a small bottle is still pretty decent. The breakfast is decent as well, nothing too fancy but nothing I can complain about either, just a typical continental breakfast, sort of. The receptionist is extremely helpful. She gave us detailed information on directions and places to visit. She is also able to arrange transportation for you if needed as well as calling the ATV (i.e. quads) company (if you plan to rent one) which will send one of their guys to the hotel and bring you to their shop. On a side note, having a motor license is good if you want the lower cc quads to save money (you'd need to hire the larger cc quads if you only have a car license). However, you can rent quads nearby the hotel (2 mins walk) which would overlook the car license bit. Also, the receptionist recommended us a restaurant called nikos gallop which is roughly 3-5 mins walk and we were not disappointed with the food here at all!All in all, if you can, this hotel will not disappoint you in any way. It even has a 9.1/10 rating in bo-kings.c-m! Again, on the side note, rent a quad!",0
Great service. Staff very friendly especially around pool area and restaurant. Close to beach bus is easy to go to town. Clean rooms very private balconies. Very quiet pool was fantastic. Restaurant very reasonable,0
"We travelled as a family (grandparents, mom and 5 year old) and took 2 rooms. The rooms are comfortable and clean and decorated beautifully. In room coffee maker is a plus! (and one we found rare in Greece). Breakfast is lovely and the pool side bar does meals throughout the day at good prices. Beautiful pool (though a little more shade would be nice). 5 minute walk to beach, restaurants and convenience store as well as local bus that takes you into Mykonos town. Cold refreshments in the afternoon in the lobby as well as a laptop for quick email check (for those who decide to leave home without their electronic devices). Staff are friendly and helpful. This was my favorite stay in Greece.   Room Tip: We had rooms on the main floor close to reception w/ large balconies. Rooms were low so no view of t... See more room tips",0
"We took two rooms , great location , short walk to the beach. Really nice rooms , clean , comfortable . Fantastic breakfast , very clean kitchen . Family run and nothing is a problem for them to please. I would recommend a stay here for sure. Water has good pressure and is hot , rooms are cleaned and no sewage smells.",0
This boutique hotel is in a wonderful location with spotless rooms and views. The pool and pool bar are well managed with friendly staff. Reception and Management are kind and helpful. Would stay again without doubt and will be telling all our friends. The rooms are generous in size and have extra pillows. The Wifi is fast which made my daughters very happy:) a short stroll is motorbike hire an ATM beach and restaurants including Thea our favorite.,0
"My friends and I took a 2 week trip around Europe and stayed in a total of 6 hotels, and this was by far our favorite. The suites are beautiful and located on top of a hill with a gorgeous ocean view, and the staff is incredible. We love Zannis and Petros!!! We are already planning our next trip back to Mykonos so we can stay here.",0
Nice hotel small clean cute rooms. Nice view. Great breakfast. Not close to main shopping need to take public bus or taxi. Overall didn't really care for Mykonos but hotel was okay. Close to beach with very little free access need to rent chairs.,0
"We loved our stay at Pelican Bay! The staff was accommodating and friendly! The hotel was extremely clean, tastefully decorated with white crisp and airy decor. The breakfast was good, and the location is perfect! Close to the beach and bus into town for shopping and dining. Would definitely return for another stay and recommend this hotel to others!",0
"My wife and I stayed at the Pelican Bay Art hotel for 4 nights from the 20th June 16 and wished we could have stayed longer. Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff and wonderful location.All of the staff were so friendly, attentive and attention to detail was second to none.Our room (402) had a beautiful view from the balcony where you could watch the multi million pounds yachts and the blue waters of the Aegean.The room was spotlessly clean with towels changed daily, excellent AC and safe deposit box in the room. The only downside was the small shower cubicle and half glass shower screen which meant the water flooded the floor. As everything else was perfect about the hotel we did not make any fuss over this small issue.5 minutes walk to the beautiful beach (15 euros for sunbeds) and some great restaurants, Try Yialo, Yialo, great food, prices and service.The hotel is only minutes away from the bus stop into Mykonos Town (1euro 80) each way or 10 euros in a taxi. At night the taxi is well worth the extra cost. Breakfast choice was very good but not keen on chips for breakfast, lol. Excellent yogurt with fresh honey, homemade bread and choice of pastries.Excellent service from both breakfast staff members, always smiling and very friendly.We would certainly recommend this hotel and having stayed at another hotel in Mykonos (5 star) during our vacation, Pelican Bay was miles ahead.Thanks to all staff for a great holiday.",0
"We have just spent seven days at the fabulous Pelcan Bay Art Hotel. From the moment we arrived we felt the hospitality that we received was second to none, nothing was too much trouble. All the staff from reception desk, in particular bar and restaurant staff Petros and Zannis made our holiday extra special. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the rooms are well equipped with wonderful views. Beaches and fabulous tavernas are a ten minute walk away. Our stay exceeded our expectations, we will definately return. Our compliments to Antonis for the wonderful job both you and your staff are doing. Thank you. Larry and Cathy Nice",0
"Excellent people are workingAt Pelican Bay Art hotel. Always there to help you, always there for a chat. It was our second time there and it s like going back home. Petros never complained to stay behind the bar until 2 am and he is an amazing cocktail maker although I was only drink Campari or sambuva",0
"Over all A pleasant stay, I would highly recommend this hotel And I would return!!Pleasant greetings, easy to walk to And from the beach, picturesque location!Privacy if you need it, excellent staff advise!",0
"Just returned from a weeks stay at the Art Hotel Pelican Bay in Mykonos. Have to say that it was one of the best holidays we have ever had - and much of this was down to the wonderful staff at the Pelican Bay. From the moment we arrived, everyone from the hotel manager to the receptionists to the fabulous brothers ( Petros and Zannis ) ,who worked in the hotel bar/restaurant, provided impeccable service which epitomised everything that people say about Greek hospitality. Their attention to detail, customer service, sense of humour and friendliness could not be beaten anywhere - and this from someone who has travelled the world. As we said to our friends, we honestly felt that we were the private guests at a friends house rather than merely staying in a hotel - and I'm sure others felt the same. In addition to all of the above, the hotel itself is perfect. Spotlessly clean ( think Cruise Ship standards ), with bedding/towels/even complimentary dressing gowns seemingly changed every time we left the room, gorgeous and very spacious rooms and great views. And 2 minutes walk to the local bus, 5 minutes from Platys Yialos beach with its very classy beach side restaurants and bars, 10 minutes from another couple of great beaches and a 10 minute bus or taxi ride from the beautiful main town. Both ourselves and our friends felt that we were experiencing a "" millionaires "" holiday ( just look at the boats and you will see what we mean ) at a ridiculously affordable price. We will definitely return and many of our friends are already clamouring to book. It was that good. 5 star all the way.",0
"We were 100% satisfied with our stay at this hotel. The employees were so kind and accommodating, the hotel itself was incredibly well kept, and the breakfast was delicious! We can't wait to plan another trip to Mykonos and stay here!",0
"We are just enjoying the last of a four night stay at this hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff, rooms are spotlessly clean with great comfy beds. Beautiful clean pool and bar area, meals and drinks lovely and well priced.Short walk to beaches,great resturaunts, great location with a half hourly bus service into Mykonos only a short walk away at the top of the hill.",0
"We had a great stay here. Food, service, rooms and a wonderful bartender! My daughter and I were here for two nights and had a great time. Would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Mykonos. Thanks!",0
"Excellent place to stay. Location is great with a 5 minute walk to the bus stop, then 15 minute bus ride into town. The staff are lovely, always there to help. The pool and pool bar are a great feature too.Would recommend staying here.",0
"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Rooms were very clean and well-equipped. Beautiful artwork and decor. Great food and service at the pool. The staff was amazing with excellent restaurant recommendations. I would stay here again any day! I sent an email to the hotel requesting a better room as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary. They gave us a great suite overlooking the pool and with the beach in the background. Upon arrival, we had a wonderful chocolate cake in our room together with 2 bottles of water and 2 sparkling ouzo drinks (all compliments of the hotel). Very comfortable and nice place. Great location near the beach and local tavernas. Also close to a great car rental place.",0
This was honestly the best place to stay on Mykonos Island. Hotel facilities & staff were just awesome. So friendly & helpful and close to everything! Hired a quad to get around and it was the most fun way to see the island & its prestigious beaches.,0
"A friend and I recently stayed at the Pelican Bay Art Hotel and really enjoyed it. Reception staff was really welcoming and helpful when it came to recommending places to go, how to get there, and answer any of our questions. The room was not only extremely clean, but spacious as well. The only small setback was the AC at first, but we let the reception know and 5 minutes later we had someone come and help us fix it. Would totally recommend staying here due to the aforementioned characteristics and the location.",0
Nice quite location and amazing staff and they surprised us with a nice cake and drinks for our honeymoon. This was our favourite hotel to stay at out of the 4 islands that we had visited. Food was really good breakfast was amazing with a variety of items.,0
I found an oasis of calm and relaxation .All services were excellent.All pesonalul was courteous and provided all the necessary information .The location is dreamy and excursions are unforgettable and energizes you .I highly recommend you to spend your holiday in Mykonos at Pelican Bay Art Hotel,0
"Nice hotel Close to platis Gialos by foot, clean rooms Very Nice view, wonderful staffBest hotel in mykonos, great breakfast , even babysitting for my baby of 20 months old, very quiet, definitively we Will go back",0
"We stayed in June 2016, hotels and service was excellent. Thank you for the great stay. They were very accommodating to us as we travelled with a 1.5 year old. All employees were super friendly and great. Short walk to the bus stop.",0
Excellent the reception staff were so friendly & helpful she organized a hairdresser & a tour she was great. Thanks.The rooms were very comfortable & the porters were good also barman at the pool was great & clean & cool,0

"This was our second stay the last being in 2014. Just as in our first stay, everyone made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Antonines, the Hotel Manager, Petros and his brother, Zannis who run the bar and restaurant are totally committed to making sure our stay exceeded our expectations. The location is perfect as it is off the main road for peaceful sleeping but so convenient to all the beaches, restaurants and a quick bus ride into Town. There were several days that we stayed at the hotel enjoying the fitness room, great pool and lounging area and excellent food and drinks. Rest assured we are looking forward to returning to visit our friends at our home away from home.",0
"The hotel is in a very good location, near to a beautiful beach and nice restaurants.Very calm area. The staff was very kind and the rooms were very clean. We would definitely come back to this hotel",0
"Loved attention to details, friendly helpful service. Views were magnificent and we were fortunate to have glorious weather. The Villa is constructed on several levels, so it helps to work-off the home-cooked delightful breakfasts!",0
"Pelican Bay is THE best hotel to stay when in Mykonos. We had the most amazing trip for a third year running, this time with all our family & friends for our WEDDING (62 of us)! We are so blessed to have our Greek friends here at Pelican Bay - who all contributed and made our wedding even more special. We wouldn't have held our wedding anywhere but Mykonos and we wouldn't have stayed anywhere else but at Pelican Bay! Thank you to Antonis (Our Wedding Planner & the best manager) for everything you helped us with - Greek dancers, transfers, cars, my dress and most of all for your caring and generous nature. Antonis even went out of his way to decorate the hotel for us, it was so beautiful! We are friends for life and we can't wait to come back already! We love you xxxThank you to Marianna and Angeliki - you have been a warm smile and welcome to us again. You two are amazing! Marianna thank you for being a guest at out wedding, it was an honour to have you with us! xxxThank you to Petros, you still amaze us with your incredible cocktails, great humour and never ending hard work. You are THE BEST barman, so attentive & you really know how to look after us all. We love you xxxThanks you also to Zannis, Ornella, Kapil, Kostas and ALL the amazing maids (who kept our room so clean and tidy). You are the BEST team and we are so lucky to have met you all. You are our Greek family and we hope/wish you all the best for a GREAT season & for the future. Hopefully we'll see you again soon, Love Mrs & Mrs Buller xxxxxx",1
"This hotel can’t be faulted, the staff were fantastic and the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard. The hotel was busy but we never once struggled to get a sunbed around the pool! 10/10 from us, we would certainly stay here again in the future.",1
Lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable send breakfast was good. Amazing pool area with bar and restaurant providing delicious meals. Situated close to beaches and restaurants with car/scooter/quadbike rentals around the corner. I would love to go back!,0
"This is a fabulous hotel, in our opinion- a GEM, the most Gorgeous Establishment in Mykonos. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were courteous, diligent and very efficient. We had a superior room which was suberb, spotlessly clean and offered all the amenities you could wish for including tea, coffee, toiletries, hairdryer, bath-robes, fluffy towels, comfortable beds etc, etc. Breakfast was a mix of hot and cold, Zannis and Ornella ensured you had everything you needed, and were polite and very helpful. The lovely Pedros managed the pool bar and made the most fabulous cocktails, and never kept you waiting. The pool bar was ideal for reasonably priced yet very tasty snacks and offered fresh pool towels. Antonis is the owner, and is the loveliest and most flamboyant person you could meet. The Pelican Bay Art hits my 'top hotels' list, I hope one day to return",0
"We had an amazing time in Mykonos. There were 6 of us traveling together, and we all loved this hotel. The breakfast was yummy, the staff was nice… oh and the bartender made the most amazing drinks at night by the pool! When returning, no doubt, i'll be staying here again!",0
"I Just loved everything about this is hotel, the room was very clean and well presented, with a fabulous view. What made it was the ALL the staff specially Petros and Zannis (at the bar), really looked after us and helped to make the holiday very special. Thank you.I defiantly would recommend this hotel and we will hopefully return.",0
"My husband and I stayed at pelican bay for three nights during our honeymoon. The hotel was beautiful, the rooms were clean and the staff was pleasant and helpful. I not only would stay there again, but I would recommend them to all my friends and family. Thank yoh so much for a wonderful stay!",0
stayed here for 3 dayswhat a fabulous quaint clean pretty hotel.Friendly staffvery very comfortable beds...with decent pillowsand lots of personal touches.Would highly recommend and will definitely go backClose to a fabulous beach and bus stop to Mykonos town,0
"A memorable stay. It ticked every box and more....from the entrance, cleanliness, immaculate presentation, thoughtful attention to detail, food and service. The staff were so willing to please, especially Petros, who served us drinks by the pool and served great food. He was happy to talk about all sorts of subjects, whether cultural, agricultural, political or musical. Platys Gialos is a 10 minute drive from the port and there is a local bus and beach about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We are two sisters in our mid sixties and fairly active and social. We have been to other hotels in Greece and this is streets ahead. We suggest you put The Pelican Bay Art Hotel on your itinerary.",0
"The hotel were so welcoming and accommodating. Got to know a lot of the staff personally and they were always so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely return. Rooms were cleaned on a daily basis. Amazing view of the bay from balcony. 5 minute walk to beach, water taxis and bus stop.",0
We enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were tidy and grounds were lovely. The pool bar hosts an amazing and friendly bartender. It's in walking distance of the local beach and a bus ride to anywhere you need to go on the island.,0
"We spent five nights at the hotel at the end of July. The hotel is in a lovely position with a glorious view. The room was nice but, because of its location there wasn't a great deal of natural light which made it rather dark. Everything was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Whilst the shower area was really spacious, the shower itself was the hand held type, I feel that this is not acceptable in a hotel of this standard. Breakfast was first class with a fantastic selection of hot and cold food, and drinks.The lovely gentleman in the restaurant was always ready with our coffee/tea as soon as he saw us coming into the restaurant, we absolutely loved breakfast time! The pool area is beautiful, lovely food and drinks are available at the bar - the club sandwich is amazing!!We had dinner in the restaurant on one of the evenings, and had an outstanding meal, we did feel that the wine was rather overpriced.All of the hotel staff were fantastic, so helpful and professional. The gorgeous receptionist was very helpful, telling us about the area and organising car hire for us. Special mention must go to the amazing Roland! He picked us up from the airport, giving us lots of local information during the journey to the hotel. We were travelling on to Santorini by ferry after our stay on Mykonos, Roland picked our tickets up the day before, we were so grateful to him, not least of all because the port is very busy and this saved us a lot of hassle. The transfer cost €24 return per person, we felt this was very reasonable.The closest beach is Kalo Livadi beach, it is lovely but very busy. 2 sun beds and an umbrella cost either €30 or €50 per day. We found this price was pretty commonplace around the island, we weren't at all impressed with this!! My advice is to check cost before you sit down anywhere! We have travelled extensively in Greece and have never come across cost like this, honestly- I think it's pretty unacceptable!! We spent most of our time on a lovely beach, (I think it's called Kalafatis), turn right out of the hotel, up the hill, turn left then first right downhill, it's about a 15-20 minute walk. We had free beds in front of Petrino Restaurant. We also ate lunch and dinner in the restaurant, the food is very good, and reasonably priced and the staff are great. A word of advice, if you decide to head here to eat in the evening, organise to get there and back before dark because it's a bit hairy walking the road in the dark!!I'd definitely recommend hiring a car to see the island. Mykonos town is well worth visiting, with lots of interesting little shops, and loads of great restaurants which are much better value for money than those found outside of the capital.We visited Super Paradise Beach, we didn't spend a lot of time here because it is really busy but it's worth seeing. We had lunch here, the self service restaurant at first sight looks like a school cafeteria but don't be put off!! The food is really good, plenty choice of cold and hot meals and snacks , and very good quality.This was our first visit to Mykonos, it's a very interesting island indeed! It's really windy but I loved this because you never felt too hot. Many of the people we spoke to described it as a party island- I think this describes it rather well. Outside of Mykonos Town food and drink prices are very high, this would be fine if you were having high quality but this wasn't generally the case - (apart from the lovely Petrino restaurant I've already mentioned). We enjoyed our visit but we're pretty glad that we decided to only have 5 nights on Mykonos, and to be honest, 3 nights would probably have been better.If you do decide to visit, the Archipelagos Hotel would be an excellent choice.   Room Tip: Ask for a sea view See more room tips",1
"After a years break we came back. This hotel keeps on improving. Food was excellent, rooms and facilities are much better with the renovation and staff friendly and professional. We will definitely come back.",1
"We stayed at Archipelagos in August for 8 days.We had the most amazing time.The hotel is beautiful and peaceful. My children loved exploring the grounds. The staff and owner are very kind and helpful. They gave us tips on where to go, what to visit, and where to find the best beaches. They were also so kind to our children. The food was excellent. My kids loved the beef burgers and the pasta dishes. Breakfast was great too. Many healthy choices for me but also many nice options for my two sons. They had several slices of cake every day! The hotel has a great location and a great view. All the rooms are beautiful and the grounds are as well. I loved the decor.We hope to visit Archipelagos and the island of Mykonos again.It was one of our best family vacations. It was amazing!",1
"We spent a perfect week at the end of July as a couple at the Archipelagos. We were looking for a week of rest, peace and recuperation and the Archipelagos provided this. Lovely room, gorgeous view, amazing food, super friendly staff and a relaxed peaceful atmosphere. Our favourite part of the day was breakfast when the choice was plentiful and the food and drinks where gorgeous. It was a real treat every day and we sure do miss it!! For couples looking for a week of rest the Archipelagos is a perfect destination. For those wanting an active holiday a car would definately be needed to get around the island.",1
"We are a family of three and paid 450€ per night for a room with balcony and sea view. To be fair everything in Mykonos at this time of year is ridiculously expensive. But still, one cannot be happy when Internet wifi connection is extremely slow (and almost inexistent in the room), when you must pay for a second coffee at breakfast, when the washbasin is rusted (look attached picture), when the pool water is suspiciously not 100% clear, when many other smaller details denote a 3.5-star hotel... It is not altogether bad, the view is beautiful, some of the staff of course are very nice people, but when you pay this amount of money you expect much better facilities and a lot more professional service.",1
"Beautifully set family hotel, the staff is wonderful, the restaurant simply surprising and delicious, the view gorgeous and the beaches next door are beautiful but:- the suite we had was pretty and a good view but little details are off : room smelled of cat pee and reception did nothing about it, the bathtub is installed the wrong way making it uncomfortable to shower, no hot water at peak hours. When we asked to change room , we were told it was unavailable , when I found it available , we were given excuses.. And there was garbage next to the roomIt's a good hotel but needs to change a few things to be worth the price",0
"Had such a wonderful holiday for 4 nights with some girlfriends here. The hotel was classy, chic and just what we wanted. The staff work throughout the day to ensure the place is pristine. Food was top notch and we enjoyed eating tasty, healthy food. Breakfast was gorgeous - really enjoyed the variety and cute little extras including the mini bottles of milk with straws and detox waters. Loved the Turkish Delights and chocolate pebbles too! The lady behind the bar in the day was lovely - I wish I'd taken her name. Lady in the spa was rude and literally shouted at us for using too many towels! She didn't ruin our experience though so not fair to damage the review because of her bitterness. Taxi driver for the hotel was so sweet and couldn't do enough. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Taxis at night are sparse so beware. Would possibly stay nearer nightlife if we went back. A a 32 year old lady who likes the nicer things in life, I'd budget €100 a day here or a little extra if having a heavy night out.",0
"This hotel was very friendly and is family owned. The view from our hotel was incredible which over looks the Aegean. Excellent service, friendly, hospitable, great morning breakfasts, etc... We will definitely come back on our next trip.",1
"A lovely stay here with my husband and our 2 year old. Beautiful beach and restaurants nearby and at the hotel. Staff were always polite, friendly and around to help. Lovely warm welcome and ice cold welcome drinks! Will be back X",0
"We spent four days at Archipelagos. Everything was perfect! Family owned, attention to details and excellent service! 2 min from the best beach on the island: Kalo Livadi and 15min from Mykonos town (Chora). The place is quiet and relaxing. The room was spacious, very clean and with a large balcony with fantastic sea view. Breakfast is great with a large variety of food and beverages. Highly recommended!",1
"Once again we decided to stay to this beautiful hotel for our family vacation at Mykonos having in mind our last years holidays there and our magic memories!!Believe us every year the family owners keep surprising us !They always improve and move ahead from all the other luxury hotels!!A superb new suite with jacuzzi and a wonderful decoration makes your stay at the hotel unique !The chef Giannis keeps impressing is with his new delicious ideas and the 'fine dinning' which is a must to have!The family owners are always around to check if everything is close to perfection and they really succeed !What else can I say...beautiful people making you feel at home!!!Congratulations Tonia and Kostantine,we really can't wait for our next stay at your sweet palace!",1
"Our family of four enjoyed a 3 day stay at the Archipelagos Hotel. The staff were excellent - particularly helping us track down a bag that had been lost by the airline. Room was well set up with parents sleeping upstairs and our boys on ground floor. Location was very good - a short walk to 2 different beaches. The hotel organised a hire car for us so we could explore the island - we took a beach to Nammos for the day which was lots of fun. We enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel. Produce was excellent and the chef made a pony of meeting all the guests to determine special requests. All in all relaxed luxury and highly recommended.",2
"Myself and my 2 daughters (17 and 20) stayed at the Archipelagos in July for a week. From the moment we arrived we felt incredibly welcome. The drinks that we were given became a staple for my daughters, a still lemon drink with mint, very refreshing. The hotel is sat on a hill, with individual rooms set amongst the fabulous grounds. We had a family room which boasted a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace and had shading provided by stunning pink bougainvillea. The room was spacious, plenty of room for the 3 of us. The absolutely best bit was the bathroom though. An enclosed wet room with a large rainfall shower, great water pressure and with a constant supply of hot water. The breakfast buffet is amazing, fresh bread, homemade jams and preserves, smoothies, hot and cold options. It was a struggle to pick what to have every morning. The restaurant also offers lunch and dinner. We ate there 3 times for dinner and every meal was excellent. We even received a complimentary starter one night because the chef was trying out a new dish. The staff cannot do enough for you, they are ready to accommodate your every need and work so hard every day. A special mention to Tanya at the pool bar who makes the most delicious cocktails and no skimping on the measures either. I simply cannot fault this hotel. For a relaxing, sun drenched holiday with breathtaking views from the comfort of your sun bed you cannot pick a better place to stay.",3
"Earlier reviewers said it all: Excellent, amazing, recommended. I couldn't agree more! I have, however, to stress that lunching and dining at Archipelagos is an experience by itself. It's not only the beautiful presentation of ALL the dishes that compliment the picturesque view of the Aegean Sea. It is the impeccable and unique combinations of raw materials which elevate the taste experience to new levels. The Chef clearly visualises the end feeling and creates art, art that one can taste and appreciate. My sincere compliments!",1
Beautiful setting with delicious food and personalised service. The staff are extremely helpful and go out of their way to ensure your visit is perfect. Our luggage had been lost and the receptionist called Athens airport numerous times a day on our behalf to see if there was any update. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Breakfast was absolutely delicious with many Greek dishes on offer. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to visit Mykonos.,1
"Not a first time visitor I came to this lovely hotel. A welcome drink and all information from the first time. A good parking place and constant WiFi are some of the plus of this family run hotel. From the first time in the hotel you are enjoying the privilege of not just another client but as a family member. The breakfast is a mixing of Greek and international delicacies. Coffees and fresh juices with some detox waters combined our breakfast. The staff is always with a smile and helpful. Clean and you can enjoy a comfortable meal or lunch in the restaurant. Every plate is a combination of mediterranean cuisine with modern twist. From the barwoman Mrs Tanya until the reception girls the staff is the pro of this unique design hotel. Enjoy the fresh water swimming pool, fresh lemonade and easy going to your room. Everything clean and the housekeeper is always helpful to satisfy our needs. Nevertheless the room are comfortable, clean with all amenities. It is not the complicated hotel but is one of a mind breaking hotel into the blue and the mykonian wind. The owners of this hotels are one of the friendliest persons that someone can see from the first time. Always there to statisfy every need. The chef of the cuisine a kind and noble man. The waiters ready to make your holiday dreamy. Worth every penny and euro this lovely hotel in Kalo Livadi. It has nothing more or less than a 5 star hotel in the area.",2
"To put it simple, fast and worthy: it was awesome, extraordinary and totally perfect. My girlfriend and I loved the rooms with seaview, a spacious Veranda and the wonderfulla designed pool area. Have a drink at the Poolbar with Tania: she knows what/s best: with drinks and around the Island. Try the food: probably you won/t find any other place with dinner at this Level of excellence on the whole Island: thanks to Yannis and his kitchen staff. All in all: we had loved to stay longer and will come back. Thanks to the whole team of Tonia and Kostas: this place is a jewel, a gem ... staff members are friends. everybody feels instantly like home - a Superlative of Holiday experience ... thanks for everything!   Room Tip: Ask for a room in back up the hill .... a little bit above pool area with a fabulous view ... we j... See more room tips",1
"We just left and are on our way to the airport.This hotel is absolutely amazing. Beautiful decor, spacious, comfortable but the thing that sets it aspect from other great hotels is the staff and the service.From the second you arrive to the time you leave you get the feeling that everyone genuinely cares about you and making sure you have the perfect holiday. Nothing is too much trouble, from Roland who will drop you and pick you up as required, to the receptionist who is probably the most helpful lady of all time, to the bar and restaurant staff who can't do enough, this hotel is as close to perfect as it comes.If your wavering and not sure where to book... take my word for it, book here.",2
"The hotel itself is beautiful with a pool looking out to the ocean. On the first day we decided to try the restaurant at the hotel and was pleasantly surprised with a really delicious salmon burger. The staff is very helpful in terms of making dinner reservations, booking cars, and providing general advice. The only downside is that the hotel is a bit far from Mykonos town (20 mins car). Which would be fine if Mykonos wasn't incredibly difficult to navigate without a car/quad bikes. The buses run every two hours from designated stops, which was a little inconvenient. But if you decide to rent a car ($50/day) or a quad bike ($25/day), this is a perfect, relaxing hotel for family and couples.",1
"This is a little gem of a hotel, it's not a chain and is an authentic Mykonian hotel hidden away from the town (15min hotel bus ride) that is a must if you are looking for something away from party area. We had a sea view room which was spacious, naturally well lit and always cleaned whenever we returned to the room. Rooms are air conditioned and beds firm and super comfortable.We highly recommend booking the breakfast with your room, it is worth it and we always started our day with a lazy breakfast, whilst enjoying the view of the Aegean. The options are plentiful, fresh, healthy and always served with a smile. The pool is medium sized but typical of hotel pools on the greek islands. There were enough beds for everyone to be around the pool at all times of the day. Note the pool is not heated but comfortable at the beginning of June and serves cocktails all day long. Music is played by the pool which adds ambience but is not intrusive. There are a couple of beaches close to the hotel but we prefered the ""unorganised"" beach about 100m from the hotel at the bottom of the hill - take towels from the hotel and a parasol if there is one spare. A few other guests did the same. The restaurant is great with very tasty dishes and the chef will cater to your needs; we had a vegan in the group and my wife was pregnant. We ate lunch a couple of times and had dinner in the evening a couple of times too. Great work Yiannis!We would say that main reason why we will return to this hotel is the service. It was fantastic and the were always genuinely interested in your stay and always looking to help. A few mentions: Kian - for his mutli-lingual chat, smile and all round great service and local recommendations. Roland - great transfers and local knowledge as well as recommendations.George - for your service during breakfast and dinner, you were great.Eva & Tania - for great service behind the bar and Eva at breakfast!Foris - for your service during breakfast. We saw very few children at the hotel but a good mix of people with a few more mid 20s to mid 30s couples.",3
From the first moment we arrived everything was great. The room was well designed and very clean. Breakfast was very good and tasty and buffet was stylish. Food in room service was excellent . The view from our patio and from the pool was beautiful. And service was all you could ask for. We would definitely visit again!,1
"I have stayed in Archipelagos Hotel several times and every time is better than the others . It is a place where you can relax and enjoy every minute you spend. Spacious rooms perfectly decorated , majestic views , excellent breakfast , super cocktails around the pool !!!Last but not least ....super restaurant!!! Yiannis , is one of the most talented chefs. Delicious and sophisticated plates !!!",0
"So far, this hotel was definetely my best choice I ever made for Mykonos in terms of location! Mornings and evenings here will always be remembered: wonderful view, cool design, very good services and friendly people. Highly recommended for those who want to avoid the crowded Mykonos Town, that is 15 minutes away by car. Book this hotel + rent a small car = your perfect vacation in Mykonos!",0
We stay at many luxury collection hotels and we were very impressed by the service we received here. The attention to detail is amazing. The warmth and care of the staff is incredible. The staff made us feel like we came to someone's private home. The facility is very clean and beautiful and located in a beautiful setting !!!! I highly recommend this place.,0
"Stayed here with my boyfriend for 10 amazing days. The hotel is absolutely stunning...the view from the room, the attention to small details, the style ....the food...the best in the whole island. Credit to a young and very talented chef,Giannis,!! The food presentation and the choice of fresh and organic local ingredients makes the food divine. The breakfast buffet is exceptionally good...a lot to choose from...if you stay there you need to eat at the restaurant and experience how amazing it is. The best food experience by far! Giannis made special food for me that wasnt on the menu just becouse of my special diet requirements... his passion for his job is so clear and also you can see how happy he is just to please his guests..in fact what made the whole experience memorable are the whole team working at the hotel! Each and every of them has what it takes to makes everyone experience memorable. Irene at the reception was our first great impression extremely professional and so helpful...George at the Restaurant is very special, kind and passionate about his job always happy and friendly. Kian, Fotis and Christof amazing and helpful guys...One of the was sharing with us his i pod charger that we forgot at home! Eva at the bar...a very special girl...so hard working! The maintenance guy fixing my boyfriend shoes.....I am sure i forgot someone and i am sorry if I did so...Well all I can say is that this is a wonderful place ...a little gem in Mykonos that would made anyone holidays so special.I work for the hotel industry myself and I have never seen such happy and enthusiastic team. The owner and manager of this place is extremely lucky to have them!",1
"We have been staying with our children at this beautiful, charming and relaxing small hotel and we suggest you, if you are planning to visit Mykonos, to take into consideration this hotel for your stay! Breakfast is fantastic and the chef, young and skilled, make nice dishes, simple and tasty! The rooms are beautiful and the service is very good!! We highly recommend it!!",1
"My husband and I have just returned from our first trip to Archipelagos and what a fantastic time we had! The staff really make the experience and can't do enough to make your stay special. The food in the hotel restaurant is gorgeous and sometimes the chef will experiment with dishes off of the menu to cater for what you fancy.We hired a car for our stay and would thoroughly recommend doing this if you are staying for more than a few nights. It meant we could venture into Mykonos Town, other beaches etc... The beach club a short walk from the hotel, Solymar is lovely but is not anywhere near as good as Scorpios which in our opinion has a much cooler vibe (and is actually a lot better priced. 40 euros for 2 sunbeds under a cabana).I would highly recommend this hotel for couples or friends looking for a relaxing holiday.",1
"Booked this hotel via Secret Escapes and had an amazing experience, upgraded to a one bed duplex suite with sea view which was amazing. Although only 40 rooms this hotel is unique as you feel you're staying in a little village with its windy pathways and lush, well manicured gardens. Each apartment set are different and all access the facilities. Staff are super friendly at all meals and especially on the bar. The hotel is a five minute walk away from the brilliant Solymar beach club which is great. I'd definitely recommend the Archipelagos hotel and the location and will be returning for certain.",1
We spent a fantastic week in May 2016 in the Archipelagos hotel on Mykonos. The hotel is relatively small (around 40 rooms) and is located at a very calm bay with a beautiful beach. The staff is very friendly and helpful (thank you again Cian!). The food in the hotel restaurant is very good with a good price value. Most of the rooms have great sea views. This is the perfect location for a relaxing holiday.,1
"We have just returned from the fabulous Archipelagos for the 2nd year running. Our first was fabulous and our 2nd just as amazing. From start to finish all the staff make you feel like a member of the family. Dimitris helped me with my reservation and was so accommodating with all my requests. Once again the brilliant Roland shuttled us around the island ( a complimentary service at mid day and at 9pm if you want to go to Mykonos City).I felt quite emotional having to leave today and say goodbye to everyone, that is how special they make you feel. If you are thinking of visiting Mykonos, please stay at The Archipelagos. The rooms are beautiful, with stunning views of Kalo Livadi, we stayed in room 122 this year and 423 last year, both equally as good with beautiful sea views from both. The chef Giannis is fabulous. He would always come and chat to us and make sure everything was ok with our food. He truly is a credit to the hotel and is genuinely a lovely person also. He is so passionate about his cooking, which i would rate as the best in Mykonos!! A huge thank you to Kostas and Tonia once again, you run a beautiful hotel and You must both be so proud of your team, they truly are all amazing!! We will be returning to the Archipelagos once again next year, we now think of it as our home from home. Natalie & Chris Jones",1
"We had a wonderful stay my kids and I, and if we can we will definitely go back.I can only recommend this beautiful Hotel.The service was excellent from all staff. And the team is amazingly friendly.Breakfast is great, food is very good, atmosphere is perfect.Special thanks and regards to Irini, Eva, Fotis, Georges, Kian!Wishing you a very good season!",1
"Archipelagos hotel is an absolute gem! The staff, service and surroundings are excellent and it's located in the quieter part of the island on the south east coast so it's very peaceful, perfect for relaxing.The hotel is a short walk away from Kalo Livadi beach and Kalafatis beach, where there is also a mini market, or alternatively if you feel like stretching your legs and walking to the nearest town, Ano Mera, for more shops and restaurants, it's roughly a 30 min walk. We hired quad bikes for a couple of days (hire costs €25 per day, plus €10 for insurance and another €10 to fill the tank up with petrol) to explore the island and I would highly recommend doing so as the best beaches are located on the south coast and are not really within walking distances. The hotel also provides a free shuttle into Mykonos town centre twice daily which is really handy, and all of the friendly staff hold a wealth of knowledge on places to visit and things to do and see. The food and drinks at the hotel are delicious and very reasonably priced (cheaper than most places on the island) and the buffet breakfast provided each morning is wonderful! We stayed in an executive suite which was situated at the top of the hotel complex and had the most beautiful views from our private terrace.A wonderful hotel with wonderful friendly staff, cannot recommend this place enough and would definitely stay here again!",0
"I loved everything about this hotel and this stay. The boutique hotel is beautiful, my room faced the sea, the hotel is quiet. Breakfast was lovely too. The only slight down side was that the hotel is a fair distance from the town and bars but loved the hotel.",0
"Fabulous little oasis. Excellent service from all of the staff who made us feel very welcome and very pampered. The food was fabulous and reasonably priced for a luxury hotel. Rooms are large, clean and comfortable. Absolutely loved the interior design of the hotel and the pool area with the double sunbeds and canopied sunbeds was great. Although quite isolated there is a shuttle bus twice a day and they are very accommodating about timing. But a taxi into Mykonos town was only 20euros.",1
"The hotel had been recently refurbished. It was beautiful. Our room for three overlooked the bay so the view was stunning. The pool clean and great beds and loungers around it. We had bed and breakfast and I can only say the food was delicious. Fresh cake, pastries, wonderful Greek yoghurt and various jams, eggs, bacon and freshly baked bread. Ate at the restaurant a couple of times - chef brilliant and catered for my friend who is allergic to garlic!! The staff made the holiday - they couldn't do enough for us middle aged ladies out for a laugh! Quad bike hire a lot of fun too. Only downside is that Mykanos itself is very pricey but I would not hesitate to recommend. The hotel.   Room Tip: Right at front lovely view of bay See more room tips",0
"A beautiful hotel with amazing views. Will definitely come back. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. A very clean and well run establishment,with excellent food.The staff are first class, so helpful and welcoming.The hotel also comes equipped with a shuttle service which takes you into the town daily. All in all a brilliant service at no extra cost.Fantastic!!!   Room Tip: Rooms have a breath taking sea view with a balcony, See more room tips",0
"Again on Mykonos after a long time of absence felt like I'd never been here before. We arrived at the hotel on its opening day for this year, the 28th April 2016 and were pleasantly astonished by the way everything was working like a well-wound clock. Location, accommodation and view, all amazing. Ten-minutes drive from the joyful busy Yalos, down town and the rest world famous Myconian beaches and party places. Serene cycladic atmosphere around the pool, paradise blue sea water, Kalo Livadi beach, at a walking distance. Friendly, polite staff always focusing on making your stay an unforgettable experience, coordinated by, with the grace and elegance of a music orchestra conductor, the owner, Tonia Panagopoulou. Excellent hotel services justifying the gold prize they have been awarded only recently in 2016. Inspired fusion cuisine based on the finest greek ingredients, splashes flavors of joy and enables one upgrade the ability of taste. Additionally, gym and spa services help one ease the mind further and practice the ancient saying 'Íïõò õãéÞò åí óþìáôé õãéåß' in other words...'healthy mind in a healthy body'.I feel I could keep writing about this splendid hotel experience for ever....Last but not least, I wish to express my sincere thanks to all and promise to be back really soon....In the meanwhile, I fully recommend this hotel to those who get satisfied with only the best....",2
"This review comes in a little late, as I stayed at the property in September 2015. It is a fine, small, family-run hotel. I am sure some would call it a boutique hotel, but I actually think of it more as an “inn”. The owners and staff were friendly and helpful. The common areas are nice, the gardens are pretty, but I did not care for the pool at all. As anywhere in Mykonos, it is extremely windy, but there are other issues… The decks felt too small, and there were not enough loungers. As the area is shaded and the pool is surprisingly deep at one end, that combination meant uncomfortably cold water (mostly getting out of the pool, because of the wind). Our standard room was small, mostly taken by the bed (which was large and comfortable), very limited storage, and the bathroom was the tiniest in recent memory. Our friends were upgraded to a larger room, with a spacious bathroom, a sitting area… nicer. Both rooms had that typically “Greek” look’n’feel – meaning uneven white walls, white furnishings, blue and white fabrics… Fine, yet unremarkable. Despite tiny, our room was on the lowest “tier”, right above the parking lot, and I preferred it as it meant a sweeping view of Kalo Livadi – better than our friends’, which had no view at all – and a lot more privacy, as only staff and the few guests staying in the adjacent rooms seemed to go down there. That was important, as it featured an outdoor terrace. Given the hotel size, the gym is surprisingly well-equipped – albeit a bit cramped, as (again) it is small. It opened very late, but they were kind enough to provide me with the pin code so that I could use it as early as I wanted, before breakfast. Speaking of which, was good, overall… the coffee itself was not wonderful and I found the assortment of breads and pastries somewhat poor, but they certainly served scrumptious fruit-and-herb jams, and the fresh fruit selection was the best I had in Greece. The in-house restaurant is reputed as one of the finest on the island, but as we were driving around all day and sometimes until late at night, we invariably ended up eating elsewhere. We had rented a car, so Archipelagos' relatively remote location was not a problem at all. Mykonos is easy to navigate; Kalo Livadi is a 20-minute drive away from Chora, for instance. Yet, other guests who had not rented a car were somewhat “stranded” there, as we overheard their talking. All in all, the property met, but did not exceed, our expectations. Recommended if combined to a car rental, as, for us, the property would not be a destination in itself.",0
Love love love this hotel!!!<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>Location is strategic and bit further from town but quiet and peaceful ..breakfast was delicious and fall in love with the fluffy greek yogurt in the hotel.we ordered the room service and it was delicious!!the room was nice decorated and our view was facing the sea and it just amazing woke up in the morning with the view!!!overall this hotel was superb!!!,0
"I would not have even created an account to review the other hotels I stayed. I simple had to tell everyone what an amazing place this was. Especially the staff and owners made us feel at home. We stayed one week and we only went out once as we really had a great time at the hotel. We had dinner a la carte and every day. Giannis (the chef) had something special to propose to us. Fresh fish, mussels and vegetables from Mykonos. We enjoyed refreshing cocktails from the pool bar and everyone was very friendly and polite. The location was fantastic. Very quiet and picturesque. Our Mykonian style room was clean & comfortable with great sea view balcony.We'll definitely stay at Archipelagos again the next time we visit Mykonos!",1
"The perfect place for total relaxation and luxury.Staff were amazing, nothing is too much trouble,friendly and welcoming.The rooms are really lovely with magnificent views from the generous sized balcony.Bedding good quality, towels soft and fluffy both in rooms and freely available by the pool. All communal facilities are excellent and all good quality.Plenty of choice of good quality locally sourced foods at breakfast.Dinner was an event in itself. The presentation on the plates was excellent and choice and taste superb. Compliments to the Chef.Only negative is that the hotel is situated away from it all,nearest shop 15 mins by car. Having said that it is just perfect for peace and quiet and unwinding.   Room Tip: All rooms have large balconies and lovely views. See more room tips",0
"We travelled through Greece and some of the islands for 2 weeks and this place was head and shoulders above the rest.Highest marks for decor, setting and quality of the rooms and the food was simply superb.It is on the far side of Mykonos away from the old town so is quieter but has a splendid view over the bay and an excellent beach a short walk away.",0
"My Wife and I stayed here for the first 10 days of October. Room, facilities and pool plus superb restaurant makes this a special place. The disappointing thing for us was Mykonos itself. Over run with cruise ship visitors and its lovely beaches buried under a swathe of sun beds. The island lacks the natural Greek charm and is very expensive by comparison. I had failed to do my homework for our type of preferences but clearly it suits a lot of people.Whatever, if you stay at Archipelagos you are assured of beautiful sea views, superb cuisine and spacious comfortable rooms. It's a long walk to the nearest village and supermarket at Ano Mera but there is a bus",1
"We visited in August 2015 for 5 days. Everything about the hotel was fantastic.RECEPTIONOur welcome was very warm from the receptionist and her manager. We were offered fresh house lemonade while enjoying the view to the bay. They gave us useful information about Mykonos and tips about places to visit, beaches and restaurants. During our stay they were very helpful, polite and always willing to help.ROOMSBright, modern, stylish and with great view to the ocean. Soft towels and bathrobes and Apivita bathroom amenities.RESTAURANTVery nice dishes with Greek products. We had often fresh fish which was delicious and we loved the yogurt millefeuille. The chef was ready to prepare special dishes when we asked for. The staff are always with a smile and are willing to help you anytime.BEACHKalo Livadi is one of the best beaches in Mykonos.I really can't say enough good things about Archipelagos. If you're visiting Mykonos, you should stay here.",1
"I decided to take my mum on a four night last minute getaway and this beautiful hotel did not let us down. The views from the hotel are stunning, laying by the pool is incredibly relaxing with back drop of the beautiful shore line . The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and spent time chatting and getting to know the guests .The shuttle bus is set at twice a day 12pm or 9pm however the 9pm we felt was toolate .The food in the restaurant was very good and Al La Carte menu is extensive for such a small hotel. Our hotel room was very clean and we had beautiful views . The only disappointment was not having a kettle in the room. We will definitely revisit this hotel and would recommend this beautiful hotel as a truly lovely Grecian getaway . stunning , the",1
"We had an amazing experience at this hotel. The place was exactly what I was looking. Quiet, breathtaking views from our room. Clean and comfort rooms. All the staff are so very nice to all guests. The reception staff are very polite, will book you restaurants, advice where to go etc. The restaurant staff are always with a smile ready to serve all your needs. The chef made the best creative ideas and we had great meals. There is also a spa with a massage service and a small gym which we did not use on this visit. I've given the hotel 5 stars because it deserves it",1
"It is a lovely hotel, beautifully clean, lovely gardens with many colours of hibiscus flowers and blooming boucamvilles.The restaurant and bar were superb, the pool was really nice with modern furniture and relaxing ambience. The room was comfortable and clean and the location was ideal (out of the way from busy and noisy Myconos town but only 15 minutes away if you want to party). The service was excellent. It was simply an amazing stay! We will return soon!!",1
"Archipelagos hotel is just simply chic, stylish and gorgeous. Perfect for a stylish getaway with friends or young families. Aim to get a sea view room as the views are stunning. The grounds are clean and well kept, lovely plants and gleaming white walls, (perfect for pictures). Views from every direction are gorgeous as the hotel sits sort of staggered on a hill looking out to the sea. Keep in mind it is very windy in mykonos (40-50mph) so bring a cardigan with you for the evening dinners at the hotel. The restaurant has huge glass windows which they leave open in the evenings, as the restaurant has no air conditioning (and it is not needed). It is a lovely restaurant, overlooking the pool and sea and has a relaxed classy atmosphere. With simple decor and candles. The waiters are amazing. George in particular had the best personality, always with a smile, a joke, asking how our day went and accommodated our picky eating habits without even batting an eye (and we were very irritating). He even arranged a cheese toastie at minutes to 11pm at night when the restaurant had closed but we were starving.The rooms are simple and clean, decorated in white linens and furniture with all the necessary amenities. Our beds were very comfortable. And the air conditioning was easy to use. The only downside to the room amenities is no iron was provided and you had to pay extra euros per item to have them ironed or laundered. The staff at Archipelagos hotel are very friendly and helpful. They are young and focused anticipating your needs before you do. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. One staff member even offered me a jacket from her own personal clothes one evening as I was cold. They are full of advice on where to go and how to get there. We were after clubbing and cool beaches.There is Solymar beach bar just 3 minutes down hill from the hotel, if you ever feel like leaving. A lovely beach with a music filled bar with decent but over priced food.The location of Archipelagos is good, it takes about 20 mins in a taxi to Mykonos town and little venice where all the restaurants, shops and bars are located, we would pay 20Euro at a time. A little longer on a scooter, but the taxi drivers go quite fast and you dont really notice it is a little way away. Mykonos in the center however is heaving with people and it is nice to be able to get away and go to your peaceful hotel. All in all, Archipelagos Hotel is worth the stay and the money. It is a great location and has amazing grounds. Guaranteed a relaxing trip. You could easily spend the whole day at the hotel laid out by the pool.   Room Tip: Request sea view room when booking. Bring an iron. See more room tips",0
"Regrettably we didn't stay at this hotel but at an apartment near it, despite this the staff could not have done more to help us and arrange everything we needed. The restaurant is really lovely with some great dishes and again fab service.The pool area looked so calm and relaxing.We'll be staying here if we go back to Mykonos",2
"Archipelagos is wonderful. The staff is friendly, the rooms are fantastic and they just make everything easy. Beautiful gardens with herbs and flowers. The team is exceptional, warm and friendly. Great chef and the breakfast is really good. We have booked the half board and the food was delicious with many Greek tastes. Transport to and from the port/airport was easy and convenient. Will be back again on our next visit :)",2
"This was the BEST hotel/holiday experience ever. My husband and I stayed here for a week this past summer and absolutely loved it. First of all, Mykonos is the perfect balance of beautiful views, tons of beaches ranging from tranquil to trendsetter/chic to party beaches, great fresh local cuisine at amazing restaurants, and fun nightlife/lounges/clubs. On top of it all, Archipelagos Hotel in Kalo Livadi was the perfect place to stay. Best of all were the owners and the staff, many of whom we got to know, and who were very friendly and made us feel at home. They also gave us great recommendations on places to go in Mykonos. On one evening, to celebrate a special occasion for us, the chef created a delicious 5-course meal based on local ingredients. We also enjoyed the beautiful views of the sea while relaxing at the pool bar many days, and also got great relaxing massages at the hotel spa. The hotel is only a five minute walk from some good beach clubs - Solymar and Monarch - where you can go for sunbathing, drinks and cool music. Also, we wanted to rent a car for a couple of days, so the hotel organized the rental car company to drop off and pick up the car directly from our hotel - very easy. We have been to many different destinations for summer holidays, including Bora Bora, South of France, Ibiza, etc., but we enjoyed Mykonos the most BY FAR. We were sad to leave. We are already excited to return to Archipelagos Hotel next summer and to make Mykonos a regular holiday destination!",2
"Fabulous hotel, lovely staff and food. Room clean and bright. Clean towels every day! Bit remote so need car or bus into town but easy to doSome of sun loungers could do with some cushions and variation of menu for evening meals would be good but food excellent!Beaches are wonderful and cost about 10 euros each, some were 30 euros for two but good service. Views amazing and sunset at Mykonos town worth seeing! Would go back!   Room Tip: always ask for sea view room, views amazing See more room tips",1
Simply perfect! Location 9Service 10Food 9Room 9Clean10Simply perfect if you re looking for something out of the movida. 15 min far from downtown.Quite with great see view. 15 min far from Paradise and other locations.,0
"Hotel is approx.10 km from Mykonos city near Kalo livadi beach (one of the best in Mykonos!). It has an amazing view of the bay and the sea. Beautiful rooms in traditional greek modern style, beautiful terrace with an amazing swimming pool. Breakfast in this hotel was perfect with many local products and delicious homemade jams and pies!All the members of the team made us feel special. The food was excellent at the restaurant of the Hotel with really good prices compared to the rest of Mykonos popular spots. I would highly recommend it to everyone. I spent 5 days in this hotel with my wife, for sure I will go again in the future. Thank you Archipelagos!",0
"We travel a lot and we have seen all kind of hotels, but this hotel is really EXCELLENT!!! Lovely room, yes they are not luxurious but who need that with this big balcony, nice garden and the view to Kalo Livadi bay. The pool area is well designed and comfort. Breakfasts excellent with many different choices. Everything looks like the hotel was open this year but it is not. Great staff, that made us feel at home. Thank you!",1
"We had 7 nights here and the hotel was just amazing! Lovely room, and my wife just loved our balcony and the view to Kalo Livadi bay. The pool area is well designed to ensure maximum comfort. Breakfasts excellent with many different choices and good product quality. We ate here one evening, from the a la carte menu, and the food was very good. We wish we had dinner at Archipelagos more often as all restaurants in Mykonos are quite expensive and not good value for money. Great staff, polite and efficient that made us feel at home. Would go back anytime and will always recommend Arhipelagos hotel!",2
"Like Tripadvisor usually says to me-I want to tell you about my terrific experience in Archipelagos Hotel.We picked this hotel because it looked like one of the Santorin’s hotel on the caldera and we made a very good choice. Each room has a private terrace that looks towards the sea. Not all the rooms have the sea view, because some of them are obstructed by the other buildings situated in front of them.We were expected at the airport by our driver. This was booked in advance by our travel agent, but the transfer can be done by the hotel, too. When I saw the narrow streets of Mykonos and the fact that almost nobody was wearing a helmet when riding the ATV or the motor bike, and they were riding in a very chaotic manner I decided that I do not want to rent a car. It was much too dangerous for me, so I depended on local transport means -bus and taxi. We arrive to the reception late in the afternoon and we were welcomed by the receptionists with a big smile. He gave us a map o Mykonos, he explained about the hotel and the means of transport and he offered us from the bar a very welcomed refreshing lemonade. Then the driver of the shuttle bus took our luggage to our wonderful room. I did not see the other rooms, but for me this one was the best. On the terrace we had rose flowers that made a vault. The room was spacious, with a wardrobe, safe and mini-bar. We had bathrobes and slippers. The bathroom was spacious, too and we had a bath tub. There were a lot of toiletries products and the towels were hanged on a nice ladder. Everything was decorated in good taste, with blue and white. Our room was situated at 4th floor and we had a sea view. The room was cleaned on daily basis- towels changed each time we wanted and the linen was changed every other 2 days. Even though after coming from the beach in the afternoon it seemed like the linen was changed every day. It smelled so good when entering in the room. The basket from our room was emptied also during the evening. The period we stayed at the hotel was not windy (luckily), but we had mosquitoes. The hotel provides you the device and the pills you need to get rid of them. The wi-fi works very well and is fast.We were on half-board base and we made a very good choice this time, too.The breakfast started at 8.30 and could last until 11.00. Each morning we had the breakfast on the terrace having the chance to catch a glance of the sea each morning. The bread all the other products were very fresh and tasty. We had ham, cheese, eggs, jams, juices, sweets, coffee and tea. You could make your own tea, by mixing different flavors available. There was a special corner where you could find different type of local cakes.In the evening - starting at 19.00-until 20.30- we had a meal of courses- an appetizer, a salad, the main course and the desert. For the main course there were 2 choices. Everything we ate was so good and fresh and the chef made each dish look very appealing. I truly recommend the half board for this hotel. I do not think that elsewhere on the island you can eat better than here. During dinner time we drank only local beer that was brought in glasses kept in the refrigerator, having the ice on.The two waiters were very nice they made our dinner experience much nicer by interacting with us responding to our jokes. They make a good team together with the girl from the bar. The hotel has a lot of palm trees, and green spots with many flowers and the white of the buildings makes a wonderful mixture. It also has a pool, a nice one- good size. We only use it once and it was a good experience. I saw that some of the hotel guests decided to spend their time only by the pool because we could see them in the morning, late afternoon and also we can saw their towels- keeping the seat reserved forever. We went to the beach only on Kalo Livadi bay. The sand was so soft and the water was crystal clear, no waves and very warm. As I told you before there was almost no wind during our stay so we did not use any of the beach beds from Solymar and Monarch. We did not here either so I do not know the prices. I saw that each of the restaurants has certain fences to protect from the wind. I am sure that you cannot sit on the beach like we did, if the wind is blowing. In our book the sea and the beach in Kalo LIvadi are on top.The bus that goes from Kalafatis to Mykonos is situated right up to the hill from the hotel, at the cross roads, where is the sign to the supermarket (the only supermarket that is close to the hotel- 10 minutes walking). Is a small super market but you can find some basic staff.The bus does not run very often but is always on time. We did not have to wait for him to come. One way ticket was 2,30 Euros to Mykonos town and it can be bought directly from the driver.The shuttle bus of the hotel runs 2 times per day- one at 12.00 and the other one at 21.00. We used the shuttle bus at 21.00 and come back with the taxi. The taxi station in Mykonos is right at the entrance of Mykonos, is where the shuttle bus will have the final stop. We had to wait for a queue for almost 30 minutes. So, it is true there are not many taxis on the island. In plus the driver was asking everybody from the queue which direction they want to go and the picked persons from the queue that were behind us. It was kind of strange. The ride back to the hotel was 20 Euro. Even if this hotel is a little remote it can offer a very nice holiday providing high quality services. Also the big plus is the wonderful Kalo Livadi bay that is one of the best from the Island. Except for visiting Mykonos 3 times we did not do much except that lying in the sun and swimming.I would like to thank to the whole team of Archipelagos hotel for everything they did for us!",0
"First of all, hotel stuff is very friendly.. Nice welcome. Yannis in charge of cuisine is very good. I can not forget his strawberry jam with melisa.. Our room was big with living room area and a big terrace with a view of Kalo Livadi. Bathroom is very clean with Apivita products. City is 20 minutes car ride.. You must rent a car in Mykonos. We discovered 8 beaches in the island. Near hotel.. Monarch is one of the best beach club with a good restaurant.. Sea is unforgettable in Mykonos. Paraga is very nice beach.. Kahlua recommended for swim...Scorpio is the best sunset club.. Jackie O black perfect lunch.. Nammos for a dinner.. Not a nice beach during the day.. Very crowded and small..",0
"I was so excited about staying in this hotel after reading all the rave reviews! Someone had even said it was the best hotel they had stayed in in 40 years. It was a nice hotel but for me nothing outstanding. Rooms are perfectly adequate but not luxurious in my opinion. Mykonos itself was far more expensive than I had anticipated the restaurants down on the beach near the hotel are ridiculously priced! We had one drink and never went back! They also play music 24/7 which gets annoying! The hotel is about 20mins out of Mykonos town but there are fairly regularly buses which are cheap at 2 euros last one back is around 8/8.30 though. Buses were always on time! I loved the pool area in the hotel, the breakfast was really nice and always plenty of food. I also liked the food in the restaurant but again I found it quite expensive. Staff all very friendly and helpful. This was actually our honeymoon trip but it didn't feel like a honeymoon the hotel didn't acknowledge it at all (they knew it was our honeymoon) and I felt that was a little poor. So much so that I have arranged another trip over our year anniversary which will now be our proper honeymoon too. All in all its a nice hotel, not outstanding and lacking something.",0
Well the hotel as everything on the island is expensive...the rooms are small with nice views.... The personnel polite... The breakfast moderate... Please do not think that by adding flavors to a local produce makes it gourmet .... The jam of pear with basil is bad...leave the taste genuine.... The gym is small but adequate as the spa... Pool area small but nice....generally it is a good hotel but member of the SLHW ??????,0
"We loved this hotel. It was just perfect for our short holidays. Our room had beautiful design, very comfortable beds and attention to detail. We have appreciated the professionalism of all the staff : smiling, pleasant. Congratulations to all!We will definitely be back and we will recommend Archipelagos.",1
"I don’t normally write reviews BUT felt we really had to with this hotel.We stayed here for one week at the beginning of July but wished it was longer! This hotel is truly beautiful and we could not fault it. Rooms: What an amazing view from our balcony absolutely stunning (will post a pic). Very clean and well maintained. Safe deposit box was big enough to store all valuables. Bathroom was clean with fresh towels.Meals: The chef is AMAZING. The food is fabulous. We have a daughter who is a fussy eater! The chef came out to speak with us and asked what she liked and didn’t like and said to just say if there was anything she wanted/didn’t want or changed from the menu! We couldn’t ask for more and this really put our minds to rest. The food and presentation was excellent. The burger is simply delicious as was every meal we had there, and the lava cake delicious.Location: Yes it is quiet and slightly remote BUT that is what gives it such amazing and beautiful views. I would suggest you hire a car to enjoy the beautiful island and try out the many beaches all of which have cushioned sun loungers and a beach waitress service (our favourite was Elia, which is 5 minutes by car). A trip into the town is a must for panoramic views and amazing restaurants. Again by car it takes around 20 minutes to drive to the town. When we arrived we realised it would be a good idea to hire a car, we spoke to reception who arranged everything for us. No problems at all.Pool: The days we stayed around the pool were very relaxing and it is lovely. I have read other reviews saying the pool is too small but we would disagree as it is a small boutique hotel, therefore it is the perfect size. It was never too busy it was just right.Staff: The staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble. They were always very welcoming, happy and very helpful.We LOVED this hotel… we have and will continue to recommended it to friends and family and we will definitely return. A massive THANK YOU to the Archipelagos Hotel and team for making our holiday such a fantastic and memorable time.   Room Tip: Before you travel, it is worth emailing to ask if you can have a full sea view room. The best views... See more room tips",2
"We stayed at archipielagos hotel for twi days. Atad was very nice, always helping. Bedroom was beatiful and comfortable. Wifi works really well and breakfast was very good taste. The beach was close to the hotel and it was one of the best in mykonos.For me the only bad thing for this hotel was that it was far to mykonos city, the place was too quite for us, just tree restaurants in the beach, very expensives",0
"Archipelagos is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. From the moment you arrive, the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. The whole hotel is gorgeouly decorated - the pool area at night is really special. Views across Kalo Lavadi are awesome. The breakfast is delicious, as is all the other food on the menu. You can easily walk down to Kalo Lavadi for dinner - there are 3 restaurants, 2 are very expensive, but the Italian in the middle is really delicious. The hotel offers a free transfer to Mykonos town at 12pm and 9pm if you book in advance. Alternatively there is a bus for 2 euros about 7 times throughout the day (last one back from Mykonos town is midnight) or a taxi costs 20 euros each way. Top tip - spend at least one night in the nearby town of Ano Mera (on the bus route or the hotel transfer can drop you on its way to Mykonos). There's an atmospheric little square with a selection of traditional and excellent value restaurants - the best food we had on the island.",3
"Great Location to the East of the Island walking distance from the Kala Lavadi main beach.Approx. 20mins by Taxi into Mykonos Town (€25-30 Charge), Bus 25/30mins (€2 Charge)YesLocation perfect if you want to chill. Also only 100 metres from a large and well provided ( seat hire, service and restaurants) beach. Only 3 restaurants/bars.Brilliant staffBreakfast - very good spread (Hotel - self egg boiler would be a good addition )Hotel Restaurant is also very good, certainly better than anything on the beach, Ioannis Chatziandreou the Chef and his staff are stars, worth getting to know. Very creative.Hotel very well designed and equipped Beautiful bedrooms overlooking the bay, with lovely solid bathrooms (despite being a shower in the bath agh lol) Pool area - lovely pool, with plenty of sitting, although we were here during a very windy week, and half the spots by the pool are pretty exposed (wind see below)Gym very well equipped for this size hotelGood hotel clientele, nice mix of international people, couples, familiesSpa - very low key, had Sauna and Massage facilities (€85 for a 50 min Swedish, seemed a tad expensive )Wind - Mykonos is know as a very windy island, the week we were here the wind was so strong as to make using the local beach unattractive (sand being blown around), this is a general risk of Mykonos not this Hotel.Tips Small Beach located down the hill, left away from the main beach is a great place for a quick good sea swim near the hotel. Perfect if you like open swimming Bus service into and out of town very easy to use (also goes past Ano Mera), every 1 -2 hours, last one back from Town at 12pm.Ano Mera worth visiting, plenty of restaurants and a good vibe on the main square (40 mins walk, hotel cab drop, taxi or bus)Tips for HotelMore pool towels. Towels seemed a bit of a pinch point. Pool bar staff move out from behind the bar, be more interactive with punters, take orders, sell up, pick up empties. It's a win win for Hotel and guests. Open Gym earlier, 9am is way too lateProper Loungers on the Bedroom verandas would be a nice touch, so you could chill away from the pool area",2
"My husband and I stayed here for a week in June.It is a lovely hotel, beautifully clean, lovely gardens and great rooms.The breakfast was ok although pretty much the same every day, the lunches were very good, great value and fab service. We really enjoyed the cool music that was played round the pool too! Wifi for was excellent too.The views are absolutely amazing, pure bliss. The hotel is located down a very steep hill so I would say to hire a car, especially is you struggle a bit with mobility. The hotel help,out where they can with a lift in the hotel bus, and there are public buses you can use to get around beautiful Mykonos.The only negative for us was you could smell cigarette smoke in the breakfast room sometimes, we worked out it was coming from the office that is just off the dining room, not pleasant first thing in the morning or anytime for that matter!Apart from that, we would definitely return to this hotel.",1
"For sure is one of the best hotel i ever stay with my family.Perfect view, the stuff arevery kind, good food, very clean rooms.In a very beautiful place in mykonos, in kalolivadi.Also my kids like bery much the swimming pool",0
"My kids, wife and i had a very nice time in Archipelagos hotel. The hotel is a lovely hide away from noisy and busy Mykonos town. The place perched on a cliff overlooking a beautiful harbor. Both our rooms were quiet and had a fantastic view on the sea. Staff and the owner are extremely helpful and truly enjoy contacts with their clients. It is never too much to ask. We really appreciated the tips re best beaches and local restaurants provided by Anya (a Russian born waitress living in Mykonos for years). The chief can prepare dishes of your choice. The food is sophisticated, delicious and reasonably priced. The restaurant terrace is very nice too.Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and look forward to coming back.",3
"The Archipelagos Hotel lived up to its reputation and provided us with a most relaxing 14 night break. My wife was recovering from an operation so we were looking for a chilled, quality environment with great views, food and service which the hotel delivered without fail.This was our first time in Mykonos and we rarely repeat visit however we have fallen for the island big time and it ticks all the boxes for us in terms of quality, design, food, beaches, sea, bars as well as the vibe and the amazing light! The beach clubs were really good and a special mention must go to Monarch which opened in May had the comfiest sunbeds ranging from 20 to 40 Euros for two. You even have a buzzer to call for bar or food service! Also don't miss the small beach near to the hotel (5 mins) ... super clear water and ideal for snorkelling.Only one slight suggestion for the hotel... introduce a happy hour late afternoon/early evening ... will help guests congregate and get to know each other a little better! Guests were from all over the world USA, Australia, Switz, Austria, France etc.It is quite a low key glamorous spot and we did have a Film/TV actor and his Strictly Come dancing UK wife staying at the hotel same time as us and footballer Cisse did a DJ set at the beach and Tamara Ecclestone was with her family at Solymar Beach club :)   Room Tip: We had room 213 ... outstanding views See more room tips",0
Hotel is a little far out but if you plan your day there are convenient facilities to get to town in 15min . The hotel itself is beautiful and comfortable. The restaurant had great food and pool side service was good to for drinks and small meals . The staff of all levels are amazingly attentive and friendly. The view is amazing and you within walking distance of a beautiful beach as well. I had nothing to fault.,0
"This hotel is very pretty & clean.well kept gardens and comfortable rooms. Nice bathrooms and the best breakfasts ever !The staff are really lovely & friendly and are happy to give advice about the area and places to go.Bad points: the pool is small Def not big enough to swim and the hotel is a too far away from town. The public transport was non existing and taxis cost us €20 each way every night. there is a courtesy bus but only twice a day at 12 noon & 9pm! Odd times.The solomar beach club is good, nice comfy beds and good music .I would definitely not take small children to this hotel There's no shallow pool and it's pretty dangerous for toddlers. An adult only hotel I'd say.Nice holiday but I wouldn't stay here again I'm afraid.",0
"It's a very nice place. Great views, 5 minutes to Kalo Livadi beach. Staff is very nice. Restraunt is great, plating and taste are unbelivible. The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because of the remote location. If you don't have a rental car and plan to go to places on the island then find a different hotel. There is a big problem getting a taxi in Mykonos. I would strongly advise to make airport/port transportation arrengments with the hotel before you arrive. Hotel has a shuttle service to town only twice a day( I think noon and 9 pm). The only way to get back to hotel is by taking a public transportation and the last one leaves at midnite. Again to taxis available.So you have pretty much only 3 hours to spent in the city, it's defenately not enough if you're planning on having a dinner or want to ""enjoy"" the night life. There is a 10 min. downhill walk from the bus stop to the hotel, it's peach black and we were lucky that I had my cell phone with me and used the flushlight. If you want to be off the grid then this is the hotel I'll recommend (or better yet Naxos or Paros islands,much cheaper, friendlier people and less wind), if you want active vacation (without rental car/scooter) than choose a hotel close to the city. I think the hotel should provide better transportaton options.",0
Amazing place and view ! Amazing staff ! definitely a must if visiting Mykonos. Near an amazing beach suitable for all ages. About 20minutes away from the centre. Though a much better place for relaxing and a great time. Recommended for everyone,0
"We visited Mykonos the first week of July. Mykonos is a beatiful island with very nice beaches. We had very good recommendations from the reception staff about restaurants and beaches on the island. They made all the arrangements for us. Our room was comfortable, with nice decoration (white and blue colors), very clean and we had a large terrace with view of Kalo Livadi bay. The food and the ambience of Archipelagos restaurant was fantastic! We had dinner several times. The beef fillet with fresh truffle was the best beef fillet I have ever had! The burger was very tasty and juicy! I would highly recommend Archipelagos and we hope to visit Mykonos and Archipelagos very soon!",0
"Archipelagos had everything we dreamed of! Amazing views, nice and cozy rooms, great food and breakfast, friendly staff. Kalo Livadi is one of the best beaches on the island. We liked the fact that we stayed in a more quite and peaceful area. Mykonos town and the beaches near Mykonos town are very crowded and too noisy! You can visit Chora in 15 min by car. Local buses run frequently to town (there is usually a bus every hour) and the hotel offers shuttle service as well. A big thank you to Archipelagos team who made our holidays perfect. We will definitely come back!",0
"Stayed here first 6 days of July with my husband. We are seasoned travellers in our 30's and stay in 4/5 star hotels worldwide.HOTEL - worthy of a 4* rating, fresh decor, modern bathroom, breakfast area with great view and a very tasty breakfast. Pool area and everywhere very windy. Pool bar expensive - hotel should consider happy hour as hardly anyone bought anything.We had very noisy people below us resulting in ringing reception at midnight to complain. Not good. Another complaint is the fact the hotel charge 12euro pp for the 10/15 min transfer to/from the airport each way. This is a rip off. To the hotel there were 8 of us meaning the hotel made a profit of 96euro for that one short trip. This service should be at least half the price. LOCATION - This is the major letdown. Although a picturesque setting, there is nothing nearby, no shop, or bars within walking distance other than the 3 restaurants on the beach which were very expensive and empty. The main beach is lovely but the constant wind means that unless you get a sunbed at 20euro each for the day you can not sit on the sand as it just blows in your face. There is a small beach around the bay 5 min walk which is quiet and less windy. OVERALL - you need a car or scooter if staying here otherwise too isolated. Prices all over Mykonos very expensive and beaches all packed with overpriced sunbeds. Hotel was nice but would not stay here again. TIP head to one of the less popular islands such as Paros on the ferry which are much nicer, less crowded and better value.",0
"This was the second time Phill and I stayed in this hotel as loved it so much when we stayed last September! It was my Birthday 3 days into the 5 night break and the plan was to have fun and party a little before heading off to Santorini for 5 nights.They made my Birthday very special, we booked the Jacuzzi / steam room for an hour which was beautifully decorated for us followed with massages.The pool area is quant and nice and quiet in the day, perfect for chilling out and the food is divine! From the lunch time menu to the dinner menu, there is a lovely selection of food, the chefs come out to chat about the food and are passionate about it, breakfast is different but very nice and our glasses were never left empty!The rooms are white and bright and spacious and our bathroom was decorated to taste with a window overlooking the Argean sea - it's beautiful and made our day waking up to it every morning.Tonia, Kostas and all of the hotel staff are lovely friendly people and can't do enough for you! They are great company when we stay, especially our friend Kostas!I would highly recommend staying here, it is out of the way from town and the hustle and bustle, by one of the best beaches. I would suggest hiring a car or getting cabs and trying / dining out at Cavo Tagoo / Bill & Coo / Nammos Beach / Kuzina on Ornos Beach and definitely try a day / evening of partying on Paradise Beach, it was so much fun! The town / little Venice is beautiful too - take a walk around the winding back alleys / streets and try a cocktail in Queens.   Room Tip: All rooms are sea view so you can't go wrong! See more room tips",0
"Stayed here for 3 nights last week and felt fully refreshed when I left. The hotel is set up a hill, but only a 5 min walk to Kalo Livadi beach. My room (122) has only one neighbour next door and fantastic views over the Aegean sea to the front and a great view of the pool/restaurant to the back. The bed was very comfortable and there was a small 'living' room with a day bed and a mini bar, and then a lovely balcony which also had a day bed as well as a table and two chairs. When Roland picked me up from the airport he gave all the info I needed, including the times he was going to and from the hotel to the nearest village (Ano Mera) and into Mykonos Town, if I ever needed a lift. Check in was fast and I felt very welcome. I was also given the timetable for the buses to and from Mykonos Town, which stopped just at the top of the hill (the journey's approx. 15 mins). The hotel is spotless; the staff helpful, friendly and professional. The food (I had breakfast every day and tried a couple of things from the lunch/dinner menu also) is fresh, plentiful and delicious. I had a treatment at the spa which I was happy with, although I did find it very expensive. If there was one thing that I could add to make my stay any better it would have been a coffee machine in my room. There is not much there for children but if you want a relaxing, first class hotel away from everything, pick this one! I will definitely return.",0
"Beautiful ! What can I say .. It was perfect the first time we stayed now it's just amazing , thank you Tonia and Kostas for such a lovely warm welcome it was hard to leave again. The food was fantastic , rooms are superb and staff are so professional and helpful, wish we could have stayed longer. Can't recommend this hotel highly enough and next time I will find time to use the spa !! See you again soon x   Room Tip: Sea view across Kalo Livadi beach with balcony See more room tips",0
"We stayed here as a family last week and had a fabulously relaxing time. The hotel is exceptionally well run, with the friendliest of staff. Breakfast was divine with every taste well catered for. My favourite lunch dish was the Feta with watermelon salad....simply delicious. A bonus of the dining area was that the chef pops out to engage with the guests. The rooms are well appointed with very comfortable beds. The pool was lovely, especially on a hot day, with plenty of space for a swim. We all had spa treatments, a package was created for us, and these were professionally delivered using quality products. All in all, a perfect chilled week. Thank you Archipelagos!",0
"It is a small boutique hotel, very beautiful and unique. Nice location near to the center of the city and the restaurants (3 minutes walking) the people are very friendly and the concierge is lovely they dont say NO to anything!The FOOD IS GREAT!!!!!!Lovely boutique hotel and nice swimming pool!",0
"This hotel has an amazing location. If you wish to take the bus to the beaches, the station is up the block. Cab services and scooter rentals are also a few feet away. The staff is okay, nothing like in Santorini, but the hotel and its amenities are great! Breakfast is very good with lots of options and ample seating. The drinks and lunch at the hotel are superb. The back exit gives you direct access to Mykonos' Town bars, ,Lounges and restaurants!This is my favorite hotel in Mykonos!!! Highly recommend this hotel!!! Mykonos is a great island! Super friendly and there is great transportation to beaches everywhere!!! Great parties and amazing Greek people !!",1
"This hotel is one so unique the staff are extremely helpful and friendly, you feel like you are at home.It is in town 5min walking distance you wont need a car in the evening, and during the day it's located on the main road so easy to get a taxi to go to the beach.The bike rental place and bus stop is less than 5 min walk as wellI recommend this hotel, check the hotel site direct for the best value when booking.",0
"We had a great stay at Semeli. Great location, good varied breakfast. Pool is small and you need to be quick for sunbeds. Room is well appointed and the beds are comfortable. We had a great view from our terrace and could see the Harbour. Sunset is in front of you. Car Parking available though big slope down to it- get them to bring your car back up unless your good at clutch control!",1
"I stayed at the Semeli Hotel for five nights in May 2016 and was impressed with the impeccable service and great location. Though our room was one of the less ideal ones - below the level of the ground in a way - it was still very good nevertheless. The food was pretty good, too. Recommend!",0
"It was my first trip to Mykonos and I couldn't fault my experience with Semeli. The breakfast was good, the pool was beautiful, not too busy, spacious rooms, comfortable beds and good wifi. Right in Mykonos town which is perfect because it's such a beautiful town- you wouldn't want to be anywhere else!",0
"It's a nice hotel fully recommended for those who would like to stay in the city. Rooms are clean with all amenities, swimming pool and surrounding area, really nice for an hotel in the center of the city. In walking distance we can walk the famous venezia or matoyania and to visit some of the best restaurants and bars of the city. Breakfast is excellent and the same the bar and restaurant in the swimming pool.   Room Tip: Upper floor, sa view See more room tips",2
"Nothing is too hard for the Semeli staff. We got a flat tire on the other side of the island at about 9pm and our rental car did not have a wrench. We called the hotel, and one of the staff came out immediately to collect us. Over night the hotel arranged for the car to be collected, returned to the rental company and a new (better) car was at the hotel for our use by the time we woke up!This hotel really understand good service and will do what they can do make your holiday amazing",2
"Loved the hotel and overall the staff, very friendly and helpful , always willing to go further. Great breakfast, home made style !!!, great view to the bay . Walking distance to the town. Will stay again",0
"My husband and I stayed with my 15 year old and 10 year old at Semeli in July, rooms were average, not a five star standard, we were at the lower level rooms (400s). I would imagine rooms at upper level are better.The hotel is nice and cosy, location is excellent, very close to the center and all the good restaurants.The pool is not too big but just right for the size of the hotel, I would say that it's not a family hotel, our kids were the only ones there. The service at the restaurant, concierge and reception was excellent, breakfast was very good with a wide selection, coffee was for free but cappuccino was charged as extras, which I thought not appropriate for a 5 star hotel. Lunch menu and food is very good. Rooms were not too clean, our in room coffee cups were not changed sometimes and our bathroom cotton buds and whipes were never replaced, although our towels were changed twice a day. Hotel has a van that can pick u up and drop you off at airport or anywhere around town, complementary. All staff were friendly and helpful, especially Elisa (concierge) and Maria (receptionist)",1
"Went in for one drink on our way out the day we arrived and were extremely well looked after by Sheila, such an amazing lady and so knowledgable about the hotel and the island she made us feel so welcome we ended up staying all night and have been back every night since! Cocktails made by the very talented and skilled barman George are an absolute must! Stunning hotel and such friendly and professional staff can't recommend highly enough.",0
"I've been a regular here for years in this family run five star lodging. The hotel is perfectly located at the entrance to the Chora (town). You enjoy a perched view of the town below and the Aegean beyond, but still you are a five minute walk from the best shopping and the nicest restaurants. Rooms are tasteful and brightly decorated. Breakfast with Katerina and Poppi is a must and is served until midday ( once you get into the Mykonos swing, you'll see how important this is....). All breads, cakes and so on are made in house...I love the place for the people. At the reception you will find an incredibly helpful and effective team...Elisa, Eleni, Maria and our very own Australian Pauli! Reservations with Ketty, who will make impossible arrangements possible. And the team commands respect. They will get you a table or lounge beach bed just about anywhere anytime..! At the bar I can't help but mention Niki, a true charmer..:)If you rent a car, parking is available 24/7 with valet service provided by my friend Julian...Last but not least () Vassilis, the owner's son in law, with whom you can enjoy one of my favorite (and of the Greeks as well!) sports- talking politics..Enjoy it!",1
"Incredible hotel, incredible room, incredible breakfast selection which was included plus good free wifi. The pool area is beautiful too.Close walk to all you need. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!",0
"excellent location: 4 min walk to the bus station, 4 min walk to the shopping area staff is great, the hotel service is wonderfulone could enjoy the lounge bar by the pool or use the second pool that is comes a bit private.the hotel is tech savvy and the rooms are all equipped.I would definitely recommend Semeli.",1
"Semeli hotel is setting the standard in Mykonos Town for outstanding service. A beautiful hotel, near the center, yet away from noise. The staff are excellent. The Thioni restaurant should not be missed. We have tried many restaurants in town, but Thioni is by far the best in quality, ambience, value for money, and exceptional service.",0
"Semeli was literally THE perfect spot for my husband and I! Right on the outskirts of the pedestrian only zone, you can still take a car from the airport / port, and have easy access to drive/get to buses for the beach, but a delightful walk - maybe less than 5min and you are directly in the heart of Mykonos Town (and not so close you are bothered by parties into the night). The pool is fun at the hotel (but of course you are in Mykonos so will hit up the beach!), the free breakfast very good. My husband and I were upgraded on checkin because we were on our honeymoon and so got a fun room with a jacuzzi on the balcony). The staff was helpful (recommending beaches and restaurants) and friendly (always smiles and hellos!). We loved this fun, modern hotel and would definitely return.",1
Love this hotel and staff.Just a perfect place to stay in Mykonos.The girls that serve breakfast each morning are lovely along with the reception staff and management.It's our 4th visit and look forward to our next.,0
"To be fair, this is a very beautiful hotel with amazing staff. It is expensive and is supposed to be a 5 star hotel but it is not good if you are looking for some rest. Quite a disappointment...Summary:(+)Great locationBeautiful decorStaff was very nice and helpfulRooms are stylish and comfortable Breakfast is very good(-)Hotel is very noisy for being close to a park(or school). Noise starts early.Room gets really bright in the morning due to the way the bathroom is integrated to the room. I made ONE REQUEST upon my room reservation: please get me a QUIET ROOM because it will be my honeymoon and my wife and I have been working a lot and we wish to rest. In a very noisy hotel, they managed to get me the noisiest room. Unfortunately, I only realized the reason in my last night there. They gave the room that shared a wall with the closet where the cleaning staff kept all their cleaning equipment. They started making noise really early. The NOISIEST ROOM in the hotel!!! Unbelievable...   Room Tip: Ask for the least noisy room if there is one... See more room tips",1
Fantastic hotel. We stayed here for our honeymoon and the hotel staff were very attentive and friendly. The buffet breakfast is amazing; great options and fresh produce. The rooms are very luxurious and cute; makes for a romantic getaway in Mykonos. Walking distance from Mykonos town and only couple of minutes from the main bus stop that takes you to all the beaches. Pool area is also fantastic.,1
"when we arrived on the island, it as a super windy day but as soon as we checked in to the hotel, we felt that it was too cozy to leave.. the rooms are very clean and well organized.. the breakfast buffet is also recommended.. and location is super because we can walk to town of Little Venice without passing any roads with dangerous traffic at all, there was a truly short cut through the neighbourhood.. loved it..",1
The hotel staff were superb! We had a mix-up in our transfer and they gave us complimentary 30 minute massages as compensation for the error. Our room was modern and clean and steps from the pool. We enjoyed the spa and the ability to walk to everything from the hotel. Everyone at the hotel went the extra mile to make our stay pleasant and comfortable.,1
This hotel is wonderful and close to everything in town! The staff is very helpful in recommending and helping you have a wonderful time in Mykonos! I would stay here again- the accommodations and location are fabulous!,1
"Excellence at its best.A superb hotel with a unique location. Accomodation facilities and service will guarantee you your best holidays ever. Must try Thioni restaurant inside the hotel! Food from heaven, served in a divine view, by the best smiled and so helpful Eleni and Jo and you will feel like a God.",1
This is one of the best hotels in Mykonos and perfectly situated to discover the many restaurants and bares in Mykonos city. It is now my third stay and you are welcomed and treated like family. The majority of the hotel staff is the same and so you are greeted by the same guy at the airport. I recommend to book a room with a sea view and they have a nice size - rooms in Mykonos are not big but there is a sofa and balcony. My favorite in the hotel is the breakfast which is prepared by Poppy and Katharina and the buffet is amazing.,0
"The extremely friendly staff, the charming modern room, the excellent breakfast buffet and the talented bar tender made our stay the perfect bliss. Semeli is conveniently located near the centre of Mykonos Town. I am looking forward to my next stay at Semeli!",1
"Friendly, calm, relaxed hotel with a lovely view over the town. The breakfasts on the terrace were outstanding, and the same goes for the staff, who were all very friendly and helpful, striking the right balance between being efficient and helpful, and not too subservient at the same time. The room (suite) was smaller than we had imagined, and very, not well sound-proofed, so we could hear all the movement from the room above ours, unfortunately. The therapist in the spa does the most amazing massage!",1
"Just had the best 4 night stay in this hotel!! I really can't recommend this place more highly!! The staff were incredible, nothing was too much trouble and super friendly!! The breakfast was amazing, had such a nice homemade touch!! The hotel itself was in prime position to Mykonos town. It was modern and well decorated. Thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay amazing!! I so hope we can come back soon!!",1
"Had the benefit of staying at the Semeli Hotel for four days at the end of May. Everything about the hotel was great from the moment we arrived. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were modern, nicely designed and spotless. The pool area was also fun. The breakfast was good with lots of choices - only minor improvement was that on occasion it felt there was not enough staff when it got busy. We had upgraded to the Executive Room which included a private roof terrace and jacuzzi. We felt that this was really worthwhile and added to our stay. The hotel is very close to Mykonos Town - just a few minute walk to the bars, shops and restaurants. Would definitely return to the hotel.",1
There's a lot to choose from when visiting Mykonos and I can imagine how many different hotels can offer everything you need. Our experience at Semeli Hotel surpassed what we were expecting in a town driven by tourism. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The location is great - a few blocks from the harbor and very near to the main road where you have access to pretty much all of the island. The rooms were clean and spacey and the bathrooms were impeccable and very functional. Semeli runs one of the best breakfast buffets in town I was told and in my experience it was definitely top!,0
"Breakfast buffet food amazing, looking over spectacular views of the port, thanks Poppy. The reception team/management, Pauline, Helen, Elisa, Maria, Katherine and Alex always have a smile to hand and no request is too large or too small. Thanks Eleni and Sheila for recommendations of what's cooking with Chef Igor, which is some of the best food I've had in Mykonos. The ladies who service the rooms are really friendly and always accommodating with the timing. This really is a family hotel and they make you feel part the Semeli family. See you soon.",0
"All the times I've visited Mykonos before , I've always stayed away from Mykonos Town. However, this time I decided to stay in town. It was a good decision. I booked us in the Semeli Hotel! It was an oasis of calm from the moment you step in the reception lobby! The staff at reception were friendly and helpful. When we were shown to our room we felt right at home.The four night break at the Semeli was fab! For the first night we opted to stay for dinner at the hotel and try the Thioni restaurants! Another food choice as were the pre- dinner cocktails!! One of my favourite dishes on the Thioni menu was the octopus with fava.The breakfast was deliciou. Freshly homemade Greek dishes, fresh fruit and Katerina's smile was perfect! The hotel organised our Dilos trip with a private guide which was superb!! We download the Semeli Hotel app and we had Mykonos on our fingertips!!   Room Tip: Ask for the suite with the outdoor jacuzzi! See more room tips",0
"arriving down a steep drive you turn left and enter a wonderful world. it resembles a small greek village except that the entrance is through an indoor/outdoor bar, past a wonderful swimming pool, where the rooms are located off of a small walkway 'road'. the rooms are light and airy yet filled with all amenities, with a modern feeling. white and shades of blue, opening onto charming terraces. there is a lap pool, a gym/spa and a lovely restaurant. the staff are friendly and attentive. the hotel has a welcoming feel.   Room Tip: a little taste of luxury in the center of mykonos town... See more room tips",0
"We absolutely loved our time at the Semeli hotel!! The staff make the hotel so welcoming and they really add an extra buzz to the place! It's perfectly positioned in Mykonos Town and our double room with Seaview was clean, light and had a lovely balcony where we could watch the sunset (although we were often out in the town by then!) Our room was cleaned every day and it was always absolutely spotless. We hired a car so we could explore the beaches and the hotel provide towels for you to take away with you. The pool is lovely and clean although we didn't really use it as we like to get out and see the island. Breakfast was our favourite part of the Semeli, lovely buffet with greek pastries, yoghurt, fruit and cakes and you can also ask for eggs - anyway you like. The Omelette was especially good - again the breakfast team really did go out of their way to give you the perfect start to the day! The concierge team parked our car every day which was great as it can get a little tight outside. The steep slope out of the hotel made driving out of the hotel interesting but all part of the fun! We can't wait to go back!",1
First time in this hotel and I have tried many. Great service And great ambiance. Rooms are large and all with a small balcony. Very modern and specious. Large bathroom. Pool area very chic and clean. Close to the bar. They have some small private pool which are amazing if you want some privacy. Water are surprisingly warm and clean. Very close to the city center 1 min walking. Staff are super nice and friendly. Will definitely return.,1
We were greeted with smiles every time we arrived at the hotel or just left our room We were made to feel part of the FamilyEvery member of staff has such good attitudes and couldn't be more helpfulGreat choice at breakfastLoved our stay Will sooooo return,1
Ideal to explore the town of Mykonos. Great hotel with a contemporary Mykonos flavour. Staff were great and always helpful and the food at the restaurant delicious. Would really recommend it and we'll definitely come back!,1
"Lovely hotel, it's even better in real than the website photos!.Staff were very nice and friendly.Our room was excellent with a great sea view.Breakfast was amazing, loads of choice.Hotel restaurant was fabulous,top marks the chef.We are looking forward to return",1
"The room and bathroom were smaller than what we've come to enjoy while in Greece. We had a junior suite with a hot tub and felt like we were constantly bumping into each other. Only one person could be in the bathroom at a time. The hotel's property, however, was very nice and serene, despite being in the middle of town.   Room Tip: No ocean view room despite what they advertise. See more room tips",0
"A short walk down the alley into the smart part of town centre. Staff is friendly and helpfull. Rooms are elegantly furnished with good bedding. Breakfast Buffet offers a large variety of English, Greek and continental breakfasts. We also had a nice meal with excellent service.Very pleasent bar by the pool.   Room Tip: Good location See more room tips",1
"This isn't the first time we have stayed at this hotel, and it won't be the last. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, and whatever view you have is great. The breakfast (included in the rate) is delicious, and a huge variety. Nice pool, restaurant at the hotel offers great food, whether its something to nibble by the pool, or dinner at night, we had a fantastic stay.   Room Tip: We had a garden view room, very pretty view See more room tips",1
"Came for just four days, beautiful hotel, furnishings, rooms spacious and lovely views. We only had breakfast at the hotel which was lovely, nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff and hotel is in a great location, central to the town. We had a room with a jacuzzi which was lovely although be warned as the tiles on the balcony very slippery resulting in a fall - luckily not serious. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back...",0
"This was a perfect place to stay in Mykonos. Location doesn't get any better...It is a short walk to town, to the bus stop to get to the beaches, and to the port to catch the ferry. The breakfast buffet had a large variety and was delicious. The service was outstanding! There was a ferry strike going on while we were there. We had to catch a 5:30am flight to get to Mykonos, and they let us (and several other guests in the same predicament) check in early with no problem. They were super accommodating! And they were extremely helpful in finding us a way to get to our next island. I cannot say enough good things about the service!! And the rooms were fantastic...we had two rooms, both of which were decorated differently, and both had so much character! We were beyond happy with our stay here!",0
"Central location in Chora, within walking distance to most sights, restaurants, shops.Friendly and professional staff. Front of house as well as bar/restaurant and breakfast. Katerina and the other breakfast lady were very attentive and are in charge of the omelette station (made to order).Nice and plentiful breakfast served until 12, which is a bonus when you want to sleep in.Nice rooms, nice towels and toiletries, loofah, toothbrushes etcModern amenities, including flat screen TV, A/C, safe, electronic ‘do not disturb’ feature.Soft bed. Guests are given a selection of types of pillows to choose from.The hotel itself is typically Myconian and well presented, spread over different levels. Nice furniture and decor throughout. Good wifi throughout the hotel (free).Small, but nice pool. There’s a second pool as well. I’d recommend renting a car to explore the island. There are many nice beaches around eg Lia, Fokos. There’s a concierge/valet service and the parking is underground. It’s on a steep hill and a bit awkward to get out, if there’s traffic, but the valet guys do offer to drive your car up, if needed. Beach and pool towels are provided by the hotel.Hotel gym basic, but modern and handy. Two treadmills, elliptical machine, bicycle, free weights and multi-function exercise machine.Spa/Massage services are excellent and affordable. Panagiotis is a great choice for a deep tissue massage.Hotel restaurant (Thioni) is very good. We opted for the 4 course dinner, which was delicious.   Room Tip: Rooms near the pool can be noisy in the mornings See more room tips",2
"We really enjoyed our stay. Fantastic, modern, quiet and clean room. we had a nice sitting area outside the room and a small private pool. The bed was a bit small, but we managed and overall we were very pleased with the room.The hotel communal areas are very clean, pleasant and beautifully designed.Fantastic location: very close to Mykonos town center. and the staff was super friendly and helpful.Bottom line - we recommend this hotel and will go back.",0
"Came again at short notice and it was tremendous. The atmosphere is very laid back, with attentive customer service. First, the staff here are absolutely brilliant. Warm welcomes from Eleni and Maria at reception - they recognised us from last year and it felt like coming home. Allocated a lovely room with small balcony and view. Bright and sunny. Great recommendations from Sheila and Elisa about where to visit and places to eat. Good humour from bar staff Eleni and Costa. Finally the lovely ladies who looked after us during breakfast - Poppy and Katerina are simply amazing .... even when they are busy, they have a smile for everyone and introduce us to beginners Greek language.Great location - close to town, restaurants and bars.Decor very good and excellent housekeeping all the time",0
"Felt odd to have walk down a steep trail to get to the hotel entrance. But greeted by friendly hotel staffs and they had our room upgraded to junior suites. It was a perfect surprise!The location is perfect. Via a small trail behind the hotel, it leads right to the main food/ shopping streets, which is connected to little Venice etc the attraction spots.Breakfast here is good. Plenty of choices of Greek food. The variety of dessert is different everyday. And you will be greeted warmly by the nice waitresses.To its almost-to-perfection, the after midnight receptionist wasn't seem helpful. Perhaps because it was 12:30am. The gym is quite minimal with only three treadmills, a few Dumbbells and a weight centre. The house keeping is somewhat late (room wasn't cleaned yet at 3pm), but the prompt response has made up for it. We noticed that our towers are being changed twice daily. A big thumbs up to that!Overall, we highly recommend this place for its location, the comfort, the helpful staffs.",0
"Beautiful hotel right in the centre of Mykono town. We walked everywhere. The staff are so nice and friendly. We had a very good time and we were looked after by all staff - from receptionists, waitresses and also the manager. I would definitely come back to this beautiful hotel.",0
"Another fantastic stay at the Semeli in Mykonos. As ever the staff were very friendly, the place relaxing, peaceful and looking great. I have stayed there a few times now and I love coming back. It's situated just a little above the hubbub of the town, which is a prefect location if you want to nightlife, but a place to unwind too. I can't recommend it enough",1
"I spent almost 10 days at the Semeli hotel in May. The hotel has a great location in town (not noisy and easy access to the centre), the rooms are very clean and ""fresh"" looking and even when the hotel is full the place isn't over crowded, which is nice. Breakfast was delicious with a large variety of freshly baked cakes, fruits, pastries or fried eggs to chose from, and it's served till 12 (perfect if you've had a big night of partying or if you simply like to sleep in). The staff is so friendly and always ready to help, which makes you feel like at home in no time! I really enjoyed my stay at Semeli and can't wait to come back! The place is a real gem.",1
"our first visit to Semeli hotel, where we encountered friendly but professional staff. a warm greeting, wonderful breakfasts, clean and well equipped rooms and a great bar and restaurant. the gym is functional, the massages divine and the proximity to town cannot be better! this will definitely not be our last visit...",0
"Excellent location, a minute's walk away from the town, with its charming cobbled streets, cafes,boutique shopping and waterside dining. The hotel is charming, with a stunning Mykonos 'feel': a cool white and blue. Its spotless and clean, amazing spread for breakfast, tiny rooms but all amenities you can think of. The restaurant / bar are a great place to just sit and laze. There's a pool too, and a tiny gym but more trendy than functional. The staff and service is great - attentive and professional, with just the right touch to make it personal. I cant think of staying anywhere else, really.   Room Tip: Ask for the room with the outdoor jacuzzi or the larger room with the tub See more room tips",0
"We stayed here for a 4 night stay in Mykonos. This hotel is in an excellent location as its only a walk away from Mykonos Town. However, that also means it's quite noisy during the day and night. So for those looking to relax, this probably isn't the place for you. The room is a good size with a fairly small bathroom. My only complaints are the mosquitoes. There are swarms of them in the corridors of the hotel and if you leave your window/door open (during house cleaning), they'll get into your room and feed on you. The staff were also helpful and got us a car rental last minute as well. However, the steep slope can be super tricky when you're looking to park your car or get out of the parking. Staff are super helpful and will park your car for you. Not a bad place to stay in Mykonos!   Room Tip: Try to get rooms on a higher level (not basement) to avoid swarms of mosquitoes See more room tips",0
"Really excellent hotel. Rooms were very well equipped and bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent, just a few minutes walk from the gems of Mykonos town like Little Venice and the windmills. Amenities seemed good, although we didn't really take advantage of the pool as it was still a bit chilly out in May. Overall, would recommend this hotel to all. Fabulous experience and amazing staff. Cheers on a great 3 night stay.",0
"My friends and I loved this hotel. The customer service at the hotel was phenomenal. My group got stranded in Athens cause there werehaving a strike. The hotel kindly refunded a day for us. The location was great for us. There was a good convenient store done the hill. The windmills are 5 minutes away. The bus stop for the beaches are 5 minutes the other way. The pools were very well kept. Every morning they were cleaning the grounds queitly. The plants were well kept. Breakfast at the restaurant was delicious. The rooms are cozy, clean and comfortable. The views are great. We had the garden view. It overlooked the second pool. It was nice. The restaurant, Thioni was one of the best in town. Our only hiccup is that there response time for answering emails is not great.",0
"A super cute little hotel located steps away from the delicious little town that is Mykonos. The grounds are teeming with beautiful flowers, trees and shrubs that add a magical wonderland feel to the classic white villas that line the two pools. Reasons for not giving a five star rating (i.e. the picky bit):1/ it's mid-May and the pools were really very bracing - bordering on uncomfortably cold. Hopefully a few more weeks of the Aegean sun and the water will notch up a few degrees2/ the pool towels were a) green and b) a tad thin on the ground. In a five star rated world, clouds and clouds of fluffy white towels would constantly be pushing themselves givingly into your poolside arms3/ the tiles of the larger pool could be a more bleached out shade of azure. I appreciate that this is grimly picky,band I shan't do anything about it4/ lack of total wowage. This can't be particularised, but whilst everything teemed with delight, nothing absolutely knocked my knickers off. Maybe when the season is in full swing and the lovelies punctuate the grounds, sipping on their quotidian spritz, music on and sunsetting, we'd get there. Just not this time!Still however a friendly, gorgeous and fruitful time was spent in picture perfect room 515. Thank you",1
"Es un hotel muy acogedor en Mykonos Town cerca de todo. El personal es muy amable , el restaurante es variado y los alimentos muy bien preparados, es de destacar el bufete del desayuno. Aseado y organizado. No dudaria en volver. It is a cozy hotel in Mykonos Town near everything.The staff is very friendly, the restaurant food is varied and very well prepared, is worth noting the breakfast buffet.Neat and organized.I would not hesitate.",1
"We chose Semeli at Mykonos because of the reviews from other guests who had stayed there previously. It sure didn't disappoint and is well worth the stay!Noting that we were on our honeymoon, the hotel had kindly upgraded us to a better suite with a garden view, complimentary. It sure made our day during the check-in process.Great compliments to both Emmanuel and Pauline who had helped us with our questions on how to get to various locations on the island, as well as, helping us to navigate our way around the hotel. Thank you both very much!The hotel is located just above the old port. about 5-10 min walk and you will reach the old port or to the famous windmills. Sure is conveniently located!Recommended to anyone who is considering Semeli Hotel! Kudos once more for taking great care of us during our stay!",0
"The hotel has the best position in Chora Mikonou. It is walking distance from all the shops, restaurants, famous spots, old and new harbour, glamorous night clubs, bars etc.The rooms are wonderful, very clean ( 2 times a day, cleaning lady) spacious and with a great view. The staff is amazing: especially thanks to Mrs. Cathy, Mrs. Gilardi, ladies from the reception, Iulian ( parking and transport), Mrs. Jo and Eleni ( ladies from the restaurant/bar). Thioni restaurant serves great food beautifully decorated that tastes like heaven! I truly recommend this unique hotel.   Room Tip: Try room 722.....suits a family of three and has a big jacuzzi on the terrace See more room tips",0
"An excellent way to spend a night of relaxation and comfort when being in a business trip. In the town of Mykonos, few minutes from the sea shore, with a relaxing spa and an excellent swimming pool. Rooms are white like the hole island mood, comfortable and with a small pleasant spa inside the bathroom, which can make a huge difference when you are tired and stressed. As for a holiday destination is a very good choise, especially if you can find a good offer. The hotel is a member of a group of companies which also have many beautiful places to eat or drink, spending unique moments at the island.",0
"The hotel is in the city, not too far from the ""marina."" I believe this hotel is rated 5 stars, we found it to be just ok. Perhaps it's because we just spent 3 days in Oia, Santorini at a very nice, 5+ star hotel (Adronis Luxury Suites) and this hotel doesn't compare... our room/suite was very small and the walls dividing the room from the main area and bathroom did not go all the way up to the ceiling! You can hear every noise inside and outside. Our patio, which had a hot tub, was very tight, 2 people could hardly move around. The staff were fine, although we found the front desk ladies to be more accommodating then the rest of the staff. The grounds are kept very nice and the main pool/bar area is a plus. All and all we probably wouldn't pay the amount of money we did to stay at Semeli Hotel IF we were to visit Mykonos agaim.",0
"My bf and I went there for 5 nights. This hotel is about 15mins away from airport by taxi and was about 15€. Really nice hotel with a quite nice pool, bar and restaurant. As we arrived quite late, we decided to eat at hotel's restaurant: not a lot of choices but the octopus and beef filet were amazingly tasty!! Breakfast can be eaten outside or inside with a variety of sweet and salty food. Nice reception service with 24h available if needed. We loved our room with Jaccuzi but sadly couldnt enjoy it to the max with a few days of wind. A lot of resaturants, bars and small shops.(as it is not the season, not every shops are open)Nice rooms, good location (10 mins walk to the old port) , good service! everything was nice there! Enjoyed our stay in the hotel and in the beautiful Mykonos!",1
I would live here permanently! Attentive and friendly staff. Hearty breakfast. Wonderfully designed rooms. I would recommend to anyone who comes to mykonos if you arent on a tight budget. Convenient location to the town centre and also to other facilities eg supermarket,1
"Our taxi driver claimed this was the best hotel in Mykonos....I hope not. It is nice enough, but you are basically in a concrete room with a small outside area with most rooms separated from the adjacent property by a walkway. There is no soundproofing and the only vent in the bathroom is a small window that opens to the public area (i.e. you can hear someone speaking in a low tone of voice). I was there out of season so the price-value is reasonable. In season the same room goes for 3X as much.....then the price/value is very low unless you absolutely need to be there for the dance halls, the bars or the beaches.Pros: gracious staff; scrupulously clean; sea view rooms have a good view over the tops of the houses to the sea; parking garage; on-site bar; nice outdoor space (balcony or patio); wi-fi free & okay; one of the few places with a pool; and, it looks good from the outside.Cons: no soundproofing; mediocre furniture (i.e. uncomfortable); pretty basic heating/cooling system; mediocre breakfast; and expensive for what the size/comfort of the rooms.   Room Tip: the sea view rooms are on the 2nd level....much better light and above the foot traffic. See more room tips",0
"Visited Semeli for the 4th time as a cheeky last week of the season. Whilst many hotels would have been preparing for closing, Semeli and its wonderful staff were in fine form, as welcoming as they are in high season. The hotel is ideally placed, clean, relaxed and just the perfect place to stay. So good I'm going back in June for 2 weeks! Can't wait.",0
"We had a wonderful stay at Semeli Hotel. We arrived in Mykonos on a very early flight & after getting to the hotel early, the staff made every effort to welcome us & even allowed us to check in earlier. Everyone is exceptionally friendly, from the front desk, to the restaurant & even housekeeping. The location & facilities are excellent too. We loved their Thioni restaurant, it was great to have such exceptional food available right in the hotel. The location is perfect. Perched halfway up the hill, it is a 5 minute walk to the shops below & around the corner from the bus stop/quad rentals. It's just outside the hustle & bustle which makes it quiet & peaceful. The breakfast buffet is great, far more than anyone actually needs - but delicious! We had a superior double room on the lower floor, close to the pool, & it was all we needed (we enjoy taking in the view by being outside). Our room was serviced twice a day and impeccably clean. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and will definitely return in the future. Thank you for an awesome holiday!",2
"Semeli is a great hotel in Mykonos- a bit of a walk from the wharf but close enough to restaurants. The breakfast in the morning had a lot of good variety. The room was spacious- a little bit old, the only thing was the bathroom door couldn't close completely. Otherwise a great hotel.",2
"The location is great as the hotel is located just outside the pedestrian area of the town.My room was ""vintage & nice"". You could see some signs of the years, but overall I had the feeling to be in ""vacation in Mykonos"" and I liked my room.The breakfast was poor to average, and not aligned with the expectation of a luxury hotel. The view of the restaurant into a Kindergarden did not help the experience...The service was caring and professional throughout the stay.Worth trying again and check if they ""fixed"" the breakfast.",0
"my best friend and i visited this hotel in November.Even it was low peak period,it didn't once feel end of season.Clean hotel and well decorated.I loved everything about their design.Especially the lobby area.Warm and cozy atmosphere.Ending your day with a drink at the reception area ,after walking around all day, was so relaxing and rewarding.Perfect location walking distance to the central of Chora and less than 10 min to the airport.Breakfast was amazing.We couldn't ask for more options.The best part....it was served until 12am.Regarding the parking,we didn't have any problems since the porters took over it.Friendly staff from the reception to the maids.The lady who helped out with breakfast is worth a particular mention.Hard working,fast,thoughtful and always with a smile.Check in and check out procedures were quick but they didn't spend any time to inform us about basic information.Not even the wifi code.When we ask though for their help they were polite and willing.Wifi access was exceptional during our whole stay.All in all, i would stay again.Wonderful stay.",1
"Excellent hotel. Great breakfast! Just a little hard to find but helpful people along the way. End of season, lucky with the weather. A number of shops and restaurants already closed. Staff were extremely helpful. Very close to bus stop and easy to get to beaches.",2
"This hotel is perched on the edge of town, wonderfully convenient. It is beautifully appointed and spacious. The staff were unfailingly helpful, with valet parking the car to making dinner reservations. The bar area is lovely for sundowners, the restaurant is excellent too. The breakfast spread is superb (especially for Greece), and the ladies will fetch you coffee and make you omelettes to your taste.We hardly used our jacuzzi deck, but you can entertain friends on it. The rooms are small but well appointed. The cleaning staff are sweet and accommodating.The gym is tiny but you can do some exercise and weight training. The pool area is lovely and fairly wind sheltered. The pool is a joy.We will be back I suspect!   Room Tip: A sea view room away from reception and not overlooking the pool is recommended. See more room tips",1
"Stayed at this very charming quaint hotel for 8 nights recently ( from sept. 24th to oct. 2nd ) and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel has been completely refurbished but kept its old charm flavor in the process. Rooms are bright and comfortable and very clean. We were happily upgraded to a seaview room upon arrival which was greatly appreciated. The breakfasts are fabulous and plentiful, with fresh eggs cooked to your liking, and the service throughout is excellent with a friendly and joyful staff. Appreciated the kind availability of the reception staff in giving out useful information on places to eat and visit. Finally, one of the advantage of this hotel is its great location, within a short walking distance to fine restaurants, shops, little Venice, and the old port. Highly recommended hotel. Many thanks to all the great staff.Normand C.   Room Tip: The seaview rooms are definitely a must with a good size balcony and breathtaking views of the port... See more room tips",3
"Staff and hotel just fabulous.Fabulous location and amazing that so close to the town centre but so quiet.The staff couldn't do enough to help and were genuinely happy.The spa area is lovely.Small fitness room, but adequate   Room Tip: It's a town hotel, so rooms not big, decide if you want a larger balcony/smaller room, or larger... See more room tips",2
"This hotel is a boutique hotel 2 min walk from town. There is a supermarket and coffee place close by. You can walk to just about everything except the beach. We rented ATV's and went. It was 10mins down the road. Water was calm and relaxing. Loved every minute of this hotel. Several pools. Breakfast had alot of choices and was included. The room was very comfortable. The beds gave us a great night sleep. Pillows that your head sink into. Big fluffy towels. Shower was a treat. Several different spray options. Lets just say i took long showers while there. The amenities - shampoo, conditioner - great products. Very clean. Not one bit of dust or mold anywhere and believe me i check for that. Very pretty - they light the pool different colors at night. Plenty of room to relax. We even had a little balcony with 2 chairs and a table that overlooked the pool. The front desk personnel were very helpful any time we went to ask a question. They even took us complementary to a place where we could see a beautiful sunset. There are beaches and ATV rentals in walking distance. I only stay in 5 star properties and am very critical when reviewing. Have to say I hated having to leave this place. I really couldn't find anything i disliked.   Room Tip: Rooms overlooking the pool See more room tips",3
"Perfectly located hotel --walk to town, old port, ATV rentals. Property exterior needs updating, rooms fairly sized and clean, breakfast buffet had ample choices although they could use more early morning staff for serving.Exceptional sevice by Pauline at the front desk who went above and beyond to accomodate the needs of her guests. Exceptional service all around making the experience at this hotel a pleasure!! Also note that this hotel is 5 minutes from the airport and the hotel can provide complimentary transportation if requested and available. Do not pay more than 10 euros by taxi.",3
"We loved our 10 day stay at the Semeli Hotel - Great Location !This hotel has much on offer, our room - pristine contemporary modern and chic, cleverly styled with subtle hints of aqua blue to remind you that your on a fabulous Greek Island. Room and bathroom amenities rated 10/10The hotel facilities include a nice pool and a small gym. A real stand out, ALL the Semeli staff - genuine warmth, engaging, knowledgeable, service professionals. Front desk staff, Pauline & Eleni - outstanding guest relations.Greek breakfast at the Semeli is a highlight - prepared each day (by a dedicated lady named ""Catherine"") the food - fresh, healthy, wide choice, tastes like it was made with love.Thank you Semeli Very memorable experience, we will be back :-)",3
"Four of us stayed here to celebrate 2 birthdays in the group and the hotel was lovely. Everywhere was kept immaculately clean and we had our beds turned down every evening. We were well looked after in the mornings at breakfast, especially by Katerina, though the ladies are very busy during this time, so it is worth getting any requests in as soon as you sit down. The hotel is ideally situated near to the town with a few steps and small incline but nothing in comparison to many others on the island.We all used the spa and can highly recommend the treatments. The only negative is that there aren't many spaces around the pool, but with so many beautiful beaches, it wasn't really a problem. I would definitely go back.",1
"This is a great boutique hotel in Mykonos. We had an incredible time! The service, food, amenities are all perfect. The bar is a lot of fun and very lively, friendly staff, great ambiance. It's perfectly situated in the heart of Mykonos town. The only downside is that the rooms are small.",0
When I landed on Mykonos island I didn't knew what to Expect? Surprisingly the hotel was cosi with a warm welcome and the best value for money. Keeping that in mind you can't ask for extra pampering or exquisite services. If you're a millionaire with high standards forget about it. But if you are on a budget and want to save money for nightlife without compromising this is the hotel you have wanted.,1
"Considering the price they charged for the room (290 Euros/night), I was disappointed with the following things: At the breakfast buffet, it took the ladies ages to bring you coffee or tea. Most days we had already halfway finished when they finally showed up. Sometimes they were busy cleaning the floors instead. Also, the coffee is terrible and they charge extra if you ask for a cappuccino instead. Since the tea bags are already out, they should just put hot water out, too, for the guests to make tea themselves. And they should put the coffee out too, since it is only burnt filter coffee anyway. Also, half the trays of the hot buffet like eggs, sausages and vegetables were always empty. Every day. And there weren't even so many guests there at the end of September. Disappointing. In our room, the little bottles with shower gel were not replaced the first 3 days, so we ran out. Luckily, we had brought some of our own. After that, they refilled stuff we still had, which resulted in us having 6 bottles of conditioner but no shower gel. Annoying... On the plus side, the hotel is nicely located within 3 mins walking distance to the center, but still far enough to keep away the noise. Staff at reception were always nice and helpful. All in all Semeli is overpriced, though.",2
It was one of the best boutique hotels i have ever stayed in centrally located super friendly and helpful staff wonder buffet breakfast great restaurant for dinner multiple pools lounge with every room and state of the art shower area,2
"The Hermes Mykonos Hotel was the perfect spot for our group vacation. It is a short walk into town, and I’m happy that it isn’t right in town as it can be quite rowdy until early in the morning. The views from the hotel are stunning, and the rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. The breakfast has everything one might want, and to have that view while you eat is wonderful! The entire staff was friendly and helpful…from the front desk to the breakfast crew to the cleaning staff. I have to especially mention Manos, who works at the pool. He is extremely friendly and helpful, always right there when you need him, bringing you food or drink or making suggestions both for the menu and for the best things to do in Mykonos. He made life so easy I hardly wanted to leave the hotel. I hope to return to Mykonos, and when I do, I will most certainly go back to the Hermes Mykonos Hotel.",0
Hermes Mykonos hotel is located in a very fortunate corner of the island close to the Xopa center and with breathtaking view. My room was large and very clean. The staff and the owners are friendly and supportive. The breakfast is however not consistent with the rate applied to the room and proved very basic with a restricted selection of courses.,0
"I recently returned from a 10 day stay at the Hermes Hotel in Mykonos, and while I don't normally post reviews, upon reflection and comparison of other hotels I've stayed at, I was compelled to share with you how absolutely perfect this hotel was for our group. When we first arrived, they had ample room for parking our rental cars and scooters for others. When we walked in, the view was stunning. Pictures posted do not do the lobby justice. It is absolutely gorgeous. The check-in staff was very accommodating to our needs and switched us to a junior suite when we explained our needs (a little bit of privacy from one another). This hotel also offers a very nice breakfast buffet (included in the price of the room) with an amazing view. This comes in very handy as many places do not open early in the morning, and is a great way to fill up before your day's adventure if you dare to wake up before noon. Next on the agenda was to check out the pool. Although small, and sometimes short of chairs, you wouldn't want it any other way; as the gem of the Hermes Hotel is located right there. Manos, the pool bar manager is by far the best amenity any hotel in Mykonos as to offer, and the Hotel Hermes is the lucky place to have him. He makes you feel like you are right at home in your own private pool. It doesn't take long for this charming and attentive chap to quickly figure out exactly what you want, when you want it and delivers it as if he's reading your mind. One never has to wait to place an order with him, and he's always there with a helpful suggestion. He's extremely hard working and always smiling and happy. He was super helpful with tips and tricks for Mykonos, even though the hotel also offers a concierge service. My only warning to you is that once you meet Manos, you may miss out on exploring other parts of Mykonos, because you want to go anywhere else! I could go on forever, but on top of the countless reasons to stay at Hotel Hermes, Manos is reason enough to stay there.Finally, the staff was extremely accommodating on our groups last day. They extended to us a late check out, and allowed me to spend the day in the lobby (and at the pool with Manos) until I had to leave at 7. They made sure I was well taken care of, made sure my cell phone was charged, brought me a laptop to check in for my flights, Manos made sure I always had a drink in hand and a bite to eat no matter where I snuck off to. The icing on the case was that after a long day in the sun, they have private pool side showers where I was able to clean up and change clothes before my overnight flights. In summary, Hotel Hermes is the place you want to stay. Great location, amazing rooms, staff as friendly as if they were old friends, and of course, Manos. The price you pay is a discount compared to the stuffy service one would get at an international 5 star location!Can't wait to go back.   Room Tip: I was inside of four different rooms, I could not honestly say one was better than the other. See more room tips",0
We had the view of the city and ocean. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean. The balcony made it more inviting. The host and hostess were very nice and welcoming. Thank you all for making our vacation so much fun and restful. We will be back.   Room Tip: Get the rooms with balcony overlooking the city. See more room tips,0
"Hotel is located in a very accessible area, close to the port and Mykonos town. The rooms are very clean and the hotel grounds/pool are aesthetically pleasing as well. When we checked in initially we were given a room that hadn't been completely renovated (older bathroom etc...) so we asked if there were any other suites available, room 210 was and it was perfect. Wifi worked extremely well in room as well (was able to stream).",0
Hermes was a great hotel. The rooms were very modern and the hotel was very clean and pretty. The view was very nice. The staff were very friendly and gave helpful advice. The breakfast was very good as well. Only issue is the walk into town. It is about a 15 minute walk down a hill. It was worth the stay since the hotel was so great and staff so helpful. I would recommend this hotel!,0
Great Hotel with very clean room and an amazing view on the city. A special thanks to the very kind and welcoming Personnel of the Hotel. I would improve with more variety the breakfast otherwise my vote is 9/10Best regardsFrancesco,0
"The service at this hotel was top notch. Amazingly friendly staff! Amazing pool, pool side service, and you can order food at the pool bar! Amazing view from the seaview rooms. Would definitely stay here again! My only complaint about the rooms was that there were a few ants.   Room Tip: The seaview rooms were well worth it! See more room tips",0
"Spent 4 or 5 nights in Mykonos at Hermes, the place is beautiful, you walk in and its all white marble, white furniture, with a fantastic view of the Sea. The room was great we had a little patio area where you could watch an amazing sunset. The staff was incredibly helpful all the time. They picked us up and dropped us off from the airport, and gave great suggestions on what to do on specific days. They had an awesome pool that you could lay out and catch some sun if interested, and great food available onsite. It is a little bit of a walk to get to town, and the way back is up-hill, but my calves look great now because of it.",0
"This was our 2nd stay at Hermes Hotel as we loved it so much last year. The hotel is perfectly located above the town with stunning views over the bay. Get a sea view room so you can watch the sunset in the evenings! The rooms are a decent size, clean and modern and the staff really friendly and helpful. Top marks go to Manos who looks after the pool bar every day - awesome cocktails thanks Manos!! The hotel will collect you from the airport for free - just drop them an email with your flight number and arrival timeOur only negative was that our first night there was a mix up with the booking and we had to stay in a different hotel (just over the road) for one night - we were refunded half the price for that night and the staff we're really apologetic. They went out of their way to sort us out, and the other hotel was lovely anyway (Hotel Margie)The path down to Mykonos town is a bit precarious in the dark - if you're not fit and healthy it may be a struggle, but its really not that far. Its a 5 minute walk down to town, and 10 minute climb back up (if you're sober......)   Room Tip: Spend some days by the pool, Manos will look after you! See more room tips",1
"We enjoyed our 10 night stay at the Hermes hotel. The hotel is very clean and the cleaners do a thorough daily clean in your bedrooms. The bedrooms overlook a beautiful sun set with a good size balcony. Bathrooms are also decent sized and modern. The only thing missing from the bedroom itself was a mirror, we didn’t have a mirror in the bedroom, only the bathroom which was a bit odd when getting dressed.The pool area is lovely but there is a bit of an issue during the busy period with sun beds. We were a group of 6 so had to get up early to get our sun beds, some days are easier than others. The breakfast is your standard continental breakfast, can get repetitive, but that’s expected.The staff were really friendly and helpful, happy to book our restaurants reservations, taxis and boat trips.It’s about a 10/12 minute walk to town, but an extremely unsteady walk, all downhill on the way there but extremely steep the way back. It’s also very cobbly and uneven grounds so don’t bother bringing high heels (ladies). Still, a fine walk.Overall impressed with hotel and would recommend.",0
The rooms did not have any draw space so we had to leave our clothes in our suitcases. On 3 separate days at different times in the afternoon we tried to get 2 lounge chairs for the pool but none were ever available. We had to sit in sun in regular chairs that had no umbrellas. The bartender was very nice & provided great service. It was very windy when we there so we did not enjoy sitting out by the pool anyway. Without a car there wasn't much to do - to go to town you had to walk down or up a steep hill which was difficult in the heat. It was also a bit scary at night as it was deserted. You could not rent a car to go to town either as cars are not allowed. Taxis drop you off far away & we also learned later that they charged us double what they should have!,1
This hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Our room had a spectacular view of myknos town. Although some would find the walk into town fairly steep it is well worth the view. I highly recommend this hotel. Everything was first class.,0
Hotel is so much better then expected.The rooms are to die for and the sea views are amazing. You get to see the sunset every night too.Reception staff are fantastic but the bar man Manos is the BEST.In the pool area there is a bar and Manos is your guy. He will get you anything you need whether its drinks or snacks by the pool. He's very welcoming and happy to answer any questions. After only 3 nights we wanted to fly him home with us. Our family looked at him like a part of our own. He will make your experience all worth it.As for location its an easy walk down but unless the sun has set the walk back can be very hot.All worth it though in the end. Highly recommend this place to stay.,0
"Delicious breakfast, lots of selection. Poolside bar that served great drinks and food. Perfect walking distance to downtown Mykonos. Would definitely stay here again in the future. Rooms were clean, and all we were upgraded to a room with a view",0

"We stayed at Hermes for 3 nights. First time in Mykonos. We read most ofThe review about the hotel and then decided to stay here. Mostly the location. You are 10' m walk from the heart of the city, where all bars and Resturants are located. To reach out the beaches you must get a car, or a bike, otherwise you will see only the most crowed beaches according to our experience. The room we had was so amazing, sea view balcony and just across the reception and breakfast hall. Quite hotel with great team, fromThe guy at the breakfast, super friendly to the front office girls, so helpful until the managers, all were so nice and gave us best tips to eat in Mykonos, local experience kinda of things. Wish we could stay longer here. But we willCom back, keep up the great job Hermes team and thank you so much for this special days.",0
"Hermes is .5 km from mykonos town, and the distance provides a good break from the late-night party environment of the island. Close to everything and enough space to get a good night's sleep. Strong recommend. Great room, pool, staff. Shuttle will pick you up from the airport or ferry, which is good, since there are a limited number of cabs. Mykonos is great, but probably best suited for the 20- to 30-year old set.",0
"This hotel was great! My husband and I arrived to the Hermes Mykonos to find that there had been a mistake and we were asked to stay a sister hotel for a night which we loved. Then we came back to this hotel for one night as well. The rooms are small but lavishly decorated. Very clean and classy. I walked into the room and immediately enjoyed it. Then we opened the curtains to see our view of the city and the ocean made me fall in love with this hotel. It was so perfect and peaceful in the room. The hotel itself was very busy, but the staff were very helpful and we had an absolutely wonderful experience!",0
"A very very nice hotel with the best staff. Extraordinay view over Mykonos city center. Best hotel in Mykonos !!!! I will recomended to everyone, couples, families with small kids and even to older people, it's a dream hotel!",0
"Just returned from a week at Hermes and would thoroughly recommend. Arrived at the airport to a smiley friendly man waiting holding a sign for us, and a nice air conditioned ride to the hotel. The airport transfers are free which is great. Hotel is spotlessly clean & decorated mainly in white, with amazing views down over the town and the sea. Reception staff are so helpful and during our time there they gave us maps, told us which beaches were quiet or party beaches, best & cheapest restaurants, hired a car for us, ordered a takeaway for us when we were dying of hangovers - they were great. Our room (superior with sea view) was also spotless with a very comfy king bed (some sort of mattress topper on it - we both slept very well indeed) and a little balcony looking over the sea. The road down to town is at the front of the hotel so the balcony looks out over it, it's quite loud in the day but fine later on, and we quite enjoyed watching the crazy Greeks driving up & down and doing mad U-turns! Shutters on the balcony doors block out all light too so you don't get woken up at first light. The bathroom was absolutely fantastic, having visited many Greek Islands over the years the plumbing & bathroom situation is sometimes a bit hit & miss but this bathroom wouldn't have been out of place in a top London hotel - one of the best rainfall style showers I've ever used, and a pretty fancy sink. Was so lovely to be able to have a great shower in the morning and not have to worry about the toilet not flushing properly etc! The pool bar run by a lovely funny bartender, Manos, has great comfy sunbeds & umbrellas and wasn't too busy. There is chill out music playing and the cocktails he makes are the best we had on the island and cheaper at €10 (it's approx €15 in town and not nearly as good). There is also a pool bar snack menu with Greek salads, pizza, chips, etc which is reasonably priced. It was nice to chill out there in the day when it was too hot in town and have Manos bring us cocktails (also great free WiFi available so husband could watch the Grand Prix...)Breakfast is nice but not a great amount of choice and the same things every day. Greek yoghurt and honey was lovely. Selection of pastries, cereals, ham & cheese slices, bacon, fried and scrambled eggs. All buffet style not cooked to order. Nice coffee. The walk down to town centre is 10 mins and quite steep - there are 2 pedestrian paths down, one steeper than the other but both pretty steep. The walk up is quite tough especially in the heat. We asked reception about car hire and a company down the road picked us up from hotel and took us to get one, it was expensive at about £100 for 2 days in a little yellow Fiat Panda but was good to drive to the other side of the island and go to a few beaches and less expensive more traditional style tavernas. All in all had a lovely time here and although it was a bit pricier than we are used to in Greece, that is Mykonos, everything is quite pricey. Would definitely return to Hermes.

"Another holiday with friends who had stayed in this very hotel a year or so ago. Everything is so clean, tidy and well presented. Our room is a good size and the Ocean View is stunning. Really comfy bed Great bathroom - I could stay in the shower all day. Only thing missing from the room is a full length mirror, but not a big deal really. Breakfast is good - very laid back so don't worry too much about wandering down just before 11am (as we did some mornings). Loved the pool and loungers - not a huge pool but lovely just the same. Comfy loungers and most of the time felt like it was our own private pool. The service can't be faulted here. Everyone is lovely and can't do enough for you. We have a few more days left of our holiday and we'll truly be sad to leave this place. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here again. (Room 109 view).",0
"The room was cool and modern with a nicely finished bathroom. We had beautiful views of the water and a easy ride to town via a 3-wheeler. Nice breakfast buffet and relaxing pool with bar. The staff was friendly but not as easy going as some of the other hotels we stayed in while in Greece.   Room Tip: Pay the extra for a sea view, it's worth it. See more room tips",0
"This hotel oozes comfort, serenity and coolness in its all white interior. The setting is just above the old town with spectacular views of the town and bay. Rooms are comfortable and carries through the white decor. Breakfast is great and the staff, in particular Maria behind the reception desk and Manush at the pool bar, are extremely friendly and very helpfull.",0
Stayed at the Hermes for 3 nights and wish I could have extended our stay.From check in to check out and everything in between was great.Beautiful well kept rooms with nice views from the sea side balconies.Breakfast was nice too lots of variety and fresh food.The pool was great and a refreshing welcome for the summer heat.This hotel should be your choice when staying in Mykonos. Highly recommend it!,0
"This was a very pleasant hotel the staff were nice and helpful but for us there were too many stairs to our room,the alternative offered was too near the main road,we paid for an upgrade with sea view but traffic noise spoilt it for us the motor bike noise was awful.yes we could have closed window but what was point paying to sit out on balcony with sea view then.breakfast was lovely good choice and pick up from airport much appreciated.the pool was lovelly was a shame there was no chance of food when ag pool it was a pain having to go and get changed to eat out at lunch time pool snacks would have been a bonus.",0
"Great two nights in Mykonos with day 1 at the pool absorbing the spectacular views. Staff were all so helpful and friendly. Hotel is immaculately clean without a spot detected on the traditional white-washed walls. The room was a good size with a quaint balcony overlooking the city and the Aegean. On a map, the walk into town might seem a bit distant, but I would give up proximity to the city for an unforgettable view, peace and tranquility. If you're up for a bit of exploration, the reception can organize a rental from the nearby Assimomitis car rental office. They provide super customer service, too, and were highly professional, thus making the experience at Hermes delightfully positive.",0
"The Hermes Mykonos Hotel is perfect for a stay in Mykonos. We were there for 2 nights at the start of the month - the pickup from the airport wasn't a problem, the staff were delightful, the room was clean, comfortable and modern and it is in a great location.Some bus routes pass by the hotel, making it super convenient, otherwise it is a 5-10 minute walk downhill to get in to town. The walk back up from town is steep, so just be prepared upfront and you'll be fine!This hotel was honestly one of the best experiences we had in a month of travelling through Europe!   Room Tip: Sea view - the balcony opens up to a view of Mykonos town See more room tips",0
"My partner and I have stayed here many times over the last few years. Every spring we start thinking about holidays""where shall we go"" we look at each other yep The Hermes, Mykonos. Picked up at the airport, a warm welcome from Margarita and her Mother, cool beer , and relax, perfect.We stayed here for 11 nights this time and it was made even more enjoyable thanks to Manos, serving food and drinks at the pool, lots of laughs, jokes and banter, and Panos at breakfast, fun when you start translating Greek to English and back again.Because we had a later flight we were able to keep our room a bit longer, perfectWe will be back next yea",0
We stayed for 7 nights at the Hotel and wish our stay was longer. The rooms and surrounding areas were very clean and tidy and all the staff were really helpful. The pool area was kept tidy and we were looked after very well by Manos the barman.The receptionists were very infomative and told us which places to visit and gave restaurant recomendations too. The walk into town was easier on the way down than up but only took 5-10 mins. It was mainly the heat that made it harder to walk uphill.I would definately recommend the hotel as the best I have stayed in any of the Greek Islands and Mykonos is a place I will return to.Mr & Mrs Brasinos :-)   Room Tip: Ground floor room had a bigger balcony See more room tips,0
"We stayed 5 nights at Hermes and were very impressed. The location was great - at the top of a hill with amazing views, in a quiet area, but only a 10 minute walk into the town. There are restaurants near the hotel if you don't feel like walking into town. The walk into town is easy, but slightly harder on the way back due to the hill, but still easily walkable.The hotel facilities were excellent, with a lovely pool area to spend a relaxing day, and a great dining area for breakfast with a view.All the staff were wonderful, right from the pickup transfer, to check in, cleaners and pool bar. They were all very friendly, welcoming and helpful.Our room was great too. A good size, very modern, clean, and had all the amenities you could need. We had a sea view room, and it was fantastic to sit on the patio with a glass of wine and enjoy the amazing view.Highly recommended for a stay in Mykonos, and I hope we will return again some day!",0
My wife and I traveled here last year. Was unsure where to stay in mykonos but this place proved to be a great choice. It's located on the hill above mykonos town. 10-15 minute walk into town (walk back is a bit of an exercise but I enjoy burning the calories from my heavy meals :)). Service was top notch and rooms were great. We rented an atv to go to all the beaches which was a lot of fun.,1
"My friend and I stayed 3 nights in early June 2016 in the Hermes Hotel. We were picked up from the ferry by the hotel which we certainly appreciated. Then we proceeded to have 3 absolutely lovely days in Mykonos with the Hermes being home base. The view of the sea from out second story balcony was gorgeous. The room was very well done in white walls and white marble floors with vibrant fuchsia accents. The bathroom had a gorgeous tub which I am still regretting not ever using since I was always running late and had to just quickly shower. Breakfast was included and had a great variety of foods and drinks. Still, the thing that put this hotel over the top for us was the staff. Everyone from the woman at the front desk, to the young man who brought out bags up, to the smiling housekeeping staff, made us feel so welcome. I'd have to say that the poolside bartender wins the prize for really helping to make our stay there special. Manos was so easy going and friendly and just an all around a terrific bartender. He went above and beyond what he had to in order to ensure we enjoyed ourselves. He was happy to chat with us and tell us about local life in Mykonos, or to whip up a frozen cocktail that was new to him, a Miami Vice (1/2 pina colada & 1/2 strawberry daiquiri... soooo good!). My only complaint was that I could not hear the music that he was playing when I was lounging at the front of the pool. He told me new speakers were ordered, but were 2 weeks from being installed. Anyway, thank you Manos, Panos, and everyone at the Hermes for making our stay so wonderful. We hope to come back soon!",0
Stayed there for one week and everything was absolutely perfeaLoved the fact that it was a family run hotel but the rest the staff was also excellent.They helped us rent a car but before this they gave us a lift down town twice without any charge!Breakfast excellent!Modern minimal decor!   Room Tip: we stayed on the ground level but it was very nice because the rooms still have a view and a small... See more room tips,0
"The Hotel is so clean and chic. We loved our Pink room that was upgraded by a sweet Lady Anna , she was a great help to us from the start in arranging our pick up to our drop off back to Athens. We have missed our ferry from Athens in the Morning and took the one for 4 pm and still she re-send the driver to pick us up without hesitation. The Breakfast was so yummy and there was one handsome boy working there always helpful, same like the Pool Bar boy (Sorry cant remember their Greek names).   Room Tip: Very Chic hotel and the location is fantastic See more room tips",0
"Hermes hotel was a lovely place to spend a few days. Complementary airport pickup & drop off. All staff were really polite, welcoming & smiling. Upon arrival they kindly showed me two different rooms to choose from (bigger room & terrace versus slightly better views of the town & sea). Hotel & grounds were absolutely spotless & have been really tastefully decorated with white marble everywhere & the rooms were lovely & stylish - in particular the bathroom - with beautiful Korres toiletries & stone basins - my favourite hotel bathroom in a while (wish I'd taken a photo as it was so much nicer than the pictures posted on here!)I haven't given the hotel a 5 for a couple of minor reasons. The location was ok (only a short 10 min walk to town) but i didn't love it & felt a little uncomfortable walking home in the dark by myself (solo female). (There was lots of parking available onsite if you had a car).I also found the hotel lacked a bit of atmosphere - maybe this was heightened by the fact I was travelling solo, perhaps for couples it wouldn't matter as much (though this is something my husband & I do always appreciate). Music everywhere - reception etc - would help? The pool area was ok but a bit low key - needs better music & poolside vibe/ service to guests on loungers etc, there was no restaurant.All in all though, did really enjoy the stay - would recommend to the likes of my parents (late 50s), as I think they'd really love it.",0
"Experience at Hermes is one of my best experience ever. They offer a free pickup and i had no idea about it. They sent me email one day prior asking my arrival time so that they can arrange pickup. Pickup was smooth and cool. Check in was awesome two girls at reception not only helped us understanding everything about hotel but also guided us about all good locations in Mykonos, they upgraded our room and given a tour of Hotel I truly appreciate their humble nature. Room was clean and big. It has an amazing balcony with beautiful sea view. Breakfast so nice, fresh and with lots of choices. If you are planning to visit Mykonos and reading this review i 100% assure you that you will not be disappointed if you choose this Hotel. It is just amazing. Thank you Hermes for making our stay amazing, we loved it.   Room Tip: Choose Sea View Rooms See more room tips",0
"My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon and had a great time! First, the view on the water is so beautiful. The hotel is super clean and the staff is very helpful. We are about 10-15 minutes walk from the mykonos town so it is very well situated. A special thank you to Ana and Maria who gave us great tips on where to go and to Panos who worked at the breakfast buffet and always had a great smile and made us start our day well ! !I definitely recommand this hotel to anyone staying in Mykonos",2
"Nothing but praise for Hermes! Great location (you do have to walk down a path into town) close enough to town but not in the midst of the nightlife. Pool was so relaxing with great attentive bar service. Reception area is perfect and the staff go above and beyond to accommodate and arrange anything you need.Breakfast buffet is small but everything is wonderful, it's like your mom is cooking in the back and everything is brought out fresh including eggs, meats, cheese, yogurt, and plenty of coffee.Rooms are minimal with a nice balcony to watch the sunset. Beautiful view and very quiet even with the busy street outside. Only wish there would have been a hook or two to hang towels, etc. will definitely stay here again when we visit and highly recommend.",1
"I had an amazing stay at the Hermes Mykonos Hotel in Mykonos Town. I traveled solo staying 4 nights and found the location of the hotel perfect and accommodations outstanding. The staff was so nice and helpful. They even had superglue when I asked as my glasses broke 2 days into my stay. LOL! The views from the hotel were spectacular as the hotel was high up on the hill. I walked everywhere so it was quite a workout back and forth to town (always returned to the hotel drenched!) which was fine by me as I had no plans on hitting a gym while in Greece. But if you have mobility issues, it could be a challenge. So it was close enough to the action to enjoy but deal with noise and crowds. There was a bus stop across the street from the hotel which took you to the numerous beaches which was so convenient.They have a continental Greek breakfast which was tasty. The pool was fab with amazing views. The room was cozy and super clean. I would definitely stay here again if (I mean when) I return to Mykonos.",1
"Firstly it's spotless - and I'm mean super, super clean. Everything is in dazzling white and there is always someone mopping / dusting etc. Secondly the staff are lovely - super friendly and polite. They were some of the best I've experienced anywhere.We stayed in room 102 for 5 nights.Hotel arranged a free pick up and return from/to the airport - just had to send them an email in advance. Breakfast was included - perfectly adequate. Wifi was consistent in the room and communal areas (including pool) but didn't quite reach our balcony which was fine for me.Location wise - you get great views because you are fairly high up on the hill behind the town. It's not far, we timed it, and could get to taxi square in 10mins, coming back it was nearer to 15. Fabrika is the other way and takes a bit longer and the path isn't as nice. If you have mobility issues I wouldn't recommend it as the quickest way into town is via footpaths that contain a lot of steps / uneven surfaces and are in places a little steep. They also aren't that well lit at night but felt perfectly safe.My only niggles are around the bathroom (which was beautiful and had an excellent shower) - there is literally nowhere to hang your towel so it always ended up on the floor and had to be changed every day, and the glass walls (completely frosted so you can't see anything) between the bathroom and bedroom, as the bathroom window was right under a spotlight the bathroom was light at night, meaning the bedroom was light also due to the glass sections. For me it was just too light to sleep well, which is a shame as the bed and pillows were excellent. Happily stay here again however. Really lovely.",1
"I stayed at this hotel as a solo traveller for a total of 4 nights and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. In fact I have nothing negative to say about this hotel at all. The Hermes Mykonos is located about a 10 minute walk from Mykonos Town itself in an elevated position. This gives you some amazing views over both the sea and Mykonos. It was lovely each night to sit on your own balcony, have a wine and watch the sun go down into the sea. My room was well appointed, modern and pristine clean. Breakfast in the morning was good, typical continental style and staff serving were lovely. I loved the outlook of the pool area, which took in views over Mykonos. There is also a pool bar if you fancy a drink by the pool. All the staff I encountered were very helpful, organising transport or giving recommendations. If I came back to Mykonos I would be happy to stay here again.   Room Tip: I stayed in room 202 and it has fantastic views. See more room tips",1
"I loved my stay for two days here.beautiful view from the balcony.staff is couteous.the major drawback is that the veg breakfast is horrible.when i asked if they can saute some veg for me tgey refused flatly.Everthing has egg in it except the bread.There is tomato and cucumber so make yr own sandwich.Have juice,coffee and fruits.will recommend this hotel but veg people please carry your own foodstuff",1
"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Whatever you do, do not book this hotel! We booked our stay through Expedia for May 14-18,2016 in the garden view room. We found mold everywhere!!!! On the curtains, on the bed under the sheet, on the chairs. Literally anything with fabric had mold on it. We brought this up to the hotel which was willing to switch us to a different room but we were too grossed out to stay. We kindly asked for our money back, at least for the days we were not there for. There was miscommunication with the manager, in which we thought we were getting a refund but no such luck! She threatened to call the police and we are glad she did! The cops forced her to give us half our money back, as Greek law states. However, we completely lost 50% of our money. This was not our fault. There was mold everywhere in the room and that's completely unacceptable for a 4 star hotel.",2
"We stayed in the hotel for a week at the start of May. It was really fabulous and have nothing negative to say about Hermes Mykonos. The staff are incredible. They are all very helpful and cant be praised enough. In particular Manus who works in the Bar by the pool and is aptly nicknamed as Barmanus is incredible. He was so helpful and friendly and made the stay all the more positive. The hotel itself has recently refurbished and it shows. All the rooms are gorgeous, with top of the range bathrooms and showers and excellent hairdryer! The place is immaculate. It is a family run hotel and the breakfast is really good with a wide variety of food each morning, including gorgeous greek yogurt, pastries, fry-up etc. (The coffee is not great however). You can enjoy your breakfast, looking out over the bay of Mykonos town and it is like paradise. The only little down side is, it is not located directly in the town and is a walk from the town, either up a steep hill or vice versa. Tazis are not expensive though and the up side of being away from the town is you do not have the noise of hotels which are situated in the centre of town, which I have heard can become very noisy at nighttime. They also offer a free airport transfer each way. I would definitely return and you will not be disappointed if you pick this Hotel... I am hankering to go back already!",0
The views are amazing from this hotel. From the moment we walked into our room I felt completely relaxed. Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle of wine and watch the sunset while sipping away. The pool is also very nice with great service and delicious mojitos. The location is very convenient to walk in and out of the town however I would not recommend doing it in high heels.   Room Tip: Pick a sea view See more room tips,0
"I've stayed at the Hermes twice and loved it both times. The service is excellent and the views wonderful. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The pool is very nice and I love the elevated location. It's just a short ten-minute walk into town. I would definitely stay there again. The only drawback is the traffic just outside the hotel, you need to cross this road to walk into town. But this is minor. It's a beautiful hotel.",2
"Only and only stay at the room facing the sea side specially on the ground floor just above the garden or at the garden level, wooow the feeling of opening your balcony greeted by a majestic sight of the blue ocean with breeze on your face wooow again. the hotel is very tastefully done up with warm and courteous staff, very helpful and friendly and great in giving advice. the location is just 5 to 10 min from mykonos town by atv or transport which was perfect for us as we did not like to stay in a very crowded place. the atv renting place was suggested by the hotel which was walking distance very nice people. we were 2 couples rented atv and loved every bit of it. the the sun set views from the room the swimming pool is breathtaking and honestly beautiful would say one of the best as we went to the spot by the wind mills known for its sunset we preferred the view from the hotel.the rooms are clean and nice. only suggestion for the hotel would be to give a better breakfast in terms on variety was pretty much the same every day for 5 days.Apart from that would come back again for sure.   Room Tip: sea side rooms only See more room tips",3
"Great location, close to Chora town. About 15-20 minutes walk downhill into town Friendly and helpful staff. Lots of variety for breakfast. Beautiful pool and outdoor area, offering wonderful views. Would definitely return.",0
"Positives are the stunning views, friendly staff, good breakfasts and you are within (steep) walking distance of all the nightlife and fun of Mykonos Town.Negatives are that the rooms are on the small side, and overlook a busy and noisy main road (which is directly behind the pool). In hot weather (I visited in early Oct when it was only pleasantly warm) - this would be a shame as it detracts from the joy of sitting out on your balcony and watching the sunset - the views and sunsets from here are incredibly beautiful.",1
"Fantastic hotel, great views. The staff were all really friendly, very clean rooms and facilities. Highly recommend this hotel. Plenty of off street parking. Cool pool with loungers enjoy a Greek salad and beer by the pool. We will 100% return",0
"If you come to Mykonos, you have to stay here. The staff were ever helpful giving us tips to travel around. You can walk downhill from the hotel to the main Mykonos town although the walk back u is quite steep. We hired a car the 2nd day and it was very easy to drive around. The staff gave us plenty of tips on great places to eat and places to see. The views of Mykonos is amazing from the rooms and the pool area. One of my favorite places ever!   Room Tip: Get the rooms on a higher floor for better views See more room tips",0
"Great hotel in Mykonos above the main town with an awesome view of the sunset as we choose a sea view room. We travelled as group of four friends to Hermes Mykonos Hotel and were accommodated by the hotel at every request - picking us up from the airport, putting our rooms next to each other etc - We loved the hotel. The decor is very bright, airy and open and makes you feel totally relaxed. We had the pleasure of visiting Mykonos just after the busy season when things were starting to wind down but the staff were very friendly and the pool area and bar service was great. Mykonos is quite hilly in general and the hotel is situated above the main town. We didn't have any problems walking up and down but if you aren't great at walking I'd suggest picking a hotel more down the hill towards the town. We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends looking to visit Mykonos.   Room Tip: Choose a sea view room as they are higher up and offer a great view of the sunset. See more room tips",0
Very clean and very comfortable Waking distance to town 7 min and it's very easy to walk! We rented buggy for two days and we had a blast ! Room is clean with great view of the city u won't regret it Very friendly stuff and free pick up from and to ferry or airport witch is only 5 min drive but still helps that's u don't have to worry :)great breakfast as well !! We will stay agai,0
"The young girl who works the front desk is very helpful and friendly. The staff in general was great and happy to help us out with several different tourism needs. A decent uphill walk back to the hotel from Mykonos town. The only thing I ddin;t see in other reviews that surprised me was that when you are at the pool, or in your ""sea view"" room is that there are several powerlines in your line of sight, that aren't in the photos. That was a bummer. Also on the curve of a loud/major road, so there is some traffic noise. Overall, it's a great place to stay though. Breakfast was wonderful everyday.",0
"Great hotel, views from the city, clean, spotless, marble floors - everything white!Bed- very comfortable, breakfast buffet- yummy- staff very very nice. Great pool as well. Even the hotel cat Hermes is a sweety! Fantastic views of the sunset and the white housed city. My husband and I loved it!!!!!   Room Tip: choose the sea view room See more room tips",0
"i have been going to Mykonos every summer for the last 5 years . and this hotel is the one that i will recommend the least compare with my previous years experiences . the hotel is in an excellent location really close to Mykonos town. I arrived early in the morning and i was picked at the airport . My room was not ready but they arranged a lower quality room but i was pleased because i wanted to rest . the room is good size with a pretty standard Greek decoration, bed and pillows comfortable, AC perfect working condition but the rooms do not have a minibar and not even daily water is provided. small flat screen TV, modern bathroom. the quality of the breakfast is great and plenty but the staff interact very little with you. In this hotel is missing the typical Greek hospitality that i am used to. not welcome drink, no tricks in the rooms, not that friendly approach of the staff. the hotel does not provide a restaurant and the poolside menu is not that tasted. There is free wifi that works fine . the hotel pool is small. i think this hotel have a lot of run for improvement and even when is good i will not recommend it as my first option to stay in mykonos. check better ones like Andronikos Hotel and Rocabella Mykonos the 2 that i prefer right now",0
"Hermes Mykonos is amazing. This is our 2nd time back in two years. Everything is clean and the views are excellent.Location: 5 min away from the airport. 10 min walking down a maze into the town. Be prepared to get lost but all the roads funnel into the town so you will make it into town, it just might not be where you expected to end up. Google maps is a big help here.Rooms: clean, spacious and incredible views. Splurge for the terrace. it's worth it.Service: everyone is friendly!Breakfast: do not miss breakfast. I'm a frequent traveler and i can say that this breakfast hands down, is the best i've ever experienced. They have tables and chairs set up so you can eat while enjoying the view of the aegean sea. It's breathtaking. And the food is delicious!!!   Room Tip: splurge for the terrace facing the sea! See more room tips",0
"Stayed here two nights in a twin room with a friend. We received free transfer to and from the accommodation. Breakfast was fantastic with so many options and a great view over the town. Room was very clean, and cleaned to a great standard daily. Beds were very comfortable and the shower/bath was a dream. Staff were very friendly to point out some great restaurants, beaches to visit, and things to see. Walk to town was not bad but depends on your fitness and how hot it is on the way back. We visited in October so was very manageable. I highly recommend this stay!!",0
"My husband and I had a great stay. Breakfast was great with the view of the ocean from the breakfast room...We wanted to hire a buggy to cruise around the island. Hotel staff arranged that. 10 min walk to the city centre. Easy going down, wait till you do the walk up! We stayed at the sea view room.",1
"Pretty much everything about this hotel was spot on, including the high quality organic greek toiletries provided in the bathrooms. The pool, the views, the private balconies, etc. The only recommendation I would give to the hotel is to spruce up the breakfast lounge and offerings. (PS since it's outside the old town you can park your car / scooters easily here.)",0
"We stayed at Hermes for three nights. Overall the hotel had a sleek modern look with a white marble lobby and great room downstairs with water views and an open balcony for breakfast. We had a room with balcony and ocean view. The view was amazing, but the noise from mopeds and ATV's driving by on the street below was very loud which took away from the view to a certain extent. With the doors closed and inside the room the noise wasn't a problem though. They could use hooks in the rooms to hang things up and drawers to unpack if you want to (only to very small ones in closet). Loved the free transport to and from airport and ferry! Was surprised that there was no written info regarding things to do etc provided to guests or even a book in the room with written info about the hotel and it's offerings but people at desk helpful when asked for assistance. Mykonos Town and Little Venice were a hilly ten minute walk away.... Not too far, but far enough that you don't want to forget something in the room or bother going back for a 15 minute rest.I wouldn't bother staying here if you don't get a room with a view and would stay closer to town but if you get a room with a view it is worth it despite the street noise.",2
"The Hermes Mykonos Hotel is located in Chora-Downtown Mykonos town (one will have to walk to town about 10 min by foot), my room 201 faced incredible sea views, amenities were from Korres and air conditioning was good. Breakfast contained a lot of options and delicious eggs, and bacon. Hotel lobby is covered in white marble and white sofas. Pool area is nice, beautiful and frequent guests using. Free transfer from port-airport. Hotel is well maintained and staff take a lot of time to clean and make everything polished. if someone is unsure where to stay choose to stay in Mykonos Chora -town, that/s where all the activity occurs and super easy to get on city buses to go to Panormos, Psarrou and Super Paradise (Best organized beaches of Mykonos).I wish hotel could replace dark pink and burgundy curtains/wall treatments to a more contemporary color and neutral palette such as off white or fendi, or beige. Also would recommend the hotel staff act more gently indicating local choices, restaurants to go, how to get buses, they all seemed in a hurry although hotel was not so busy. They replied to all my requests but I felt they could be a little bit more welcoming. A little cumbersome on the way back from town (somewhat steep) . Hotel staff told me to use the short cut route but there were a lot of broken rocks and unstable soil and dark route with some scattered litter and mosquitoes. I took the main road that took me more 5 minutes but was safer on the way back. I wish some of the cosmetic changes to be done in interior design of the room and bathroom does not translate into increasing costs. Mykonos is an expensive island .   Room Tip: rooms facing sea views are amazing 201 See more room tips",0
"It's a decent hotel. Location was good, it's near enough to walk to mykonos town but far enough to be away from all the buzz in town. We also had a room with a sea view, which was good. Room service was quite exceptional, the staff there met each of our little demands with efficiency and a warm smile. The pool area was beautiful and really good for chilling. The breakfast spread was quite limited though. Overall, I think this is a charming and chillax hotel, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing holiday in Mykonos.",0
"We have been to Mykonos several times and return to this hotel every time. The staff are just wonderful, the view is the absolute best and the price is very reasonable. We will be staying here again when we return. Top floor rooms provide the best views.   Room Tip: Top floor rooms provide the best views with balconies, but lower floor rooms have larger verandas. See more room tips",0
Just had an amazing 4 night stay in Mykonos and this Hotel. The lobby was bright open and airy. The pool and the pool area was excellent and great service provided by Marnos. Front desk staff was very helpful especially Anna. Nice to be picked up at airport and dropped off at Port on our departure at not cost just a tip.Morning breakfast was plentiful and beautiful view from the room where its served.Our room was above the main reception area and we had incredible views ok Mykonos town and the sunsets from our little terrace. Beds were very comfortable and spacious bathroom. Only slight drawback was some traffic noise from street below but very quite at night and during the day you done't really notice it. Highly recommend staying here!,0
"Very clean, and great view from room. Staff were very good and understanding, I had a very relaxed time here! Pick up was no hassle from the airport, to and from. Hotel was within easy reach of town, and beaches.",0
"We enjoyed our stay at Hermes Hotel in Mykonos. The hotel is updated and clean, and the room was very comfortable. We received an upgrade to a sea view room, which we really enjoyed. Location had great views, which also meant a bit of a walk to get to town. Would definitely stay here again!",0
"The hotel is best fit for a short stay as there is not much to do in there. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel doesn't have much in terms of amenities, restaurants or food options...and that is why it is good for crashing in and planning for things outside of it",0
Just stayed at the Hermes for 5 days and was pleasantly surprised. Room was great with a veranda and ocean view. Breakfast was great and had new additions each day. The staff was amazing. Everyone was so accommodating and responsive. The pool and the bar have amazing views and provide a great setting for sunsets. The bar staff are both awesome ( not to mention cute as they can be). They were both so engaging and sweet that we had friends from other hotels stopping by for drinks because of them. They really added so much to the hotel experience. I hope they are there when we return.....and we WILL return!!,0
"We did stay 6 night and we love it there...the people were very nice. Beautiful hotel, nice pool...beautiful sunset view. Perfect location!!! We end up chosen a room outside the main lobby and it was great...private entrance to it and the room was much bigger but the only thing is that you don't get any ocean view which is was fine with us. I would definitely stay there again.",0
"Very nice hotel, lovely and clean. The room was really spacious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. To be honest I won't stay here again due to its location. It is a long walk back from the town to the hotel. Given the expensive rate of €300 per night in July, we weren't too happy. We are two young and fit adults but in the heat, the hill walk is seriously steep and we walked it four or five times during our stay, however, after a trip to the beach, shops, night out the walk was really off putting. As I said, it's very clean, quiet and the rooms are beautiful but the location is a problem. They collected us from the ferry and dropped us to the airport, which was great. As I already said, the staff are really lovely here.",2
"This is the second time I have stayed in the Hermes, time before was in 2009 and since then a few cosmetic changes have occurred for example the breakfast room is now downstairs in the hotel. We had a similar room with sea view which was excellent.The hotel is run by the same family who I recognised and they were very friendly. The breakfast range has certainly increased and is excellent and was much better than the other mykonos hotel we stayed in this year which was a more expensive one! The pool area in this hotel is somewhere you can spend a lot of time enjoying the suns rays , music and nice service of the young bar tender. Another excellent point to this hotel is the airport shuttle which since there are so few taxis on the island is a great benefit. There is a climb up to this hotel from the seafront but this gives you the benefits of an excellent view, an excuse to explore some of mykonos back streets, and a chance to burn off some much needed holiday calories. It doesn't take long either!I wouldn't say this hotel is luxury but it is definitely an extremely high standard with great service and I will definitely be considering it for our return trip to Mykonos.",4
"We are family of three people, we stayed 2 nights at the hotel.It met our expectations .Pros:-polite, professional staff/ fast check in&out-very clean room,bathroom-view of the sea from the room -diverse breakfast Cons:-wifi needs improvement !Note:Location was perfect for us (provided that you do not have any problem with stairs!),  15 min walking distance to chora(city center)",1
Great hotel you won't be disappointed.. We only stayed here for one night but would definitely return. Rooms are neat and tidy and great views.Nice pool area with bar.Bathroom pressure is great.Good wifi.Great buffet breakfast.Furniture could do with some updating but beds are comfy so can't really complain,1
"Overall, the experience is perfect, especially if you're looking for something quieter. While there were small miscues, like less-than perfect bathrooms and decently good service, this hotel is an overall excellent choice that is clean, well-run and close enough to the night life.GREAT view of the sunset on the balcony, though! Make sure to get the upgrade, it's just EUR15 per night (as of July 2015)   Room Tip: Get the upgrade to a higher floor See more room tips",0
"Great hotel, very accommodating staff throughout the hotel. Lovely view over the old town and port. Swimming pool - just the right temperature if you are considering this time of the year. Short walk done the hill to town, needed GPS as streets are a tad bewildering. Said to my wife don't ring me and tell me you are outside a white building with blue door (as they all are). Rooms are all you could wish for, assuming you don't want butler service. Nice balcony for Heineken and G & T's. Big fridge - so no hassles with bar fridge bulls..t. Stock it yourself.",0
"This was our 6th trip to Mykonos but our first stay in The Hermes after a recommendation from friends. It was a very good recommendation. We were met at the airport by a charming man and did not see our luggage again until it was delivered to our room. The marble floored reception area with white walls and sofas was so welcoming. Rooms are large, spotlessly clean and, at the front, have a wonderful view over the town and out to sea. We had a ground floor room with a large terrace where we were visited by the hotel cat ""Hermes"" who is as friendly as the rest of the hotel team. The room also had a large fridge which was great for storing water and other bits and pieces from the supermarket. The pool area is charming too and if there is a bit of traffic noise, you can easily block it out. The walk into town takes about 5 minutes but allow yourself double that to get back. It is steep. Just take your time and think of it as the price you pay for the view. Well worth it.What makes this place special is the the team here really seem to care about their guests. We have stayed in more expensive hotels in Mykonos but they honestly weren't any better. This is great value for money and a lovely place to stay.   Room Tip: The ground floor rooms are get less traffic noise and views across the lawn and out to sea. See more room tips",0
The rooms are just gorgeous all with a lovely view on both the ground and upper levels!!! Breakfast could be a little better for ( 5stars ) more variety and range possibly... The staff were great and great location very photogenic hotel!! It's is a bit away from the town but simple walking distance just going back is uphill for those not so uphill inclined ... I would prefer to stay here that in town close by and much nicer !!,0
The hotel is about 5 mins dive to the city centre..It has the most fantastic view of the sunset....spacious rooms with balcony...housekeeping could get a bit better but overall a lovely stay ..would recommend and stay here again.,0
"Hands down one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The setting is just stunning, and the design of the hotel is different, contemporay and tasteful. The service, on all levels is fantastic; consistent and personable yet professional. Will definitely go back.",0
"Somehow I accidentally submitted a review for the another myconian property. The review was mean for the utopia. Here it is...... My family had a wonderful 4-day stay at Utopia. The food was fantastic. The views unreal. The pool area was gorgeous. The staff goes out of its way to make sure you have a wonderful time. We had an early issue with our rooms, and the manager rectified it as soon as possible. If you enjoy hanging in the room and on your balcony, I highly recommend staying in the private pool rooms. It's a difference maker. It's quite an experience having your own infinity pool with the view. #705 for example was a wonderful room.",0
"One fo the most beautiful hotels we've been to... Amazing design, crazy views, very nice rooms, beautiful infinity pool, private beach closeby, pretty decent food, fancy pool bar, ...the personnel is really nice and friendly (special mention to Christina, Natalia, the restaurant hostess and the waiters)But, for the huge money you are paying for a suite, the hotel needs some improvments to make it to the next level:- rooms need some extra amenities (no space to put your shampoo and body gel in the shower, then you struggle to get them from the floor each time you need them - No space for your beauty products and bathroom stuff - extra TV channels wih sport or movies are welcomed - more space for a one week couple clothes...)- service needs some improvment as well: 3 days to get new pillows, some of the staff (room service) dont understand or speak english well then it happened that we asked for the same thing 3 times durign our in room breakfast, ...- The Gym needs some serious refurbishment, absolutely not in line with the hotel standards- For the money we were paying (above 700 euros per night), it's very unclassy and non professional to make us pay for water (outside 2 offered 50cl bottles)...- Wifi connection was crap, absolutely slow...- We mentioned we were traveling for our 5 years wedding anniversary while booking, no particular attention or present was waiting for us. Again, considering the kind of money you pay, you expect more... Overall a beautiful pleasant experience in a very nice environment, but many aspects need to be improved to make the value for money at this hotel matching...   Room Tip: No need to book a room with private pool or private jacuzzi, as you dont have time to enjoy them + n... See more room tips",0
"Arriving in Mykonos airport and meeting our hotel's transport to the hotel was smooth. The only thing is that we could have had a little more direction as to where we were going (we arrived first but was the last to get on the bus) and weren't sure when to get off the bus. (The shuttle van is for all the Myconian Hotels)When we arrived at Utopia, everything was fantastic. The hotel was beautiful. George, the hotel manager, was great and friendly. Check-in was smooth and we're taken around the hotel and shown to our room by Natalie. Natalie really made our stay the best! From booking our hotel dinner to helping us create an amazing day out to Nammos. Anything was possible! The hotel provides a shuttle from the hotel to Mykonos Town- which we found extremely helpful. We will definitely be back and will definitely stay much longer!   Room Tip: A room with a pool is great! See more room tips",0
"The hotel is near Elia beach which one of the nicest beaches of Mykonos. The hotel is on a hill, but the hotel has drivers who take you to the beach and buses to the city.The staff in the reception were very patient with us and helped us with all of our questions, gave great recommendations, and even helped me organize surprise for my girlfriend's birthday",0
"I stayed at The utopia for One week and just came back to Brasil where i live. The hotel is really very nice with a fantastic view, but The hotel manager is really horrible doesn't know how to lead with high standard customers and i have to say that The bus that brings The guests to The beach is never There and to go up and down from The beach it takes more or less 45 minutes. The swiming pool is fantastic and The waiters Mike more Than The others are very nice and cooperative and i have to say that also One of The concierge was very nice.. The rest was horrible. Will never go back and i surely recomend Belvedere hotel where iI've been several Times and never got disappointed.",1
"We only spent 3 nights at the Myconian Utopia Resort but felt like it was a week. What a fabulous place. Great staff, great room, great views. The resort is the smallest of the group but it's at the top of the hill and has such amazing views of the Aegean Sea. We stayed in a Heavenly Retreat room. We'd take advantage of the poolside bar service every day (food, drinks & snacks) and then get ready to take the shuttle service into Mykonos town by evening. This is very helpful as the resort is quite far from the Town (through some very steep and winding roads!!). You get bussed to another resort further down the hill but note that the bus does fill up. In fact on one night there were people standing up on the bus & that wouldn't have been very comfortable. Perhaps the resorts should consider running 2 buses at the busiest times. Breakfast is fantastic (also great gluten-free range). Internet connection was also very good from our room. Although it would have been handy to have had in room tea/coffee making facilities. We ate at the Resort's restaurant our last night and the food was absolutely delicious (scallops, crab risotto, beef fillet).We want to thank Andreas (Restaurant Mgr) and George (Resort Mgr) for making our stay so memorable. But a special mention of the outstanding service from George (also known as Joe). Nothing was ever too much trouble for him and he went above and beyond the call of duty. His friendliness, happiness and great attitude to life just added to our holiday vibe. Paradise found...well for me at least",0
"We just arrived home after 5 nights at Utopia. Had a great time. Nice staff, great service, great location, beautiful rooms and facilities. The food is great as well...can't think of any minus. Don't hesitate- Utopia.",0
"All I can say is you will completely regret if you don't trust the negative reviews on trip advisor about the Utopia. It was a horrific experience from check in to check out. For context, I am from NYC and stay at the Ritz and St. Regis whenever I travel. This hotel should be listed as a 3 star at best. CONS:1. the room you book will look NOTHING like the pictures you see on their site. When we nicely complained to the manager (George K.) he proceeded to YELL at us telling us that ""all hotels do this trick"" to photograph only the nicest rooms and post them in the wrong category. I could not believe my ears at this ""hospitality"" when we simply asked a question. Trust me - you will NOT get the room you see. If it says you'll get a bathtub overlooking the sea, you will simply not. You'll get a closet joke of a bathroom. 2. Most of the staff are pretentious and rude and they will sales pressure you to eat dinner at the hotel. They'll say you need a reservation to get in and it's empty every night because it's terrible. 3. You will constantly feel underdressed. Bring fancy clothes if you take the risk of staying at this awful establishment 4. The food is ATROCIOUSLY overpriced and not worth even close to what they charge. 5. Music is way too loud at the pool and every single person we saw there was a 50+ year old man with what looked like an 18 year old girl. We felt disgusted the entire time. Also, the chairs do not recline or incline at all so if you risk this hotel, hope you enjoy lying completely down when you're reading or eating. 5. The bathroom is a curtain about the size of an outhouse. It's awful. And do not travel here if you're a new couple because the toilet situation is embarrassing and awful (no fan/ventilation, no privacy whatsoever). 6. Staff are annoying about tips. They even ask you at check out to fill out a ""reception tip"". PROS: - the view is unreal. So is the view at every hotel on Elia beach. This is my first and hopefully last review on trip advisor. I'd be remiss if I didn't share my deplorable experience at the joke of an overpriced hotel.",3
We are staying at the Myconnian Imperial and fancied something new for lunch. The hotel transferred us to Utopia for lunch and we were not disappointed. The beach bar is very chic and serves a great lunch. Superb wine selection with epic wine glasses! A great range to choose from in a stunning setting.,0
"This is probably the best decorated hotel I have ever stayed in. Hotel is really beautiful, smells clean & nice and it is really clean.It is almost on the top of the hill so the view is breathtaking.Pool area is perfect, you will love it.They also provide free shuttle to Mykonos town several times a day what I really appreciated, we went to the town every day and this was very comfortable way to get there (plus it costs nothing).Check in/check out - very quick, smooth and proffesional.Staff very friendly, helpful and attentive.There are only three things that I did not like but I can still give this hotel five points because other things were amazing and I would definitely come back:1. Beach - this hotel would deserve a better beach- elia beach is not the best on island + their part of beach is crowded and does not look very ""attractive"", so we went to their beach just once (anyway another day we wanted to go to the pinky beach and hotel arranged for us a private transfer with mercedes and did not charge anything, so the quality of beach would not stop me from booking this hotel again plus pool area is great enough);2. Pillows - not very comfortable but I guess you can ask to change them3. Rooms - we stayed at a signature retreat room which some might consider too small which I must admit. The fact is that the room is ok, not too small but the bathroom is quite small with shower inside of the black toilet but you can still use bath instead of the shower so no problem at all.First day we stayed in the room that was on the lowest level and this type of room should be definitely cheaper as it does not have atmosphere of 5star hotel. So if you decide to book this hotel, book higher level of the room or make sure you will not get a room on the -1 floor. (The higher, the better)Still great experience, definitely worth visiting.",0
"My fiancee and I arrived on the 24th May 2016. We were met with smiles and a glass of prosecco. We were upgraded to a suite at the top of the complex with the most amazing views of the bay which made us feel so welcome. The staff are brilliant and knowledgeable about the town, beaches and where to eat and drink. They all are all so friendly and seem genuinely happy to help with anything. Special mention to Kostas as he is a true professional and so helpful, nothing is to much trouble. Food at the hotels was again really good. Great selection and prompt service. Breakfast was great. Lunch and dinner also really good quality. Cocktails at the bar are very well put together and made well. The place is kept very clean and tidy at all times. We will definitely be coming back again. It felt like home. Thank you for everything. Alex and Corrine.   Room Tip: Book a suite as the rooms are bigger and better. See more room tips",0
"This hotel by far is the best hotel i have ever been to ! The view is just amazing ! I stayed two nights only but i will definitely go back again.Me ans my husband got the private pool room and it was amazing, beautiful interior, super clean, staff are so friendly and helpful! The perfect getaway! And perfect honeymoon destination.All these pictures are taken by me of the beautiful private pool and amazing hotel view",0
"I can understand why some people give this hotel 5 stars. The beach and the pool are really nice; the service is also very good, the staff tries really hard; the breakfast, which is included in the price, is superb; all the facilities are impeccably kept. But ... the rooms are not good, the design is SUPER inconvenient. I've never been to a hotel or any bathroom for that matter that didn't have a toilet paper holder -- here, it's just placed on a stool; there's no shelf or even a hook to put a towel in the bathroom, I have no idea how the designer imagined people taking a shower -- there's no place to put a towel; there's no exhaust fan and the door is swinging so there's no privacy whatsoever. If you want to shave in the bathroom, it's impossible because there's a tiny light and all walls are black, so you don't see ANYTHING. In fact it's so dark in the bathroom that I was having a hard time figuring out which bottle is shampoo. The size of the bathroom is so tiny that you can't freely turn around. Our room was RIDICULOUSLY small, i literally had to jump over my suitcase to get to the bed, forget unpacking - there's barely any storage and the little chest that's there is impossible to open because it's blocked by my suitcase which cannot be placed anywhere else. Our room was the 'standard' size but I saw that some of the other rooms were bigger. So if you decide to go to this hotel which has a lot of positives, make sure to get a bigger type of the room.",4
"What a way to start a holiday; body draped across a poolside bed (the most comfortable poolside bed might I add) with the bay and sea views sprawling out in front, deep ambiatic mixes ebbing in the eardrums and champagne flowing...and flowing.This branch of the Myconian empire was termed the more 'relaxed/chilled' and comparing it to Avaton it definitely was. The interior is far more subdued, light cooler colours and refurbed pieces of driftwood litter the space...and hide a very cute little cat and kitten. If you were ever hungover, this would literally be Utopia.We had a room not far from the outdoor dining area and it was spacious, and full of quirky details; things dangling from above the bed, the bathtub by the window...by the bar, and the night-vision shower, all so odd but I loved it!For one night at Utopia it was absolutely perfect. Most important, I wish I could hug all the staff, they were just wonderful. Will I be back, damn right I will.",1
"We came for four days. The hotel is located at the top of the hill overlooking Elia beach. The staff are extremely nice and professional and will cater for all your needs. George and the other reception staff are amazing. One thing that bothered us : the breakfast is extremely poor and tasteless, the vegetables are poor and there is no selection of it. Everyday is the same breakfast and it tastes extremely oily. We thought that the breakfast in Greece would like any other Mediterranean breakfasts, rich and filled with taste. On the other hand the dinner is amazing is very tasty and the dishing is extremely beautiful. The pool area is amazing and the staff there cater for all your needs and wishes, everyone is so polite and nice. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, the facilities are fairly clean, but we would love if the room would be cleaned two times a day, morning and afternoon times. All and all i fully recommend this place, great location, great people, amazing view.",0
"Perched overlooking a beautiful body of ocean. This property is special and unique. An outstanding feature is the transportation that runs into and out of town every hour. A priceless amenity.The rooms are comfortable and beautiful. The pool and pool staff are incredibly accommodating and lovely. The lobby is decorated in a cool, hip vibe. Breakfast is fresh with many choices. Lunch is delicious also.Highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning again soon. 5 nights was not enough!",1
"What a fantastic hotel! We loved our stay here. The staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly - very well dressed too. We arrived by 9am and check-in wasn't until 3pm but they carried our bags down to the spa locker room so we could change. Then we had breakfast (the buffet selection is impressive and strawberry juice is delicious) and headed to nap by the pool.The pool is relaxing and the DJ plays from 11am on. The view is so spectacular it's almost hard to read! Drinks by the pool bar are good and the lunch is good as well. Everything in Mykonos is a little expensive. We ate lunch at the restaurant once, by the pool once and had dinner there. All meals were very good and I highly recommend the Greek salad. And Jor was often our waiter and we loved him! We would ask him all sorts of questions :)The restaurant manager and hotel managers are terrific. We decided to rent a car for two days which I highly recommend. We got lost a bunch but it's a great way to see the island and since there are only 30 taxis it's worth it. The manager sent us to two different beaches which were great and have us great recommendations for beach clubs - Nammos and Scorpios. I wish I could remember both gentlemen a names but we met so many people that I can't. There's a free shuttle that runs every hour into town from 6 pm to midnight. I would encourage anyone looking for a hotel to find one that does this. It's a 25 minute ride and the pick up and drop off was easy. Plus as I said taxis are few and far between and experience. There is also a shuttle that takes you down the mountian to the beach. Another plus since not all hotels are close to the beach.The rooms are very nice but I found them to be a little small. Maybe it was the room that we had. Especially the shower. There isn't much space for suitcase or clothes storage which is odd since most people are there for 5 days or more. We had a room with a pool and the view was fantastic but the pool was very salty and a little dirty so we didn't use it at all but it was great to sit and enjoy with a cocktail before dinner.The fitness center is tiny - one bike, one elliptical and one treadmill. I think that's typical since our hotel in Santorini had a similar set-up. I ran 3 mornings and was the only one in the gym. There's no wifi connection in the gym for some reason so make are you have music downloaded.Our stay was wonderful and everyone there made us feel very welcomed and special. I would most definitely go back!",0
"A 6-nights stay at this hotel was a part of our Honeymoon and we stayed in July 2015. The location of the hotel is very very nice with stunning views and it is for people that want to be in a quieter place, but again very close to the party options. We booked rent-a-car from the hotel so we can explore the beaches and Mykonos town which was 20 minutes away with the car.When we were checking-in we were warmly welcomed, we were introduced of some main facilities in the hotel and we were even upgraded to a better suite. The first thing you see are the great interior design in the hotel and the stunning views to Elia beach!We had bad luck because of a flooding in the upgraded room we were given, but the room we were moved to was amazing also. The food at the restaurant was very nice, my husband tried a steak for which he usually is very pretentious, but here he loved it. At breakfast there was nice variety, great service ( sometimes a little too much asking about dinner reservations but it was ok :D) and again very nice contemporary atmosphere.I must say the cocktails at the pool bar were awesome! The pool is amazing itself, as well as the music that was playing there the whole day.We also tried the spa center and a massage - again, nothing bad to say here, great relaxation and very nice massage!I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends, since we loved the atmosphere and the service as well!",0
"Came here for pre-dinner drinks and WOW, what a view! And the glasses the drinks come in are worth the trip alone! Great service too. We looked at the lunch and dinner menus - it's not cheap, but you could come for a salad for 20 euros or so. But definitely come even for a glass of rose (see photo!) - it was only 9 euros and it was really worth it.",0
"We stayed for one week in this hotel. according to the tripadvisor feedbacks it supposed to be a fantastic hotel. yet, it is nice but with some negativ points. First the positiv thing about the hotel: it is located up the hill with a beautiful view and looks very stylish. As we arrived arount 12 o'clock we were informed, that our room will be ready in one hour. As we got our room it was 2 o'clock, that was no so bad, because we changed and used the pool area. the room was very nice with a small privat pool.The service at the pool bar and restaurand was very good and the staff was very friendly. Food and beverages were also good.NOW THE negativ thing: all day long there was music playing everywhere and a way too loud! at the pool, in the restaurant inside and outside. After a while you really got a headache....you could hardly talk to each other! The second day we talked to an employe and he was very surprised that somebody complained about the music. So nothing happend...the DJ loved his music more than the guests, it seemed to us.After this talk we noticed, that some of the employes were no so friendly anymore (you can say rude) and they let us feel that we do not fit into this stylish hotel. when we checked out, we sayed it again and one of the statement was, that mykonos is a party island and the guests of the utopia hotel want to have such loud music. But if you read some other tripadvisor feedbacks you will notice, that we are not the only ones who did not like the loud music.By the way, I work for a travel agency and i will not recommend this hotel to every of my clients.   Room Tip: Room far away from the pool bar See more room tips",4
"Of all the hotels we stayed at while in Greece, Utopia was our favorite. It's an amazing hotel. The staff is incredible. The rooms are huge, well decorated, and have amazing views. We ate at the restaurant several times, which was delicious. Our favorite part was hanging by the pool. Nothing beats that view!",0
"The Utopia is part of a single group of hotels on a hillside location above Elia. The good - - you can use all the facilities of the other hotels if you need a change of scene- there is a constant shuttle bus service ferrying you between them, or to the private beach down below, or into town (about a 20 minute ride away).- excellent bar staff - friendly, attentive and nothing too much trouble- very good breakfast spread- stunning views over Elia bay- very cool decor within the roomsHowever- some of the decor almost too cool - ie dark tiles in the bathroom meant you could barely see- the staff on the front desk were variable - some incredibly helpful and smiley, others less so- you are a good 20 minutes away from the main town. You could see that as a good or a bad thing - but worth being aware of- DJ around the pool was awful - he needs to update his collection- you could almost be anywhere. Yes this is a very nice luxury hotel with great views but if you want a real taste of Greece and the islands, not sure this would be my first pick.",2
"This resort is one of the half a dozen Myconian Collection resorts on Mykonos. It is perched near the top of the ridge overlooking Elia Beach, with two other sister resorts sitting below it. Much thought is evident in its design and its ambience, with a general theme of driftwood evident from its entrance and throughout the resort. The service is blazingly efficient and courteous with the reception staff reminding me of the priestesses at Delphi. The rooms are modern and the outlook over the bay at Elia quite panoramic. The rooms had stand alone baths in the large bedroom, with two separate basin area and a rain shower. The beds were very comfortable. The resort serves an excellent buffet breakfast with a great range of gluten free options as well. The wait staff are attentive and efficient. While it is 20 minutes away from the old town at Mykonos there is a good shuttle service. We would happily stay here again.",0
"I don't know where to start. We loved this place from start to finish and I was actually sad to leave to continue my journey on to Santorini. We stayed at the Utopia at the end of May so it wasn't packed yet which was nice. The staff from the start was fantastic, we didn't meet one person who wasn't pleasant. We met the manager, Kostas, early in our trip. Seriously, we loved him and my husband I joke about my mini-crush. He was so pleasant and always checked in to see how you were enjoying your stay and if there was anything he could do to assist. My husband and I had a drink with him on our last night and had a wonderful time. We had lots of stories and he's hysterical. Hey Kostas - how do you cook you fish?!Another gem person is the food manager (I can't recall his name) of all of the Myconian Collection hotels. He too was fantastic and funny. We met him while eating in the Myconian Imperial (per the suggestion of Kostas). Very generous man and a delight to talk with. Other staff including the front desk, waiters, waitresses, bartender, etc. were all phenomenal.A huge perk of this place is the bus that takes you into town each evening. You never have to worry about a taxi unless you plan on staying past midnight. It's very comfortable and so convenient. They also have transportation down to the local beach, Elia Beach in which there is a segregated part of the beach for the hotel collection. They have a small amount of food and beverage service which was nice.Our room was lovely, very open and had its own pool. We didn't get much use out of the pool as it was too cold (not heated at this time of year) but it was nice to have. The only negative about the room as some others have mentioned is that the shower/toilet area is very crowded. There's one door that's shared to close off the toilet and the shower. Not a huge deal as you aren't spending a lot of your time in there but was the only negative we encountered. This space could have been bigger and also had some shelves in the shower. Breakfast was the normal European breakfast with cold cuts, cereals, eggs, etc. Note that they will make you an omelet or crepe if you ask. The champagne at breakfast was lovely also! We had lunch there our first day which was good and never had the opportunity to have dinner there.In summary, we highly recommend this hotel. I don't see how you could be disappointed. Kostas and his staff will treat you right. Kostas if you every come to the east coast in the U.S., don't forget to look up your friends Kevin and Heather in Pennsylvania! Thanks to you and all of your staff for the amazing experience!",1
"The name ""Utopia"" is very fitting for this hotel which is perched on the top of the hill and has an incredible view. We had the most amazing time here. The hotel is superbly decorated and the staff are very friendly and attentive. The food was very good and I really enjoyed eating on the patio looking out at the view. We also enjoyed the pools at the other properties which are just as spectacular. The owner of the Mykonian hotels seemed to be very involved in every aspect and I noticed he was making sure everything was running smoothly. There are shuttles available for transport so you don't have to hike up or down. Once in a lifetime experience for us!",0
"This is first review I have written regarding a stay at any hotel, the reason I am doing this is to highlight this hotel as one of the best we have stayed in and really to give recognition to the staff that we met during our stay. Our friends booked this for my husbands 40th birthday present - what a present !!! Yes we have truly wonderful friends :-) We were welcomed with a glass of fizz and greeted by the Manager Costas, we were made to feel really welcome and he took the time to show us around the hotel and explaining what was on offer and although this may be his job to do his passion and sincerity were plain to see. I feel that the service and attention to detail which he provides is second to none, from greeting us at breakfast and having a drink with us in the evening and even sorting out a speed boat to take us to Yammas Beach - what a great guy and thank you so much for looking after us all!!This hotel is understated yet beautifully stylish with its earthy and naturalistic decor and situated with a vista to die for. Our room was spacious and well designed with balcony views like a large dose of doctors medication! I loved when any of the staff were told why we were there they made a really big deal that it was my husbands birthday from the saxophone player coming to our table at the end of our first nights dinner in the restaurant to the small things they did during the day. In all honesty the staff really make this place, they are warm and friendly and up for a laugh and extremely attentive - if you don't have a laugh here then to be honest you are just a miserable person !! Janis - Cocktail in a face of your face !! Provided us with the best cocktails EVER, this guy really knows his stuff simply bliss...thank you and we miss them :) off the booze for a while now though!George - keep loving life, you are the type of person that even on the hangover days you still made us smile as his smile happiness was a tonic Antonia - thanks for your poolside grace, 1st class!Stelios - Lovely guy and keep up your excellent hospitable natural presence!From what we experienced in our stay at the Utopia we would highly recommend people to visit, granted there are fancier places around the world with more exclusivity but this isn't the place to stay for that, its a place to relax or get messy! YOUR HOME IS MY HOME! Thank you ALL you guys at Utopia you are truly a credit to the hotel and yourselves, no doubt we will see you again! KEEP SMILING love Crystal & Paul XX",0
"When my Mother and I left magical Santorini, I truly felt somber. BUT Myconian Utopia Resort QUICKLY upgraded my melancholy to pure bliss. This boutique resort will leave you breathless. Upon arrival in Mykonos, one of the resort's mercedes vans drove us to Elia - about 20 minutes away from the bustle of Mykonos Town to a private beach where the Myconian family of resorts glisten against the Agean. At the very top of the mountain sits Utopia. You know you've arrived someplace special when you're greeted with sparkling prosecco and seated on 8 thousand dollar glass ""stools"" as you fill out the guest forms. No boring reception area here! We were promptly greeted by Costas, the most pleasant (and funny!) hotel manager I've ever met. He gave us a lovely tour of the exquisite restaurant, infinity pool, bar, and spa before taking us to our room, a lovely suite with an ocean view. Speechless. Before we could say, ""Oh, My God""...a birthday cake arrived further affirming that we had not only arrived at an elegant hotel, but a guest-oriented resort that makes you feel like family. Breakfasts were fit for a greek god, and gourmet dinners by candlelight, by the sea..what more can one ask for? Much more in fact. The spa is heavenly and worth the splurge! Buy the products to remind you of the experience upon returning home. A driver is always available to take you to the other properties, where you are welcome to enjoy any facility or restaurant during your stay. But if you MUST leave the property- which of course you should visit Mykonos Town - guests are transported hourly in the afternoon and back to the hotel until past midnight. An evening cocktail at the bar is a special treat. Talented mixologists will create a luscious cocktail while you enjoy the chill-out grooves and chat with other guests. The staff is beyond superb. I miss them all! They really did feel like family...Mary, George, Yiannis, ""Ms Georgia""...and more... all gave us memories that will last a lifetime. You will feel like royalty after staying at Utopia. Thank you for making our Mother's Day/Birthday trip of 2016 simply spectacular.   Room Tip: Some are closer to the bar and DJ... but it didn't bother us during non-peak season. See more room tips",0
"It was our honeymoon and it was really just amazing. The hotel has a pure and cosmoplitan design. Each and every details is well thought through and the style is just consequent implemented. The location is perfect, you will have a perfect view of the sea. And a hotel free shuttle brings you to Mykonos town in 20min. The shuttle will drive every hour and pick you up in Mykonos town as well and bring you safe home. The pool area is cosy and hip at once. The breakfast is just delicious and the choice is huge. Also the dinner is excellent. The Staff is so friendly and polite. You will have the feeling it's your greek family. Check it out, it's just fabulous. We will come back, that's for sure.   Room Tip: 754 a great honeymoon suite! See more room tips",2
"From the perfect views to the incredible staff, my husband and I had an amazing holiday at this resort and will definitely be back!The room was very comfortable and great size with the most beautiful view of the sea.The champagne buffet breakfast included a wide variety of foods and everything was so tasty.We did dinner one night at the Utopia Resort and the restaurant and the service was top notch.I must make a special mention to the guest relations manager who was so very helpful in telling us places for us to visit in town and all of this recommendations were spot on. You can see he thoroughly enjoys what he does.The bartenders all make amazing cocktails for days when you just want to chill by the pool and enjoy the views.This hotel is about 20 mins by taxi to town so it's in a secluded idyllic spot and away from the hustle and bustle. We had an incredible stay- thank you Myconian Utopia.",1
"Hotel was beautiful, staff was awesome. Had an incredible stay and have already sent two good friends there and are spreading the word about this awesome gem to all of our friends and family. Can't wait to come back.",1
"Everything was perfect since we arrived here. We had a nice and warm greeting, including two glasses of champagne. We had a wonderful, spacious room with a great view to the sea and infinity pool. The breakfast, and everything from the restaurant was also excellent. You may choose from a wide variety of foods, and never fail your tastes.We were there with the occasion of our 6th anniversary and the hotel staff made us a nice surprise ( we had no clue about it ).Overall we recommend this hotel to everyone going to Mykonos. It's simply perfect!   Room Tip: The rooms with sea views are amazing See more room tips",1
"Nice eye catchy hotel.... However the basics are really missing....bad pillows... Bad mattress.... We had problems with the ad the entire stay.... Staff is however pleasant at the reception.... Nice welcome... The ""champagne"" breakfast has nothing exceptional... And no local food... Very standard....a resort hotel that stops breakfast serving at 10.30..... But then they serve lunch from noon til 7pm !!!??? They have a major work going on at the driveway... You would except that with the season starting this would have been done. ... No good TV channels...only Greek channels... We were super disappointed... Shuttle to Mykonos takes 25mns... First trip starts at 2pm.... Then again it starts at 6pm.... Prices of the spa quite on the high side too.... Would not recommend...",1
"Absolute perfection: the panoramic view, the location, the suite, decoration, incredible hospitality and care of every small details, as if they knew you in person were about to come, which language you speak and what you like. We had a wonderful time, delightful cuisine and even enjoyed a wonderful evening with Greek music and dancing on the balcony. A unique place for a fabulous vacation, highly recommended.",1
Had an amazing time here. From the moment you arrive the staff is there to welcome you and provide anything you need. Hotel is beautiful and the view is unmatched. Every amenity is top shelf and you feel as if you're on the island alone at times. Great hotel to stay.,2
"Spent three days vacation with my wife and had a really superb stay. The hotel looks brand new as it opened just three years ago and is very well entertained. It is located on the side of a hill with a stunning view over Elia's Beach. Rooms are distributed along the hill side and are accessible through small and glamorous paths that resemble downtown Mykonos. Our room was very large, with a very nice bathroom and a wonderful terrace and private swimming pool. A real luxury.During our stay we enjoyed the Spa and the very professional treatments. I also used the gym facility which has a wonderful view on the bay.Excellent breakfast, with a large selection of salted and sweet food as well as plenty of fruits.Very kind staff, recognises you and makes you feel very well cared about.",1
"<U+25E6> Came here on the 11th may, for one week, it was absolutely amazing, best holiday ever, the hotel Utopia is just beautiful, we stayed in a double deluxe sea view room with outdoor jacuzzi , it was stunning, house cleaning was brilliant , room cleaned every day sometimes twice a day, always smelt clean and fresh, the view from our room was just breath taking. Breakfast was just wonderful, and the staff are so friendly, attentive and so efficient, the meeter and greeter Mary is just beautiful , she seats you with a smile everyday day, makes you feel welcome and is so friendly¦<U+FE0F>thank you Mary. The outside pool is beautiful and the veiw is just amazing, the staff where just so lovely, big thank you to Dimetrius, Antonia, Mike, Giannis, and everyone else, for looking after us so well, also thank you to DJ Lev for the great music. The food here is just Outstanding , every meal was just delicious . Hoping to go back in September, can't wait, what more can I say, this hotel is heaven on earth, Utopia¦<U+FE0F>xx",2
"Possibly the most beautiful boutique hotel on Mykonos today ,but we were very disappointed with out stay .The room we had was quite small and badly lit The mattress wasn't comfortable but the worst was the shower inside the toilet.Inside the shower there is no place to move ,no soap or Shampoo holder and you have the choice of water from the shower head from the ceiling or holding the shower hose .If you decide to stay here the more deluxe rooms are better ,but a lot of the rooms have the shower in the toilet . As much as its beautiful the hotel isn't comfortable the staff don't spoil you and it doesn't really feel like a relais & chateaux hotel.",2
"Everyone was so polite and welcoming and made us feel at home as soon as we got there right up until the point that we left. Mary, the lady who greeted us at meal time was especially lovely. She always had a smile on her face and always said good morning/ afternoon without fail when seeing us. Everyone makes the effort to come and talk to you and we made friends with the staff which made the trip 2000% more enjoyable for us. Would recommend the Myconian Utopia resort to anyone in a heartbeat! No matter what the occation!",0
"We were staying in a nearby hotel with an already fantastic restaurant, but trip advisor reviews made us want to try Utopia Restaurant for dinner one night, as we wanted places to recommend to wedding guests next year.On arrival the reception staff greeted us in a friendly manner and took us to the Hostess to show us our table for dinner. The hostess came across very rude and impatient, and when we explained that we couldn't provide us with a room number as we were not staying in their hotel, she gave a rather snap response back of ""I just need a name to check you in for dinner""... Had she asked us for a name and not a room number, we would had provided her with this.Dinner was fine, our waiter George was very friendly. The atmosphere isn't the typical relaxed Greek atmosphere, and almost tries to hard to impress, if you like that kind of thing. Food wasn't overly impressive but nice enough. At least it was reasonably priced. On leaving, we asked the Hostess if she could call a taxi to take us back to the hotel, which she coldly responded with ""you can do it yourself at reception"". Not exactly 5* experience and when we complained to the manager in charge, he didn't seem too bothered.Overall an average experience, which certainly won't be recommended to the 100 guests of ours.",1
"Everything about this hotel oozes quality. The location is breathtaking, the staff and service are first class and the standard of food and beverages is second to none. Picture relaxing by an infinity pool, sipping a cool freshly mixed cocktail whilst tapping your feet to a chill out tune in the most awesome and luxurious surroundings that you can imagine. This is Myconian Utopia - need I say any more?",0
"The entire Utopia experience was spectacular. The staff, decor, rooms, amenities, and food were all far beyond expectation. The staff always made sure we had everything we needed and even helped us navigate around the town of Mykonos. We ate in the on-site restaurant during the first night of our stay and it was the best meal that we had while staying in Mykonos. We've only been gone from the hotel for a few days but would have stayed much longer if we could have!",0
"From the morning we arrived at Utopia we were greeted by a very welcoming staff who not only upgraded our room but let us check in early (as our flight came in very early). From the appearance to the staff to the food this place really deserves five stars and nothing less. Gianni's, George, and Kostas as the managers are fantastic- truly there for you for anything you should desire and their teamwork is one that really demonstrates not only great workmanship but friendship among them. As far as staff goes, Vivian, Michalis, John and Tanya were always around to not only make sure we had everything we needed but were so personable it felt as if we had brought our good friends along on the trip! Really could not have asked for a better stay and you would be doing yourself a disfavour choosing otherwise!! PS ask Kostas for a DFDB.. or two. It will change your life. With lots of love,Natalia & Daniel ;)",1
"I am not usually one to write reviews but I just had to share my experience with everyone. Me and my partner visited Mykonos this year (May 2016) and stayed at the Utopia resort. From the very moment we walked in, the fantastic service started. The reception staff greeted us (every singe one even the ones that were not attending to us) we were given glasses of prosecco while we checked in. The manager Costas was incredible, very polite, informative and genuinely a lovely person. All the staff at the hotel were actually great, not a bad word to say about any of them, they always spoke to us - stopped whatever they were doing to greet us. The views are our of this world, the hotel is located high up (on mountains like) so you can just imagine the views your going to get. The rooms and hotel overall is very modern and stylish. Normally I do not eat the hotel food, but the food here was beautiful, well presented and a variety of meals to choose from. This is definitely more than a 5* hotel! We are already planning our next trip back!   Room Tip: sea view rooms have an incredible view See more room tips",0
This is an excellent hotel to stay in while in Mykonos! My friends and I went for a holiday trip and couldn't have asked for a better stay. The interior of utopia is very fascinating and intriguing. The staff there is absolutely wonderful and is always there when you need them. There is also Elia beach right next to the hotel and the hotel provides transportation to the beach. There is also transportation into town. I highly recommend staying in this hotel! You will not regret it!,1
"I and my friend stayed for 3 nights at Utopia. Unitially, we booked Royal Mykonian Hotel which is a part of Mykonian Collection Hotels; however, it was due to ongoing renovation, once we got there they gave us better and nicer service of the upgraded room type with top floor. Cleaning staff come to check if any new towels needed or any others twice in a day. We had pleasant stay qt each night. Though the weather was still not too hot yet to enjoy all day sun bathing, we enjoyed taking great ocean photo from the infinity pool. For beach, we visited the nearest beach which is less than 5mins by a shuttle bus, and they have own reserved beach beds with parasol. We had massage also by the lady name Sunny, she was decent and professional in Chinese massage. Foot massage 30mins 30euro.Its about 20minutes away from the central mykonos town, however they have a shuttle bus every 1to2 hours so we had no problem of transfer. Every staff member is very professional and they were so friendly and kind that we felt so special.Highly recommend everyone to stay.",1
"My husband & I are currently staying in the resort in room 702. I honestly cannot fault the resort. We have been thoroughly looked after from the moment we arrived to the resort. The hotel manager is a delight, he is always visible to the guests, greeting them throughout the day, making sure everyone has slept well and are enjoying themselves. He has the warmest approach and told us 'this is your home away from home'. I have never felt so welcomed in a hotel before. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive, the rooms are perfect, the morning breakfast is delicious with lots of variety and the views are out of this world! You will feel completely relaxed and detached from everything. I highly recommend renting a car or a quad bike and visiting the different beaches away from Elia too. The hotel provides a shuttle bus which goes into the town throughout the day. Mykonos is beautiful and I cannot recommend this resort more. We're really looking forward to our massages and thalassotherapy in the spa this afternoon. We are visiting at a off-peak season so the resort is a bit quiet but if it was peak season there aren't enough sunbeds by the pool, so I would recommend catching one early in the morning. Nevertheless, I'm blown away. I never want to leave. Thank you Utopia!",0
"When it comes to getting the wow factor in the island of Mykonos, it doesn't get any better than the Myconian Utopia experience.Perched on top of a steep hill overlooking Elia Beach, the Utopia is part of a complex of 4 hotels including Imperial, Avaton and Villa. Utopia is located right at the top of the hill and the drive up is an experience in itself as the road is rather steep, however you will be fine as long as keep driving in first gear. On arrival, you will be greeted at the reception desk right by the entrance and presented with a glass of bubbly while the lovely staff checks you in. The whole process was very pleasant and speedy and we were escorted to our room relatively quickly while our luggage was being taken up by concierge.Our room located on the third floor was absolutely lovely - as the hotel is inspired by nature, all rooms feature nature inspired decor with black to dark brown tones. This makes up for a really warm, welcoming and soothing experience. The greatest selling point of the rooms at the Utopia is certainly the view. All rooms have fantastic all round views of Elia beach bay and I can certainly say waking up to that view on a bright sunny day is a reason in itself to go visit Mykonos. Beds were very comfortable and the fully functional air conditioning ensure the right temperature in the room. On a slightly negative note, the bathroom was small: so small in fact that it was difficult to move in it! Shower was decent but I noticed hot water was a bit of a hit and miss. Perhaps it was just our room! Also there was some exposed cabling near the sink which wasn't entirely safe in my opinion.Perhaps the biggest issue with these otherwise lovely rooms is the noise. I believe any two rooms in this resort are connecting and separated by sliding doors which are obviously locked unless you are taking over the two rooms. These doors however provide zero sound proofing meaning you can hear absolutely everything that's going on in the other room. We were unfortunate enough to have an extremely loud American group next to us meaning we would get woken up at 8 AM in the morning by the noise of their conversations or the TV. This is something management should really pick up on as it is a really easy issue to address.Breakfast is served daily in the hotel restaurant located on the ground floor. There's both indoor and outdoor space and one can decide whether to stay in or eat on the outdoor terrace. View is breath taking indeed however space is limited so at peak times you might have to queue before you get seated. We didn't have any lunch or dinner at the hotel however quality of breakfast food was superb. Make sure you try the Greek yogurt and honey which is simply the best thing Greece blessed the world with! Right next to the restaurant there is a stunning infinity pool and an outdoor bar where you can have drinks, cocktails, etc. Weather wasn't great when we went therefore we couldn't really try any of that.The hotel also have a small gym, which is really too small with just one treadmill and limited weights but it will do for a short stay. If you haven't hired a car for your stay in Mykonos fear not! The hotel offers complimentary shuttles between all its properties and the main village with the last leaving town at 00:30. I would however recommend hiring a car whilst in the island to enjoy the magnificent sights. While on the subject of driving, we were really surprised that the hotel is not signposted on the main road. When we pointed this out, we were told road signs are illegal in Mykonos as the administration is trying to preserve the natural beauty of the island. Not sure if that's accurate, however a few more signs would really help locating this property. Please don't trust a sat nav as it will take you off road on a really rocky road where we were unfortunate enough to get a puncture and breakdown! Instead just follow the signs to Elia beach and the hotel is located right next to it.All in all the Utopia is a fantastic place to be. There are a few things to tweak for sure, but I would still give it 5* because it's beautiful and we had an amazing time there. I would definitely recommend it for your dream holiday!",1
"The Myconian Utopia Resort is a beautiful property with five star service. This property is away from the tourist and party scene of Mykonos. The restaurant on property has a five star menu and the breakfast is spectacular with fresh fruit, made to order omelets, mimosas, and breath taking views. I would contact the concierge prior to your stay and they will arrange transportation to and from the airport or marina.",0
"My husband and I traveled to Greece for 2 weeks for our honeymoon back in July 2014 and oh boy do we want to come back! A wonderful thing happened while we were staying here. We had a honeymoon baby girl 9 months after we came home from our trip! I could ask for a more perfect setting and time for this to all happen! Utopia best describes this place. We are also big ""foodies"" and have always ate well while traveling. This resort offered far some of the best dishes we have had. The scenery was extravagant and breath taking. The service was PERFECT. The complementary shuttle bus would take us into town everyday and we splurged weather it was dining out or activities. Overall, the experience was well worth it and we definitely plan to come back.   Room Tip: This resort is up high on a hill, higher room would be preferable if privacy could be an issue See more room tips",2
"My wife and I were here in October 2015 for a week! It was absolutely amazing! There are three Myconian Hotels in this area of Elia beach which guests can venture into each bar and restaurant.They have a shuttle service which picked us up from airport and transported up to the the resort. This same shuttle will transport guests into town at regular intervals which we used on several occasions, including a late night sea side dinner.The hotel is a blend of the traditional white washed walls mixed with modern amenities and finishings. An elegant blend of modern and old world styles which definitely add to the spectacular view of the sea.The staff with first rate. Constantino the manager was incredible and went to his work effortlessly! If you are looking for something a little different ask for Nikos at the main bar by the pool who made me several customized drinks that he mixed himself without a receipt. Wow!A ""slight"" walk downhill to the private hotel beach which was incredible! There is a shuttle that will take you back to the hotel but we chose to walk a few times...I enjoyed the walk but it was a little taxing. Pick this spot and you will not be disappointed! A jem!   Room Tip: Incredible views See more room tips",1
"A true rhapsody in blue & white , where the local traditional architecture meets the best of contemporary design , the Myconian Utopia is , without doubt , one of the best option for those looking for days of fun in this gorgeous Greek island .  Located above Elia Beach , this property is famed for offering the best views in Mykonos not only from the common areas but also from all rooms and suites .  Facilities range from complimentary private beach space and bus services to town as well as a beautiful spa and an amazing Infinity pool where fashionistas get together to sample the cocktails and enjoy the DJ'a tunes at the pool lounge which appears as if suspended over the sea .  Breakfast is another perfect affair . Great variety ( incl champagne ) and excellent service to match . Well done .  Why not 5 stars ????? Unfortunately the rooms are very noisy ... We were a group of 8 and had 4 rooms located in different parts of the hotel . They all offered a good size and incredible views but one could also hear everything next door and in some rooms there are no division of the balconies ( sometimes you have to enjoy your private balcony literary next to the jacuzzi next door without any separation . Another weak point is the fact the the transfers to town are in huge buses shared with other hotels in the complex .  Would I go back ???? Most definitely YES. It is a very good product and only needs a few adjustments to be a solid 5 stars .",5
We spent 5 days here and it is truly a special place. It is beautiful location but the service is what makes it a great destination for a special occasion. Costas the general manager is hands on with his guests making sure they have all the comforts that they need for a perfect vacation. It is truly at least for us a once in a lifetime indulgence that is so worth it.,1
"There is beautiful view, delicious international food, nice service and unusual architecture! Myconian Utopia Resort is the best place on Mykonos Island. I highly recommend on trips with friends and family.",1
"A wonderful view with some great food and drinks, plus a fantastic service. A must on your bucket list! Thanks you Kostas, the property manager m, for taking us to the outdoor bar after our fantastic dinner. The mixologist will make you one of the best drink you ever had. Don't miss this place if you're in Mykonos. Thank you Kostas!",1
"The Utopia Resort is one of the best spots I ever was lucky to spend some vacation time in. From the nicely designed rooms with a great view over elia beach and bay to the infinity pool that overlooks the seaside, from the fantastic restaurant to the very attentive and skilled bar crew.The staff was friendly and always aiming to make your stay even better. Daily trips to Mykonos town are organised with a modern air conditioned bus, trips to the beach (5min walk downhill) are shortened with a driver on standby. Flawless food and drink service on the separate hotel section of elia beach. All in all, a truly remarkable place to stay and definitely the best one out of the whole resort group at elia beach.And on top you get a manager with salon quality hair. Every single day.",0
"I loved this hotel - the styling was all so cool - yet the service was spot on without any attitude. I stayed as part of a group so I saw several different room types and they were all amazing and all had the unique Utopian styling. The food at the restaurant was great and not overpriced. The infinity edge pool looks over one of the best views you will see. I would recommend it for couples or young, or young at heart singles who want a 5 star experience to relax in the day before clubbing at night. I loved the DJ who played by the pool from about midday everyday. This is one of my favorite hotels ever.   Room Tip: If you can afford to upgrade the suites are amazing See more room tips",0
"My friends & I were in Greece to celebrate our 40th birthdays. Our stay at the Utopia was nothing short of amazing. Yes it is remote like one of the reviews said but the 20 minute ride into town on the bus that runs hourly isn't too bad. The daily breakfast was great with champagne and mimosas. the service was top notch. Our suite had stunning views of the sea.Huge thanks to Mary, Mike and Kosta for making our time at the Utopia unforgettable!",0
"I stayed here for a week with my girlfriend in mid September. The hotel really has the wow factor the pool is stunning with an amazing view out to the Aegean sea. We stayed in a standard double room which was more than big enough for us, it was perfect. The grounds and rooms of the hotel are all very clean and tidy. The maid service is twice a day. Breakfast was great and there was always plenty of choice. We also ate in the restaurant in the evening on two occasions and had probably the best two meals we had in Mykonos there.The hotel is a out of the way of the hustle and bustle of Mykonos Town but this is exactly what we wanted. The Myconian resort put on a free luxury bus that takes you too and from the town every hour which was great. Busses were always on time too. We went into town 4 of our 7 nights and ate at some great restaurants. Scorpios and Mamalouka stand out for me.What really makes this hotel is without a doubt is the staff. They are so welcoming and attentive. It really is a very personal service as its the same members off staff all day every day. They work really hard. I would recommend this hotel to anyone ! We loved our time there are would return in a shot. One thing to note Mykonos isn't cheap whilst you are there. Its up there with Ibiza, Dubai and London for price of food and drinks. We knew the hotel would be expensive as all 5 star hotels are but even when venturing into Mykonos town the price of food and drink is high.",0
This is an amazing hotel with superb design features. The staff are all exceptional and were there for your every need whilst not being obvious at all. Our room was beautiful with an incredible view and we were brought champagne and chilled fruit once settled as we were on our honeymoon. This hotel is an experience - it is welcoming but not homely - it really is a destination to visit. It is approx 20 mins drive from Mykonos town so you will need a hire car which you can easily get from the hotel or you can use the daily shuttle that offers free trips into town. We dined at the hotel on our last night and it was the best meal we had on the island - the quality was amazing for what I considered a reasonable price. The only minus point was the soundproofing between the rooms wasn't great and we could hear next doors TV on occasion. There is also a great spa at the hotel and whilst I could thoroughly appreciate we were in a high end establishment I thought that the spa prices were extremely high. To summarise - I would have no hesitation in recommending Utopia for a short stay.   Room Tip: The higher the floor the better the view! See more room tips,1
"Stayed here Sept 30-October 5. There is nothing bad to say!! We were travelling for our 25 anniversary, we were treated like royalty. Kostas(sp, sorry) the manager went out of his way the entire trip to make it unforgettable for us, thank you Kostas, I will try your roast beef recipe. The lady's working the front Geogina, was lovely. The Hostess (I didn't get her name). Was so pleasant! Amelios, a server, what a lovely young man. The two bartenders, Kostas and Nicolous (?) outstanding. I hope we can return one day. Thank you, all for an unforgettable vacation!!!!",1
"We stayed in the Utopian villa that overlooked the sea. The food and service were top rate. The hotel had a private beach at the bottom of the mountain. My only complaint was that even though they ran a free shuttle to the old town, you were on your own to go elsewhere on the island. Twice we called for a taxi but none was to be found. Taxis are hard to come by.The hotel offered their own livery service at an exorbitant 60 euros. If I had to do over again, I would have rented a a car from day 1.",0
"We had a wonderful time at Utopia for our honeymoon the last week of September, 2015. Our room, 665, was incredible - huge inside, full balcony with hot tub, elevated bed, walk in closet and multiple seating areas, and a great view of the sea. Although above the restaurant, it was quiet (and also convenient to the pool, gym and breakfast). The staff was fantastic, particularly Costas, the manager, the hostess and Amelios, our waiter most days. We spent every day mixed between the pool (with incredible views from the infinity pool) and the beach (which was an easy shuttle ride away, and the Utopia has its own private area with seat side service). We loved the breakfast, served buffet style, where we would spend over an hour each morning before heading to lay out next to the pool. We had no problems at all during our stay, and cannot say enough how much we enjoyed our week at Utopia.",1
Beautiful scenary! Nice decorations! Excellent setup! Infinity pool with wonderful panoramic seaview of Elia beach. Great photo taken!Nothing unpleasant at all! We have such a memorable time in this place!,1
"Beautiful modern hotel with all the luxuries you can which for and a beautiful view. Great restaurant kitchen (both breakfast, lunch and diner) which means that you can stay ""home"" if you don't feel like eating out. I deliberately use the word ""home'' because of the great service and the awesome people working in the hotel. Each of them treats you as if you are coming home to your family. I can't think of anything which did not fulfill our needs during our stay at the Utopia Resort. The only two things I could think of would be that the wifi-signal (in our room) is not great and should we return to the Utopia Resort next year we will arrange a different room because of the location beneath the restaurant. This will prevent the noise of moving chairs and walking people early in the morning and late in the evening. Other than than its perfect and we will definitely return to this hotel! Utopia has its own private beach which is reachable by shuttle (you can also walk if you like to climb the steep streets to the hotel, but I would not recommend that). Some practical information is that we would advise you the visite Mykonos before the last week of september. During our stay (28/09 - 05/10) a lot of the restaurants and bars on the island were closed already. Also, keep in mind that the Utopia Resort has a location which is about 20 min (17 km) away from Mykonos City. The hotel provides you with a free shuttle service (by bus) or you can take a taxi which will cost you about 25 EURO.   Room Tip: Rooms above the restaurant are more quiet then underneath. See more room tips",1
"It is the most beautiful point of Mykonos. No need to go anywhere else once you are here. A special note for the very good manager, who took good care of us during the stay taking every consideration of the injury my husband had in the previous island. It is unfortunate to have an accident during holiday but it is fortunate we have chosen Utopia.",1
"We were originally booked into the Avaton but on arrival found we were upgraded to a larger room at the Utopia also with it's own jacuzzi. I suspect this might be something to do with good management as the guset numbers diminish towards the end of the season but we were not disappointed. From a welcome greeting with a glass of prosecco at the Avaton we were escorted in a car to the Utopia. On arrival we were greeted like long lost friends, received a guided tour of the hotel and amenities and were able to have dinner. The room was sensational. Large size with understated decor and a wonderful view out over Elia beach to Paros and Naxos. On the balcony was a lovely jacuzzi. In the hotel there is a restaurant and infinity pool area with bar, a spa area and a gym. Having visited all five hotels in the resort during our stay, the Utopia is definitely the smallest and most intimate with little walking required. It is at the highest point on the resort so the views are spectacular.The website doesn't really explain the setup here. It is one big resort subdivided into 5 hotels. You can go anywhere and the obliging reception will book a table at any resort and order transport around the resort which is good as it is on a steep hillside. Transport arrives in a few minutes but you will probably have been handed a glass of water to drink while you wait. You may even be lucky to be transported in a Porsche SUV. Once in any of the other resorts, payment is just by signing. There is free transport to Mykonos town if you feel you need to leave the resort.Wherever you are you are treated with courtesy and friendliness. Attention is always prompt but not obtrusive. Costas, the manager of the Utopia is a charming friendly man and makes sure your holiday is perfect. He will sort any concerns if his staff have not already. Special mention must go to Aimilios, one of our waiters, but all the staff were great. Our room cleaing lady was wonderful. Our towels were changed almost as soon as they were damp.This was a special holiday. Thank you Costas and everyone.",1
"Exquisite junior suite with amazing private pool!! Food and drinks are great! This hotel is modern chic with breathtaking views! Mykonos beaches are super fun and beautiful. Try and visit super paradise, utopia beach, and Khalua beach bar!!The service in the hotel was excellent. The spa was unique!!! The restaurant experience was splendid! Spend a couple the days at the pool! Loved it and will come back next year!!!! Jorge and Luisa Garci",1
"This property is really fabulous, new, great design and very nice and professional staff. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable with a huge brand new TV. Not a lot of english channels though, but it seems to be the norm in Greece. Free shuttles to the beach and town are very timely and frequent, and are nice Mercedes comfortable vehicles. I almost never say this, but I would actually stay there again and not try a different property. Price was under $300 a night, so really great value as well. Guest manager Costas is super helpful and professional.",1
"This is a wonderful hotel at an beautiful location with an amazing staff! The food was of an exceptional quality. Our special thanks to the manager Costas, he is always present to fulfill all your wishes. Nothing is too much to ask! This is a hotel to remenber.   Room Tip: take a room with seaview you Will not regret it. See more room tips",1
"Would recommend to everyone. Pros: The views were spectacular, the aesthetics were amazing, the staff was very helpful, there is a (free) shuttle that takes you down to the beach and into town and you can use any of the Myconian pools or restaurants if you stay here. Cons: The rooms are small, the pool is cold and the staff pushes making dinner reservations at the resort. Would definitely come back and stay.",0
"This is heaven on earth. PERFECTION IN EVERY SENSE. Outstanding service and staff. Amazing vibe and atmosphere all around. We were so warmly welcomed by the entire staff at the resort. The manager, Kostas looked after us amazingly, was more than helpful to us constantly and made our stay beyond Magical.The food at the restaurant was excellent, the best Mykonos has to offer! The breakfast was FANTASTIC. Room was very well decorated with amazing water views! All of the staff felt like a family to us.... it was very hard to leave!! CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!!",1
From the moment we entered until leaving we felt welcomed at the resort by an ever present staff ( they live there during the season) who often remember guest preferences. We were able to use resort amenities for all the properties ( they have 5 properties in the immediate area) and found them all very nice. Our room was cleaned at least twice a day by the sweetest woman ever who even brought us softer pillows on request. You must try their breakfast it was a highlight every day.,2
"You really don't have to think to long about booking this hotel just book it you will not be disappointed .From the moment you walk into the hotel you know you are somewhere very special.From the welcome you get at Mykynos airport and the time you unfortunately have to leave the whole experience is truly memorable .The room we stayed in was 757 which was at the top floor of all and the views were just breathtaking.The choice you get at breakfast was always excellent ,everything is fresh and plenty of and served to you by the most lovely staff.The pool sun beds are probably the best we've ever laid on and there is also a private part of the beach where only the hotel guest can go,there was always enough beds.Lastly I must mention a few members of staff who go that extra mile to make your stay perfect.Mary always had a great big smile when welcoming you into the Breakfast room,George and Amilos the waiters really couldn't do enough for you .Costa's ,you and your team really made our holiday one we will remember for a long time.",4
"The newest hotel from the Myconian Collection, Utopia sits at the top of a hill overlooking Elia Beach. Modern, sleek with original art and sculpture everywhere this is a Relais & Chateau hotel and they take the distinction seriously. The hotel took two years to build and it shows in the design elements. The rooms are modern and well designed. Everything has been thought out down to the fact that there is no obvious place for towels until you realize that's why the coat tree is there and no toilet paper holder but a stool instead! This is intentional! The hotel is quiet; no pounding music but at the pool a DJ plays music geared to what he thinks people might want to hear. There is nothing that the staff won't do for you. Special kudos to Kostas, the hotel ambassador. He is the face of the hotel. He was there to meet us when we arrived and was always around for a great restaurant recommendation, a joke, a smile. He is the ultimate host. And his staff is the best. From the minute we got off the ferry and were met by a driver from the hotel and loaded into a tricked out Army green Jeep with baseball stitching, we knew we were in for something special. The hotel is a half-hour from Mykonos town; for some that might not be optimal but for us it was perfect. We rented a car but after we were told that there is a shuttle service to town and car service to the private beach, we canceled the car. It always worked out perfectly with the last bus at 12:30am you could go into town, walk around, have dinner and be on the late bus back to the hotel. If you miss the bus, it's about 25 Euros.Breakfast - unbelievable! Everything you can image hot and cold. And, f you can believe it - bagels and lox!! The infinity pool was a fun place to hang out in the afternoon after the beach. A representative of the Spa walked around letting everyone sample products in the afternoon. Everything by St. Barths product line of sun oils to sun protection product for your hair. The private beach club on Elia Beach, which is one of the most beautiful on Mykonos, was a huge plus. Car service to the beach, there is always a sun lounger and umbrella available for hotel guests with lunch and drink service and a Spa representative walking around letting people sample products from the Spa. And you could walk down the beach and rent a jet ski, or go paragliding or rent a private boat to take you to another beach. The spa was excellent.And, the restaurant, at night very dramatic with candles in unusual wood sculpture candleholders on each table. We spent our last night having dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food impeccable with fish filleted table side. Before dinner, special cocktails by the bar's mixologist. After, dinner some farewell drinks.Utopia was Utopia for us!!   Room Tip: Size of room depends on price point but all rooms have fantastic view See more room tips",1

This hotel certainly knows how to deliver a great customer experience. All staff are so courteous and nothing is too much trouble.The pools are great and with having the option to use any of the 7 hotels you are spoilt for choice!Although it is a distance from Mykonos town it has a free shuttle bus so that is a bonusBreakfast is fantastic with lots of choice including champagne.A return visit is definitely on the cards ....,2
"Mykonos was our last stop to our 12 day trip to Greece. We stayed at King George in Athens, Mystique in Santorini, and Elounda Mare in Crete. Of all of the hotels we stayed in, this was by far the best one. I wish we had booked more time to stay at the Myconian Utopia. The service was exceptional. The hotel manager took time to speak with each guest and everyone was very friendly and helpful. The property itself is amazing. We stayed in the Grand Majestic Villa with Private Pool – 2 bedrooms and everything about our room was fantastic. The beds were very comfortable, there was plenty of room to entertain in the living room, and the private pool/outdoor space/views were phenomenal! I love the way this hotel is designed. Lot of attention to detail and quality. The hotel breakfast is soooo good. There is also a quick and free shuttle to Elia beach. We liked this location and would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",3
"Wow I have just returned from this fabulous hotel and I cannot rate it or recommend it high enough. This was my third trip to Mykonos and having enjoyed the Ambassador hotel which is part of this small family owned group I decided to try the Utopia. I chose Utopia due to is aesthetics having been an interior designer and the boyfriend and I both have a tendency for stylish hotels which offer great service. The service was fantastic the moment we set through the doors. Costas the hotel manager greeted us with a glass of prosecco and showed us around. We were upgraded to a fantastic room over the pool. The view was spectacular and the high quality of the fittings and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. The finish is superb and the rooms are well equipped. The housekeeping was also very good and our room always looked and felt so clean and was always so lovely to come back to. The pool area was fantastic with always enough sunbeds and a brilliantly attentive service. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was served with a big smile. Breakfast was consistently a feast with fantastic variety and it wasn't any trouble at all for the hotel to arrange for me to have almond milk. The service was so efficient that after day one we never had to re-order our coffee, each morning we arrived our order was then brought out to us. It is this kind of attention to details that sets this hotel apart. Lunch and supper were also both excellent. A great menu (I am a fussy eater and super healthy) and always ate really well. Wine list was great too and we really loved the Greek wines. I have also stayed at the Grace (not a patch on Utopia), I have been to the Belvedere a few times for drinks/dinner but the Utopia just has everything. Costas runs such a great team and the atmosphere is second to none. The team work so hard but it shows that they really love what they do. The whole team were so smiley and genuinely interested where we were going every day/evening and whether we had a great time. We didn't use the spa to be honest. We used the gym which has an amazing view. There are always bowls of fruit around which is lovely mid-sunbathe to pop and get an apple! The photos on the website really are true to the hotel. Having worked with photographers shooting properties I am aware of how things are propped and angles and lenses used etc so I wasn't expecting the hotel to be quite as fabulous as the photos but it truly truly is! To summarise but I think you get the gist..... I LOVE UTOPIA!!! Quick tips on where we loved to go - (late 30's early 40's fun couple, foodies, healthy with good taste!) Scorpios - incredible food. Seriously incredible. Great house music all day which gradually builds up for sunset. Fab design. We went twice. Would definitely go again for dinner. Panormos beach - more boho, good food and lovely beach club. Interni - always my favourite and always will be. Dinner and late drinks. Uno Con Carne - amazing sushi and steak dinner. I hope this was helpful and enjoy your stay at Utopia! We will certainly be back next year without question!",6
"We arrived here on Saturday expecting to stay at the Avaton, however due to a large wedding they asked us to stay here for 2 days. Wow. The restaurant serves food that would shame restaurants in New York, London, Sydney (my 3 favourite cities) with amazing views and helpful staff. After dinner, a cocktail made by the mixologist is a must - not often the term is well deserved. If you can get a room with a private pool do - however the hotel pool is amazing and near the cocktail bar.",2
"Stayed here for 3 nights in an Executive suite. Room extremely quiet with little to no road noise from the big roadway not far away. Bed very comfortable, staff very friendly and helpful. Small kitchenette available in room. Plenty of wardrobe room. Good size hairdryer. Air con worked well. This hotel is in walking distance of the Plaka region with many restaurants and shops. Also within very easy walking distance of other shopping areas and the Acropolis, Hadrians Gate and other sites. Very short wwlk to bus stop for hop on hop off bus. We had a balcony with sitting area but it was way too hot to be outside. Very pleasant place to stay.",1
Great hotel in central location for getting to all the sites on foot. The room was clean and very comfortable. We were three and the third bed was just as comfortable as the regular beds. Plenty of room with a kitchenette. Bathroom was adaquet though the shower very small. Definately would stay here again.,1
"Hotel was fine, but did not seem near worth the price. The room was strange - on the first floor of the hotel, with a kitchen in the bedroom. The bathroom had hair in the shower when we arrived. It was also quite loud in the morning - the sound of slamming doors and the kitchen kept us awake from 7 am on the last day of our vacation. Did not even compare to another hotel we stayed at in Athens for the same price.",2
"What a find this hotel is! Spacious modern room with a well equipped kitchenette, and a very smart bathroom with excellent shower. We had a balcony but no view from the regular suites. Beautifully clean, large comfortable bed, lots of drawer and wardrobe space. A very comfortable room to come back to after a day's sightseeing. In an excellent location, with very helpful staff, I would definitely recommend this hotel.",1
"My wife, 19 year old daughter, and I spent four days at the Ava Hotel in early August. We had plenty of room for the three of us and it was a lovely, quiet hotel very close to the Acropolis and the old section of Athens. We were also close to restaurants, shopping, and other historical sites. The hotel is modern, very comfortable, near one of the main streets but on a quiet side street. While we were there, it was quiet and a great place to collapse after a long, hot day on the ruins. The staff was helpful and we very much enjoyed our stay there. Also provided very good breakfasts--great croissants. The view was not spectacular as we looked at a building across the street--but if you looked to the right, we could see, at night, a flag waving over the illuminated Parthenon. Very cool.",0
"NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL. I do not understand how they have received just a high rating on TripAdvisor, makes me second guess the whole review system. I just came from the AVA, spent one night with my family (actually barely 8 hours) and was told I was going to be charged 376 euros for the night (I booked a large room so my family of 5 would be comfortable). 376 Euros for the small, stuffy, basic boutique hotel that is not impressive in any way, is a generous amount I would argue. HOWEVER-- on our way out, at 5:30am to catch a ferry, we were given a bill that charged us an EXTRA 102 Euros. Total room charge was 478 EURO. Absolutely a rip off, and they told us of this charge as we were about to jump into a taxi. I was charged ""extra"" since they had to bring a rollaway bed to my room? for the extra pieces of toast at the breakfast? THIS PLACE IS A SCAM. The breakfast was less than mediocre (barely a basic continental style), don't pay extra for the breakfast-- there are many juice bars and restos in the area. ALSO: the bathroom was small and in need of a renovation for this price. The furnishings are very stuffy and not modern at all. The hotel is on a somewhat busy street. On the way home, we stayed at the luxurious Hilton, for 360 Euros (including a spectacular breakfast!! pool! gym! 2 bathrooms! modern!). It shows that this place is milking its location, but really the Hilton and other great options are very close by. DO NOT STAY at the AVA. Check out the Hilton or other great hotels that deserve every penny.   Room Tip: Do not stay at this hotel. The rooms are tired and need renovation!! See more room tips",3
"A nice Boutique hotel with walking distance from the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum and the temple of Olympian Zeus.The Executive Suite is suitable for families travelling with young children, the Suite is spacious, with the option of a sofa bed and an extra bed for the children to sleep in the living room. A small and well equipped kitchenette is available too, wifi was fast and consistent throughout the hotel.Staff from reception, housekeeping and the restaurant were very attentive to our needs.Thank you for a great stay!",1
"2 minutes by foot to the Entrance to the Acropolis and the same distance to the Temple of Olympian Zeus, this gem of a hotel is characterized by elegant well appointed suites and extraordinarily helpful staff. An added bonus is the fastest wifi I have ever experienced anywhere!",0
"This was our second visit to AVA over the past few years and we were not disappointedly! The two key selling points for us are the location in the Plaka (but very quiet) and the suite format of the rooms. The property is of a very decent standard without being over the top, a quality smaller hotel rather than a glitzy 5 star palace. Friendly staff and a reasonable breakfast complete the mix. We would look no further should we again return to Athens",0
"It has an amazing location, very friendly and helpful staff and I recommend highly the family room perfect for families traveling with kids. Breakfast is perfect for adults may be can add a little more options for kids. May be need to add more to the concierge services in the sense of having more connection to the booking of island trips...etc. They provide you with a map that outlines the surroundings of the hotel and it's really helpful.Thank you for a lovely stay.Noha",0
"This hotel, just a few steps up from Hadrian’s Arch was in a perfect location! The best part was that the room was so spacious for a European hotel. It was basically an American suites hotel with a separate master bedroom and in the living room a small pullout couch (with a thin mattress) for our 12-year old girl and a narrow rollaway bed for our 9-year old boy. There was a small kitchenette as well. My kids loved the old-fashioned elevator. The best part was that they arranged a fantastic personal tour guide (named Gemma – definitely hire her if available) for us for our day on the Acropolis. Awesome stay!!!",0
"This hotel itself doesn't blow you away, but the location is just about the best possible one in Athens. Don't get me wrong, the room we had was beautiful, and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. But the #1 ranking surely comes from its location, right in the Plaka. Literally walk out the door and you can see Hadrian's Arch. Look the other direction, you can see the Acropolis. This is a very clean and comfortable hotel, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",0
First visit to Athens (and Greece). Was worried about the standard of hotel accommodation so decided to book Ava Hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor.The location is excellent. The staff so friendly. I was checked in my Maria who is just lovely.Was a bit shocked by the amount of graffiti on the street (see photos) but all Athens seems to be like this! Ava hotel really is a lovely little place and the location is great. Plaka is (despite the graffiti) a picturesque area and it's a great location for the Acropolis.I stayed in room 401 which has a nice little courtyard.Would def. stay here again if I came back to Athens.,0
"This is the first online review that I've ever left. Wanted everyone to know that this hotel has the perfect location, the staff is very accommodating, and the rooms are fabulous, even by USA standards! It's an elegant, well appointed one bedroom apartment.",1
"The hotel is up the street from Zeus's temple entry. Very convenient location to all shopping and dining options. The room was nice and very clean and I would recommend this hotel as an option when staying in Athens. The rooms offer a kitchen, snacks and videos if you are staying for an extended period of time",0
"Our extended family stayed here at the begging of July. Had a great 2 night stay. Staff were friendly and helpful in particular Andreani who was amazing and went out of our way to help us. Rooms clean and surprisingly spacious including kitchenette and two fridges (one bar fridge, the other complimentary for guests).Breakfast buffet good each day and located close to Acropolis. Would stay again",0
"We really enjoyed our stay at the AVA hotel. The suite was huge and a wonderful terrace. Of course, it was very hot, so the use of the terrace was mostly the early morning of evening. The location was perfect for visiting the plaka and attractions.The best part was the hotel staff. They always welcomed us with a nice hello and were very attentive.We got their Greek Myth package which had nice surprises. Sweets, liquor, breakfast.Great stay   Room Tip: The top floor Acropolis view room was great See more room tips",0
"This is our second visit to Athens, and we were looking around at different establishments, but could not find anywhere that had as much room, had a kitchenette, was central and had mostly good reviews. We stayed in a room that had a balcony out the front that had views to the Acropolis and Hadrian's Gate. The room again was clean and very comfortable, with plenty of room. The bed and couch was very comfortable and we did enjoy using the ottoman after walking all day. The staff were very helpful and friendly, On arrival in Athens, my husband was pick pocketed and the staff were extremely helpful in assisting us with arrangements and contacting the local police to report the theft. They also had taxi's waiting for us as requested and always met us with a smile. The hotel is very close to the Acropolis and Plaka areas, with several eateries within a 500m radius, 2 small supermarkets and 2 bank ATM's wthin 200m of the hotel. The real advantage of AVA is the kitchenette, for you able to make meals/snacks at any time, especially helpful when dealing with jetlag after 23 hours in a plane. One small inconvenience was that we had to always leave our key at reception, as these were the last 2 rooms to be changed over to an automated system. Reception is manned 24 hours a day, so no real issue and reassuring for security. Noted an earlier review taking about the shower recess, we found that these were very common in Europe. We could not say any areas were unclean, just a little dated in the decor. The linens and towels were clean and fresh. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Athens.",0
"This was where we stayed in Athens during our honeymoon right across Europe, and the room was very large and of fairly nice quality - not luxurious but above average. However bathroom is ageing and definitely can do with a refresh.View of the Acropolis, as well as walking distance. Service is decent with generally helpful staff.",0
"This small luxury hotel is on a quiet side street a block away from the Plaka. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful and our suite with a small balcony looking out at the Acropolis was beautiful (including a recessed painted ceiling and blue marble in the bathroom). Breakfast is served buffet style in the lobby (no rooftop dining here) and was above average. The location is great because the Acropolis access and museum are easy walking distance as is the Plaka, Syntagma Square, and the old Olympic Stadium. Highly recommended.",1
"This hotel is perfectly fine but not amazing or extraordinary by any stretch of the imagination. There are only about 30 rooms here and it is very small. The lobby feels old and not very appealing when you check in. The staff is nice but not over the top. We got a suite for my family of 4 and it was big enough for us all. It also had a kitchenette that we did not need since there are hundreds of places to eat nearby and no grocery stores. The location is great and very centrally located so this is the best part of the hotel.The worst thing was the horrible bathrooms that they do not picture on the website. I have attached photos of the tube like shower in our suite. My kids would not shower because the shower was so small they thought they could not breathe with the doors shut. I had to force them into the shower. It was quite horrible and the ""white"" towels had an off white tint to them and felt really old.Recap: Great location, nice staff, smaller hotel with run down common areas, but clean enough and we were comfortable....but not impressed.",0
"We were very impressed with this boutique hotel as the location was excellently situated in Plaka not far from the Acropolis. The apartment was just ideal for my wife and I and of a high standard. The service was good, they even gave us a couple of small bottles of nice bubbly as welcome drinks. Breakfast was very good too. They don't do dinner but quite frankly they don't need to as there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.Highly recommended.   Room Tip: We had a standard apartment on floor 1 (104)at the rear and it was quiet with a little balcony overl... See more room tips",0
"This was the last night of a month long trip in Europe so my friend and I splurged and booked the suite with terrace and were not disappointed! It was the cover picture from the website!! It was spacious, beautiful decore (even doves painted on the bathroom ceilings) free coffee making, champagne and of course the view of the Acropolis from the large terrace. We arrived the minute we could and left at the latest check=out just to make sure we got our money's worth. If you want a luxury night- pick the suite!!   Room Tip: Have stayed in rooms with no balcony/terrace and they are nice but suite with terrace first-class! See more room tips",0
"The room was clean and spacious. Air conditioning was excellent, even in the heat of summer. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a room for three and it was plenty big. Nice bathroom and kitchenette. They left champagne for us. Would certainly stay again.",1
"Had a wonderful 3 night stay which was definitely needed after a long flight from LAX and to kick off 20 days in Greece. Location, room and amenities all 1st class. Stay in a suite - you will not regret it!",0
My family stayed at the AVA Hotel before our cruise and couldn't of been happier with our choice. The location is perfect. You can walk to all of the sites in Athens including the Acropolis. I have attached a picture of the Hadrians Arch and the hotel is just on the other side of the Arch down the street on the right side. You can also see the Acropolis!! The staff was very nice and even left us two small bottles of wine!! The room had a kitchenette and a small balcony. If you are from the United States remember to bring an electrical converter!! I would highly recommend this hotel.,0
"A small, boutique hotel ideally located for the sightseer. The facility is clean and modern. The staff greet you with a smile and are very accommodating. My room was spacious, quiet and comfortably air conditioned. It was an easy walk to the Parthenon and other interesting sights, as well as the pedestrian markets in the adjacent neibourhood   Room Tip: I don't believe there are any fantastic views from the hotel, so don't fret about it. See more room tips",0
"This was an exceptional hotel. Small and very well appointed. It reminded me of a Ritz Carleton hotel. The interior of the hotel is well appointed and the rooms are very well done. As an American traveling, you felt like you were in the states. The air conditioning, bathroom, amenities, tv, bed, windows carpeting and lighting was first class. there is a cafe for breakfast. the price is 16 euro each. I thought it was a little high, but it included eggs and an array of other items. You may also get a package where it is included. Wifi worked great. we had a balcony on the street that overlooked the acropolis, and in the other direction the Agora. Unbelievable at night. Yo are steps from food, shops and historical sites. what an incredible find for our family. The bathroom was great for 2 adults and 2 kids. A rare find in Europe.   Room Tip: windows insulate all noise. Plus the balcony is great to just enjoy a view. Ask for a street view... See more room tips",1
"If you like that boutique hotel that goes out of its way to make you welcome, this is the place. We had a wonderful experience at AVA. We needed an iron and they brought it up very quickly. They delivered complementary sparkling white wine. So close to everything. You can walk everywhere. If they have availability, you better snag it!!!!",1
"I visited athens and stayed 2 days in this Hotel.our room was simply nice and big with a great outside view of athens.this Hotel has a excellent wifi service so you could never be away from social contact such as facebook,twitter or whatsapp!!We really enjoyed the delicious greece food in this hotel with my uncle.the lobby decor of the hotel was so good and beautiful!!Definitely I will Come Back to this hotel on my next trip to Athens",0
"The AVA Hotel was a lovely oasis of calm in a busy tourist area. It was wonderful to be steps away from all the action- but to have a retreat from all the crowds and noise. Our room (a ""standard suite"") was clean, spacious, and had very effective air conditioning (a major major plus in a hot and sweaty city!) The front desk staff were very helpful with arranging transportation and dinner reservations. They even stored a bag for us for 10 days while we were on our cruise! I was happier at this hotel than my last stay in Athens in a very expensive 5 star hotel.   Room Tip: interior courtyard was very quiet See more room tips",1
My family and I stayed here last week. It is in a perfect location and the staff is extremely helpful. The rooms and clean and spacious. There is a small kitchenette that has all the glassware that one could need. I would definitely recommend!,0
"Ideally located in the Plaka. Wonderful staff and clean, spacious room on a quiet street. We stayed in an Executive Suite which was very roomy, comfortable and had all the amenities. Excellent breakfast with eggs and bacon cooked to order. The staff contacted is six weeks in advance and arranged a private Acropolis tour for us with a wonderful guide. We would definitely recommend and would stay again. Went for a wedding at the end of June and it was very hot. Would avoid this time of year next time.",0
"Location, location, location. Our room at Ava was very nice as we upgraded to a sweet. Nice bottle of bubbles was waiting for us in our room when we arrived and the room was spotless at all times. The best thing about this hotel, though, is location. Just a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis museum and well situated for the other attractions of Athens. Breakfast was also substantial and tasty. Very nice experience overall!",0
"Perfect location, a five minute walk to Acropolis, Archaeological Museum, National Gardens, Zappoie, Olympiad of Zeus and the Plaka neighborhood. Either view from street front is attractive with Zeus to the East and Acropolis to the West. Boutique hotel with friendly staff, welcoming lobby, and spacious extremely well appointed rooms with bathrooms having two shower heads for that ever relaxing shower after a day in the heat. Plenty of shopping begins after two rights out of the hotel. Breakfast is very convenient in the lobby with a variety of offerings for any kind of taste, and worth the very reasonable charge. Nice relaxing happy hour 7-9 pm and many restaurant options within a short walking distance. One of the best boutique hotels we have stayed in. Highest recommendation.",0
"My husband and I stayed at the Ava hotel for two nights along with my sister and husband. I was afraid we would get small rooms because of the great location of this hotel, just few minutes walk from the Acropolis. Well we didnt...both our rooms were big, comfortable and clean with a small kitchinette, and a good-sized bathroom. The staff was very kind, polite and helpful during our stay; the breakfast was good with a good variety of food...the pita bread though was missing :).Thank you Ava hotel for a lovely stay in Athens!",0
"Lovely staff, convenient location to shops and restaurants in the Plaka area. Our room was clean, charming and had a small kitchen. Very quiet and a nice place to come ""home"" to after sightseeing. Would book again!   Room Tip: We had a room off the street and with kitchen. Quite spacious See more room tips",0
"This is a charming boutique hotel on the edge of Plaka in Athens. It is outstanding in every way. The rooms are spacious, beautifully maintained, and very quiet. The staff are quite welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The location is convenient for everything a tourist could need. There is nothing to fault, and everything to love!   Room Tip: We stayed twice, once on the first floor and once on the second floor. both rooms were equally conf... See more room tips",1
"This boutique hotel has a genial location. It is only 75 metres from Beautiful Plaka, but totally quiet and relaxed. You are a short walk from a whole bundle of historic sites, restaurants, bars and small shops. Ava has a friendly staff and the rooms are pure oasis from the heat and hustle and bustle that can be a part of Athens on a hot summer day. Our room had a big balcony where we would have our breakfast and drinks. The rooms has a small kitchen where there is an extra fridge you can fill with your refreshments of choice. The rooms are elegantly decorated the bathroom in room 301 is a bit bigger than 302, but these two rooms a re great with separate living room and bedroom. Perfect for our little family of 3.   Room Tip: Room 301 and 302 has a huge balcony and separate living room/ bedroom See more room tips",0
"The location was perfect. The staff was very friendly and courteous. 24 hr coverage at the lobby desk. The customer is always first in the attitudes of this staff.The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable and I am not easy to please in that department.Bathroom shower worked well and was supplied with towels and toiletries.The a/c worked great and room location was quiet. So between the location, bed, and room darkening shades, a great night sleep was accomplished. I would recommend this place highly. They do have a restaurant that serves a full breakfast butwe chose to dine out.We stayed in room 304. Faces the back away from street. No great view but who cares, sleep is the priority here",0
This is a small but efficient boutique hotel.It had a small kitchenette which was very helpful.The main attractions were within minutes.The Acropolis and Hadrians arch could be seen from the balcony.Very sweet and helpful staff.Couldnt fault it at all.The only gripe I had with hotels in Greece in general were that they don't provide bottled water even tho it's a fraction of the cost you're paying for the room.That said I was very happy with Ava.,0
"Located right in Plaka with views of Acropolis a block away. Rooms are spacious especially by Greek standards. # 202 has a fully stocked kitchenette, sofa bed in living room and a seperate private bedroom. Greeted with car service from airport (50euros) very reasonably priced to champagne upon our arrival. Strictly booked based on tripadvisor ratings, so I'm glad to confirm all the positive remarks and pay it forward. Congratulations to the staff.",1
"We chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reports for pre and post cruise accommodation on the Star Clipper . We were not disappointed with either!The staff were very pleasant, helpful and very considerate. After travelling some 24 hours we were welcomed by reception and shown our room with the minimum of fuss or administration. The room was on the 3rd floor, clean well maintained with cooking facilities and mini bar. Our second post cruise room we chose was on the ground floor. Both had ample storage for our cases and a divine bathroom.The location in Plaka was within a short walk to the Accropolis and its museum.Very handy for restaurants and shopping in Plaka. We will stay again on return to Athens.   Room Tip: Upper floors for the best view but the ground floor for space and outside patio with table and chair... See more room tips",2
"We stayed for one night between arriving by ship one morning and flying home the next day. The location in the Plaka is excellent, close to good tavernas and historical sites. The management was outstandingly pleasant and anticipated all of our needs. The hotel breakfast was more than adequate, Our room (#101), actually a suite with a separate bedroom, was very clean, comfortable, and attractive.We normally stay in more expensive hotels, but I can't see any reason for doing so in Athens and would return again.",2
"When we entered the lobby of the Ava Hotel we wondered if we had made a mistake. The lobby could really use a renovation. But when we got to our room we knew that we had made the right choice. The room was large, clean and really nice and comfortable. The location was perfect for walking to all of the major sights, restaurants and shopping.The wifi was free and worked perfectly.",1
"We were delighted by the location of Ava Hotel, in a small street so close to Plaka shops and restaurants and walking distance to the Acropolis. I had helpful emails from them before arrival and they organized for us to be met at the airport by a taxi for only a bit more than the usual taxi fare.The driver they arranged had an immaculate car, spoke English and gave us a bottle of water when we hopped in. Our ground floor room was lovely, spacious and very clean. It even included a kitchen and courtyard. We were made very welcome.There was complimentary welcome sparkling moscato waiting for us. Later we tried the cocktails at the pleasantly decorated bar-nice!   Room Tip: Ground floor rooms have a courtyard and are quiet. Did not see higher rooms. See more room tips",1
"Really great start to our trip. Couldn't get a better location. Greeted with champagne on arrival. Great little courtyard. Staff were incredibly helpful, showed us routes to walk around on map. Only stayed here one night, wish we stayed longer",1
"We stayed at this hotel in Athens for 2 days. The location is unbeatable and we had a wonderful balcony and view of the Acropolis. The staff was so helpful and went out of their way to help with dinner reservations and directions. One minor suggestion: change the carpets. They are old and ugly. Otherwise, superb!!",0
"The location of the hotel was very good to see all the historical sites. We had difficulty in Paris airport so we missed our connection to Greece. We arrived after midnight and yet an elder gentleman helped us with our bags from curb to elevator. They then gave us room service of cheese and salad that was outstanding. We stayed only one day in Athens and asked for hotel recommendations for dinner. A young man recommended Attikos and he did not disappoint. The meal was on a roof top facing the Acropolis. Amazing food, great service and outstanding view. We love the hotel! My sister is celebrating her birthday and when Maria found out she sent us champagne .",0
"The Ava is an excellent choice right in the Plaka district of Athens. All ancient sites within walking distance as is the main shopping area. The hotel staff are incredibly professional and helpful in assisting with personalised tours. Rooms are large, clean, beds comfortable. Kitchenettes are well equipped. It truly is a five star boutique hotel. Breakfasts are delicious with a huge range of freshly cooked food. Free wi fi and works very well. Checkout is 1200 which is great. Would highly recommend.   Room Tip: One bedroom apartment is spacious and great for a few days stay. View of Temple of Acropolis and Tem... See more room tips",1
"I'm surprised this is so highly rated. I am currently staying in this hotel, Friday May 27, and the hotel is great, but the staff could not care less about me. I asked for a dinner reservation and the front desk said there were no tables open for two hours. Found a table after walking for 5 minutes. Tried to call room service and it was a little late, and they denied all requests. Athens is nothing like Mykonos or Santorini. If you take a trip to Greece, don't waste your money in Athens, tons of graffiti and generally unsafe atmosphere. Spent 320 Euros on a suite here, last leg of my honeymoon, and regret it.   Room Tip: Not worth Exec Suite See more room tips",1
"This is definitely a wonderful boutique hotel. There are only 15 rooms so it's very quiet but the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The location is fabulous - we walked everywhere. The breakfast was excellent with hot and cold items, they even had soy milk on request. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was better than mine at home. I most definitely would stay here again but might upgrade to the other side of the hotel to get a view of the Acropolis from the balcony. Highly recommend.",1
"This hotel in Plaka was the perfect choice for our short stay in Athens. The location couldn't be better: we could easily walk to everything. The rooms were large, clean, well equipped and fastidiously clean. The staff were very helpful setting up taxi from the airport, walking tours, and an excellent taxi tour to Delphi with Giannis.Maria, on reception, was most helpful with late night restaurant recommendations when we arrived and with our email requests for information before we arrived. We loved this hotel and felt safe coming and going at all hours. We hope to return to Athens and this will definitely be our hotel choice!!!",0
"Right at the edge of the plaka this little hotel is very comfortable, the rooms are big and very clean and the room service attentive and fast. The concierge Helps you in any way and on your arrival you find a bottle of wine and a little snack in your bedroom.. I will definetely come back",0
"Read the reviews here on TripAdvisor. They were prettty accurate. It was centrally located, clean, friendly and safe. The staff was very helpful from beginning to end. They informed you of nearby tourist locations. The view was great from our window which on one end you can see the Hadrian Gate and the other, the Parthenon. Athens is very walkable. The metro to and from the airport is not to far (lots of travelers use this means of transportation). The shops are to 2 mins away. We hired a private car for outside the city tours and they knew the hotel. The hotel people try to up sell a higher level larger room but ours on the 2nd floor was already pretty nicely decorated and spacious (we saved the money for shopping) The whole area is safe for evening strolls. Breakfast was available.   Room Tip: Ask for a street view window See more room tips",1
The Ava Hotel and Suites was the perfect location for exploring the historical sites and shopping. The staff was very helpful. The rooms were well maintained. We stayed two different times during our trip to Greece. Once in a standard suite and another time in an executive suite. Both had comfortable beds and all the amenities including a full kitchen with refrigerator. The bathroom was well equipped with great task lighting. The windows were triple paned so the rooms were very quiet and conducive for sleeping. The breakfast buffet was ample and requests from staff were met with a smile. I highly recommend this hotel if you plan to travel to Athens.,1
"The location of this hotel offers easy access to many of the fabulous sights Athens has to offer including the Acropolis, Syntagma Square, the Ancient and Roman Agoras, and the new Acropolis Museum to name just a few. All of these are within an easy 10-20 minute walk. The hotel is at the base of the Plaka neighborhood which is a lively tourist destination with lots of restaurants and shops. It offers all the typical amenities of a 3-4 star facility including a breakfast buffet that costs 15 euro per person extra. I found this to be excessive and also thought the room rate somewhat high. However, on balance the hotel was considered a good find and I have no hesitation in recommending it to visitors. It is convenient to a stop for one of the many hop on hop off buses that tour the city. Access to the Acropolis, which I considered to be the most significant historical site, is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel.",0
"Spacious, balcony, clean, great views (Temple of Zeus), walking distance to all of the ruins - right below the Acropolis. Friendly service. Order the bubbles and fruit plate to be waiting for your arrival.",0
"Great room, really comfortable, unbelievably convenient to ancient city and historical precinct. Service via internet beforehand was really good, with very friendly welcome. Breakfast in hotel was delicious with wide choice   Room Tip: Great view from rooms over street with Hadrian's arch almost within touching distance See more room tips",1
"Actually it is not! We visited Athens two years ago and stayed in AVA hotel after finding it on TripAdvisor. It is set in wonderful Plaka location, great people, clean well sized rooms, surprisingly great breakfast. Got great tips from personnel where to dine nearby. All you need is at your finger tips. Walk to Acropolis, other historic sites and nearby museums. Have a joy in buying the best olives and feta cheese at Athens market place about 15min walk from the hotel to complement champagne you received on arrival. Preserved sardines, as well? We are considering return next year and we will call AVA. It is not the cheapest place but for a short stay it seems perfect.There is an hour drive from Airport to the last station and 15min walking to the hotel. Not bad for 5EUROs. Buses run 24/7.   Room Tip: Get the room with a street view, level 2 or 3 See more room tips",1
"This is the second time we've stayed at The AVA. Each time the hotel staff were engaging, helpful and pleasant. The hotel is beautiful and well kept from all angles. The location couldn't be better, especially if you're interested in the Acropolis. The location is centrally located enough that we could walk to the Archeological Museum and 2-3 blocks to the entrance of the Acropolis. The breakfast was excellent by any standard and included choices for everyone. Next time in Athens we'll be staying at The AVA.   Room Tip: There is one room on the ground floor, with a good sized patio several times the size of the upper f... See more room tips",0
This hotel is ideally located near all the main sites and is very comfortable and modern. The young staff are very friendly and really wanted everything to be perfect for us. The breakfast buffet is amazing - one of the best I've ever had in Europe.,2
"We had a lovely time here. You could not ask for a better location. You can walk out the front door to everything...cafes,Acropolis,Hadrians Gate and shops. The Plaka is right there. We walked to everything including the metro. We were there when Athens shut down the airport for a day. The staff was very helpful to help us with reorganizing our flight to Israel. The breakfast is very good and overall I rate this hotel top of the list for most everything you would want. In addition, very large rooms.",1
The location of AVA if you are in Athens to see the sights could not be better. You can walk to all the great sights. The acropolis view was a bit of a let down as it's the back view that you get from the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. We liked it so much that we went back a few days later for our last night in Greece after traveling to the islands. Excellent breakfast and efficient cleaning. Can both recommend and consider it again for my next visit to Athens.,3
"This lovely boutique hotel is in a prime location. Walking distance to the Acropolis, Hadrian's Gate and a few other tourist locations. Plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance, plus all the souvenir shops are in the area too.The rooms are beautifully done up, with loads of space. The kitchenette is well-equipped. The briefing given by the staff upon check-in was impeccable - they certainly know what travellers need to know! Very helpful.We did not try the breakfast buffet as we found it was too expensive, and online reviews suggested that the price was not worth it for the food provided. However, it is easy enough to buy some breakfast supplies at a nearby minimart or to have breakfast at one of the local cafes.",2
"This Hotel was perfect for my family of four. It is right in the centre of Plaka, with plenty of shopping and restaurants surrounding the hotel. It is also really close to the Acropolis Museum, and one of the main entry points for the Acropolis. The room was big enough for all four us. The room had a kitchen and because of the location of the hotel, it allowed us to come back for a quick, inexpensive lunch and rest during the day.   Room Tip: The best rooms are on level 3 as they have the largest balconies. See more room tips",1
There is a reason this hotel is rated so high on tripadvisor. It is at a great location in the Plaka area with most of the tourist sites within walking distance. Lot of restaurants within 5 mins walk (in any direction). The staff was very helpful in giving directions or making dinner reservations or just suggesting places. Would definitely stay here again if I get a chance.,3
"We stayed at the AVA Hotel for several days while in Athens on vacation. It was the perfect choice!!!! The location is excellent as you are literally a block away from the beginnings of the Plaka! The staff of the hotel is first rate and service oriented. Dimetria and Andrea were the staff we had the most contact with. They were both helpful and knowledgeable about the surroundings for shopping, food, and tourist attractions. The hotel itself is excellent! Clean, spacious, and accommodating. You can start your day with a breakfast buffet that has many hot and cold selections. If you need to be near the Plaka for business or are a tourist, this is the place!!   Room Tip: Rooms over the entrance and lobby allowed you to look at ancient ruins in either direction. See more room tips",3
"We had only a one night stop over in Athens and picked this hotel from TA. They arranged transfer to the hotel from the airport, which is very helpful. We had a twin room as requested. Bedroom is a good size, as is the bathroom. Even has a decent kitchenette. There is also a plethora of DVDs available (in English) - but we didn't have time. The hotel is close to the Acropolis and Parliament (you must go and watch the changing of the guards - every hour on the hour). The day we left, there was a taxi strike and we were facing dragging our suitcases on the train, but they managed to work out a way to get us there. Thank goodness. Even though our stay was short, it was perfect for our needs. Thanks to the staff for all their help.",0
"The location was perfect, very near the tourist sites and within easy walking distance of Syntagma Square for transport to the airport. The staff were very polite and helpful at all times. The room was very clean and breakfast was excellent.",1
"What a fabulous location just by the Acropolis and in the middle of the Plaka. We could drop in and out of sightseeing and were walking distance from bars, shops and sites. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the room was well equipped and clean with a Lovely courtyard.",0
"Lovely large suite and good for the family. Of course you pay more if more guests occupy. Nice location to explore athens from, being SO close to the acropolis. The acropolis view was a bit of a let down as it's the back view that you get from the hotel. Staff are quite friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good.",0
"I cannot imagine a better spot for a hotel in Athens. From our balcony looking left was Hadrian's Arch and looking right the base of the Acropolis. And it's not just the location. The executive suite was spacious, beautifully decorated with very comfortable beds (The bathroom was well appointed but somewhat small without a tub). The service at the hotel was faultless and the car and driver Yanis, they set up for us was excellent. They advertise as a 4-star hotel, but they are better than a lot of 5-star hotels I have stayed at.",1
"This is not an inexpensive hotel mainly because of its location ( =not only heart of the centre but also os Acropolis area ) but also due to its status as well. I had a German friend visiting Athens who wanted to enjoy kitchenette facilities and parking in a quality very central but small size hotel, I proposed AVA and she was more excited , than what I was expecting her to be , with everything there.",0
"We had a wonderful stay at AVA Hotel. Wish we stayed longer at this hotel! As soon as we checked into our room we had a chilled bottle of Greek wine and a lovely welcoming note waiting for us in our room. It was fabulous and added to our experience in Athens! Our room was spacious and had a kitchenette. The view from our room was of the street below us, which was fine because we explored outside most of the time. The location of our hotel is perfect. Close to everything...shopping, food, Acropolis etc. Staff was so nice and helpful. It rained one day and they provided us with umbrellas, maps, and great suggestions for places to eat.",0
"This place is a lovely hotel in the middle of all the sights with wonderful staff. The rooms are very comfortable with a lot of amenities, wonderful to relax on the sofa or the balcony with the views of Acropolis. The staff are very knowledgeable and can recommend good local restaurants or give directions for sights. Stayed in room 202",1
"Our visit to Athens was a dream trip thanks in large part to Ava's manager Maria Kokkori and her very helpful staff. The hotel lived up to it's high ratings and Trip Advisor reviews.  The location is superb, quiet and a five minute walk from the subway. We had a comfortable suite with a living area and bedroom with a small balcony. The view of the Acropolis is stunning -- and just out the front door if you don't have it from your room. The kitchenette was a real plus.  The neighborhood is in the heart of ancient Athens. Everything you could want is in easy reach -- restaurants, small bakeries, bistros, and grocery shops where you can easily get your own breakfast and snacks.  But the secret sauce for Hotel Ava is the staff. Their knowledgable advice really helped us get the most out of our Greek experience.  It started when we arrived and were offered the chance to enjoy classic movies filmed in or about Greece from the DVD library available to their guests.  We especially appreciated the courtesy guide books they provided in our room on Greek antiquities, history and myths.  My husband and I enjoy walking so they gave us a map and advice on the best walking tour routes for seeing the sights.  When we wanted a guide they helped us arrange top-notch tours of Athens and the Acropolis. They were always interested to hear where we were eating and what we found interesting to help them in advising other guests. When our plans to rent a car for several days in the Peloponnese proved impractical they adjusted our reservation dates and helped us arrange and excellent small group tour. We especially appreciate how their efforts t be flexible and make us feel at home. This will be our go-to hotel in Athens when we are lucky enough to return.",4
"The hotel is located in a perfect place. Easy access to restaurants, markets and sights. The staff at the hotel really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and their advice was priceless! The rooms were clean and spacious. However, the internet was poor and sometimes a bit frustrating. Although, definitely value for money!",1
"The hotel is fine, well positioned in Plaka. The staff is very friendly. Rooms are spacious and clean. Breakfast is below average and internet is poor. No restaurant in the hotel (you can have breakfast). In the area you'll find many restaurants but be aware, they focus on tourists.",3
"We enjoyed staying at the AVA Hotel - the location in the Plaka, looking at the back side of the Acropolis and at Hadrian's gate and the Temple of Zeus, is amazing. We had an exclusive suite, which was truly enormous, with a large terrace overlooking the Acropolis and Temple of Zeus, and we enjoyed sitting outside enjoying the views. The beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean. We received bottles of sparkling wine on arrival, which we really enjoyed. Three negatives that keep it from being a perfect experience: (1) the staff are responsive and professional, but not nearly as warm and kind as at every other hotel we stayed at in Greece, (2) the wifi is free but incredibly slow from the higher floors, and (3) the incremental cost of breakfast is quite high, like a big chain hotel rather than a small boutique hotel.   Room Tip: Exclusive suites on the third floor have a huge terrace with wonderful views See more room tips",4
"Spent 8 nights in this hotel in Glyfada. Location is excellent, walking distance from nightlife in Glyfada, 5 minutes walk to the nearest tram station (45 mins to Athens Syntagma) and a quick taxi drive to the nearest subway station; from there it's only 15-20 minutes to Syntagma Square. The beach is nearby too, no more than 10 minutes walk. A taxi from the hotel to Athens city centre is also possible for approx. 15 euros (meter) or 25 euros (late night).Service in this hotel is outstanding - very helpful with planning daytrips and supplying early breakfast if necessary. Friendly and attentive staff, made us feel very welcome from the start, and were helpful throughout! Excellent job.Rooms are spacious and each room has its own wifi network, which is a plus.Would certainly highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice mix of culture and beach/nightlife.",1
"Small boutique hotel with very clean suites , great for traveling with families . Eager to service all our needs at all times , charming breakfast area and only a short distance to the shopping / restaurant district of Glyfada .We will be back for sure !",1
"Lovely peaceful location with everything within walking distance...beach, shops (good selection of upmarket options Inc. MAC, Sephora, Guy Laroche, small Hondos Centre Department store with good brands), restaurants, bars, supermarket. The pool area is so lovely couldn't see any point in going to the beach - very busy road to cross to get there anyway. Nice facilities with loungers, umbrellas and a bar/restaurant at the nearest beach though. Air conditioning in the apartments is a blessing on the hotter days. The tram into central Athens is at the end of the street. Wanted to have a relaxing break and it was exactly that. Great team at the Brasil Suites, nothing was too much trouble. Thanks to Corina, Paulo and staff   Room Tip: Local restaurant Tsi Tsi is a great local find. See more room tips",1
"Because of my job(flight attendant) I've visited a lot of hotels around the world.The quite environment, the elegant decor,spacious and cozy suites ,the perfect location,the friendly and professional stuff ,the amazing breakfast and all the tasty dishes they serve contribute to the most unforgettable experience ever in a hotel.Definitely coming back!",3
"We had the pleasure of staying at the Brasil with our family of 4. The rooms are very spacious, modern, and very clean. The veranda was also a great space to lounge in at the end of the day, overlooking the pool. We were very comfortable. Breakfast is included and there are numerous options for every taste. The food is delicious and plentiful. Corina and Anna Maria, at the reception desk, are very warm and helpful. We would not hesitate in staying again. In fact, we have already booked another stay at the Brasil. We highly recommend! Excellent hotel!",2
"A cool ""apartment style"" hotel. Personal and yet private. Prices tend to be higher, but if no issue, a cool small hotel to rest and romance you partner. A nice small restaurant / cafe downstairs if needed for a smoke break. Staff is helpful not intrusive.",0
"We visited this hotel again and found the experience to be just as good as last time. The rooms are nice and the staff is very attentive, warm and friendly. It is a small hotel but all needs are catered to and the location is good.",1
Our room was very well maintained and after almost 24 hours of traveling it was great to arrive and already have the sofa bed made up for our very tired children.The staff here were super helpful and very friendly and made us feel very welcome indeed.Breakfasts were great as were the pool and drinks and snacks service by the pool.Centrally located with not even a 5 minute walk to great eateries in Glyfada. I would definitely recommend and stay here again!,0
"Nice modern looking block with very approachable staff that made time to ensure guests enjoyed their stay. Comfortable room/apartment and we loved the recessed lighting arrangements, beautiful and stylish.Huge choice of nice restaurants on the nearby main street (Leof. Dimarchou Aggelou Metaxa)Only negative is that there is no dedicated parking arrangements so guests are advised to just find some on-street parking in the immediate area.",1
"Amazing hotel in the heart of glyfada, close to shops, amazing bars and restaurants and ofcourse the beach. The service from corina and her staff is amazing. The rooms are actually amazing none of the photos on here do them justice. Would highly recommend to all, P.s make sure you try their cheeseburgers, I would go back just for that alone haha.",2
"This hotel came highly recommended and nothing about it disappointed me. The owner and staff are professionally friendly and very welcoming. The suits are spacious and full of brightness. They are beautifully decorated and well maintained. We particularly enjoyed the large balcony, lounging in the outdoor seating, sipping our local Greek wine. The buffet breakfast was excellent. Very well located. Around five minute walk to beach and the local Glyfada restaurants, shops and tram. The tram connects you to Athens city and Attica. Like the lyrics of 'The White Rose of Athens' we will return to bring the summer to our hearts.' Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend taking the local bus to Legranade beach Sounio for the day. You can then take the path up the side of the hill for the sunset at the Temple of Poseidon. The bus leaves Athens on the hour and you can pick it up on the half hour or a little later from Glyfada opposite side of highway, opposite McDonalds. The trip is 1 hour and €6. We ate a lot at  Restaurant Barbounaki - delicious. The Astir Palace Resort could learn a lesson on customer care from this establishment.",3
"What a brilliant place to stay. The service and hospitality from Paulo and his staff was totally amazing. We had contact prior to arriving and Paulo helped us out with transport arrangements from the port to Brasil Suites. When we arrived our room was ready and we chilled out by the pool for a bit (before hitting the beach). We were given fresh chilled water and cakes by the pool, it's the small things that count as well as the helpful recommendations of where to go to the beach and eat.The apartment (and rest of the hotel) was just beautiful, the fresh aroma as soon as you walk in through the door, to the best toiletries I have ever smelt and indeed used (O.live) - just fabulous. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the linen was soft, bright white and lovely.To top of our stay was the delicious breakfast - freshly cooked breads, cakes and other wonderful delights was divine and the perfect way to end our stay. We just wish we could have stayed longer. Just awesome",1
"This is not your typical hotel. If you are coming from the US this is similar to a boutique hotel, but I would say this is even more boutique than what we are used to. It's small, not located in downtown Athens and nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood. All of things are great if you are looking for a very relaxing, quiet stay. The staff and service were top notch. Rooms were great, very open and airy. Pool was nice(only used once since it was mid may and not entirely pool weather. One of the best parts is the location. It is a 2 minute walk from the main strip of shops, cafe's, etc in downtown Glyfada. It was a five minute walk from the ocean and maybe 10 minutes from the nearest beach. Loved all of this, staying there a week you could hit a different cafe every day/night and not run out of new places.",1
They are at least trying to be the best by providing the best services. The are is quite and nice shopping area. The WiFi is very good and they provide free tea and nescafe. Nesspresso is not free and no free water.,1
"Stayed with my wife for 4 nights in early May 2016, in a junior suite.Top quality hotel, you get what you pay for. Overall the best level of service and attention to detail of all places we've stayed at, home and abroad. Spotlessly clean throughout, large suite and well appointed kitchen. Reception staff spoke excellent English, and were able to give us some valuable advice when the trams were on strike, and of local restaurants to go to (I can recommend Pasifai in Glyfada)We deliberately chose to stay in Glyfada to be nearer the airport (25mins in a cab) and the beach (5 min walk). Athens city centre can be reached in 45 mins on the tram (tram stop is 200 yards from hotel and only costs €1.40 - compare that to London!). Finally, a thumbs up for the airport who only charge €0.35 for a bottle of mineral water !",2
"A hidden little gem very central in Glyfada. Short walking to all restaurants.The staff is so friendly and service minded. Always helpful and attentive. Rooms are very clean and with balconies, separate bedroom and nice kitchen,",1
"This hotel is an amazing boutique hotel experience. The staff are extremely friendly and very accommodating. We require a very late checkin (1am) and late checkout, which was easily accommodated.The breakfast is sublime. Everything was amazing.",1
"Well placed for restaurants and the tram, with stylish contemporary design, this little hotel had large,well- appointed rooms and staff who couldn't do more to make our stay good. The front desk recommended restaurants ( good greek food and not expensive), organised car hire, and offered us free beach towels when we headed out for a day along the coast. Breakfasts were excellent, too. Good value for money.",1
"The Brasil Suites Hotel is one of the nicest hostelries I have stayed in. A good location in the resort of Glyfada on the Aegean coast near Athens. Pristinely clean, with everything you need to enjoy your holiday. Management are very friendly and professional and the staff follow suit. Nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast superb. Rooms comfortable and well structured. Small pool but very nice chlorine free water. My partner Rosemary and I will be back. Soon!   Room Tip: Ground floor rooms would suit small children and disabled people. See more room tips",0
It was a small hotel but comfortable...may be you can find better ones but costing more...and the employee very helpful and caring...athens was so beautiful I think I might come back again..I recommend this place to all my friends visiting athens...,1
Brasil was recommended by a friend. I visited Greece many times and very much impressed by the people's hospitality . In this small hotel I was well treated as I never had in the best five star hotels I visited all the world around.It is the home feeling given by the hotel staff.I do not hesitate to recommend it to any Greece visitor.,1
"We checked in for a short break first week in March. I have traveled a lot and I have to say the best service I have received by far. From the team on reception, Julia behind the bar and the housekeeping team, we thought you were great. The area is amazing, friendly and everything you could want for a short break. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Greece. We will be returning in a few weeks we loved it so much. Thanks a lot, IIan & David",1
"A small hotel centrally located in Glyfada. It is a 3 minutes walk to the closest tram station, and a 3 minute walk to the tavernas and cafes of Glyfada.The hotel is clean and comfortable with kitchenettes in every room. It offers an amazing breakfast and great in-room dining options.Staff and on top of it, and are most attentive to any request.For my stays in Glyfada, this is the place.",1

Very clean environment , located very convenient to all local shops and cafes it was such a pleasure to stay here !! We will be back!! :)   Room Tip: Back rooms have great view of the pool!

"This is a small hotel in the glamorous upmarket Athens port of Glyfada. The hotel reception welcome you warmly and sincerely. They are very knowledgable and nothing is too much trouble. We stayed in the junior suite it was modern with nice decor and had every provision we could possibly need.Examples of the staff exceeding expectations are:Having free hot drinks and cake in the barPool towels and drinks arriving at our table within just a couple of minutes of requestAdvising on days out and researching local go karting options for my family.Coming straight up to the room when I didn't know how to work the DVD Cooking my teenage son fresh omelette and bacon for breakfast, despite there being an already fantastic breakfast buffet choice already laid out.Bathroom toiletries replaced every dayThe best room cleaners, I have ever come across in a hotel, absolutely perfect and precise attention to every detail.Over our 5 night stay the whole team running this hotel were absolutely faultless, it is a tightly run ship and you they will ensure your stay is comfortable, nothing is too much trouble for them, you will feel like a king/queen!",4
We 've stayed for three nights. The Suite is spacious and beautiful with a big kitchen which was very helpful. The balcony was nice with a nice view. Breakfast was tasty. Good location and quiet place. I totally recommend it.,1
"We lived in Glyfada for 13 years. The last 2 years we are living abroad. We are visiting our home country 2-3 times per year. This time we decided to stay in a hotel in our old neighborhood for our 12 days holidays. It was a great idea!The hotel is exceptional! The service was great, the people working there very polite and they were all trying to help with anything we might need. The design of the hotel is modern and minimal and it makes you feel so relaxed. The room was sunny and quite, spacious and well equipped. The breakfast was delicious!Traveling with two children 10 and 12 years old it can be really challenging. But in our case, even the kids were feeling at home in this hotel. And this feeling is priceless !!!Thank you very much Paul! You and your team are doing an excellent job, keep on!!!We will see you again, Best regards, Mara",2
"I do not usually write reviews knowing that evaluations are inevitably subjective in nature. However, Brasil Suites is simply exceptionally excellent that its virtue could be universal. The room (Junior Suite) was spacious, well-equipped, spotless, quiet, with a great bed and working space. Simply put, it's like you are in your appartment with a delightful team of housekeeping and sincere advisors/concierges with rich knowledge of restaurants, shops, transport, etc. A nice supermarket, greek restaurant, fish restaurant, all in a walking distance an extra plus. I have absolutely nothing negative to say, but as I don't trust reveiws with positive comments only, here we go. Bigger mugs in a room would have been nice (though I'm sure if we asked, they would have found some for us; we simply didn't). It's true that Athens is a bit far (almost an hour by the tram) but easy enough to reach; so if your holiday is short and the objective is to visit all the famous spots in Athens, this is not the place. I can't write on the beach as we were there in winter. I will surely come back (I tried to make a reservation for the next holiday but was stopped by my husband saying the world is not so sure...)",3
"When you come in to the hotel you'd think it is brand new building, I think they had completed renovation recently. The designer did a fine job. The ambiance is so relaxing and the modern style is spot on. The location could not have been any better, close to every thing in Glyfada but away from the noisy streets. The room it self is a spacious one bedroom apartment with a full kitchen. It has an espresso machine, dvd player and much more.The breakfast food area is small, nevertheless it is has more options than some 5 stars hotel and a lot of healthy options including fresh fruits. The room service menu had so many tasty options. Finally, the staff were another highlight of the many good things about this hotel. Very warm and helpful and run the Extra mile to accommodate the guest request.",1
"Rooms are very spacious, clean and well equipped.Breakfast is also very nice and the staff are making you feel very welcome.Location is in the center of Glyfada, meaning walking distance to restaurants, cafees, shopping and also the beach.",2
"Spent four days there, and it was a pleasure to stay, to say the least. Great beds, rooms has everything you need, very service minded staff, place is clean, great location - all in all a no brainer pick, if you are going to stay in Glyfada. I would be pleased to go stay there again.",0
"I booked the hotel Brasil Suite based solely on pictures and of course location. When we arrived a hotel member came to the Taxi to greet us, check in was a breeze, (and their English is excellent) We went to our suite and opened the door and our jaw dropped. It was exquiste, all marble and tiles with a beautiful deck, 3 rooms of beauty. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever been in while travelling. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The continental breakfast has a vast selection. The neighborhood is very safe and restaurants and shopping are just around the corner and within a comfortable walking distance for 2 senior citizens. If I return to Greece I will stay there again. I just can't say enough good things about the Brasil. Thanks to Paula and her staff it was wonderful.",2
"great service, helpful friendly amazing staff...close to a very nice neighborhood close by the sea side . The staff will help you go around the city,, you can take a tram and go almost anywhere around Athens buses are also very accessible around the area...",2
"My partner and I simply loved this property out of the main stream of downtown Athens. Easy tram ride to the heart of thing. Gylfada is great abundance of shopping, beaches and bars and restaurants. The hotel is family owned and they cater to every detail. They had our laundry cleaned and ready to go for our next journey to Istanbul. We will definitely be back. Loved the area and loved Athens.",3
Great hotel. Lovely and posh area of Glyfada Athens. Lovely people at the hotel. Excellent food. Overall great experience will surely visit and stay at the same place again. As I had a lovely time and stay,1
3 of us stayed four nights. Woke up to a hearty selection of breakfast every morning and always greeted by the warm and helpful staff. Clean and great amenities (loved their shampoo!). The kitchen had everything you need as a traveler. The location couldn't have been better being in the streets rather than on the main road. Walking distance to great restaurants and shops yet away from the noise as Glyfada bars can be pumping music untill 4-6am! Thank you for the lovely stay and we will be back for sure!,2
This was our first trip to Greece. We stayed at this lovely suites and enjoyed every minute of it. Hotel is on point and customer service is excellent. Spacious and lovely rooms. We (myself and my sisters) fell in love with the staff. Food is great and we cannot wait to visit again.,1
"We are a family of four (with two teenagers) and we have an apartment at this hotel. The reception and in particular the main manager is so helpful (he could not help us enough). Suggested a place to park our car in the centre of Athens and said to call him if we have problems. The staff are all really friendly and accommodating, They are happy to call/book and recommend restaurants. Our flight is not until late tomorrow and they said we can check out as late as 5pm with no extra cost. The breakfast is amazing, the apartments are extremely clean. It truly is a great place to stay, and we have not even discovered the lovely looking Glyfada yet. (to be discovered tomorrow) I would definitely come back here again!! Not sure, but feel like a family run hotel, with the extras such as 24 hours free hot drinks and marble cake, as well as Ouzo!",3
"My husband and I have traveled to Greece on more than one occasion but usually have stayed in Athens as my husband is doing business in Athens and the surrounding local areas. This time we chose to be in Glyfada and this was our first experience there and at Brasil Suites. From the moment we arrived we were delighted by everything. We were greeted warmly and assisted to our suite along with our luggage. We opened the door to find a beautifully appointed suite with living room, kitchen, bedroom, bath and balcony and a welcome drink for two was waiting for us. The suite is spacious and well appointed. Very comfortable with plenty of space to accommodate your belongings instead of living out of a suitcase. There are 2 TV's, DVD player, CD player, iron and ironing board in the room as well as laundry service available, coffee, tea in room with an electric pot that was very fast and used daily. The balcony had a small table and chairs as well as a large comfortable chair to relax in. I spent a lot of time out there while my husband was on business reading, doing paperwork and knitting. The cool breeze on a warm day was There are spa robes and slippers in the bedroom and spa services are available to purchase although we did not do so. The complimentary breakfast is plentiful and delicious with both hot and cold offerings as well a daily assortment of breads and pastries that were delicious. The staff is simply amazing. They are warm and friendly, speak great English and are always available to assist you and attend to your every need. You never feel like you are a bother, instead you are treated like family which is so pleasant when you are away from home. I felt safe and comfortable at all times. The beach is close by, there is a beautiful pool at the hotel, shopping and restaurants are abundant and the tram is one block away which will take you right into Atens. There are even umbrellas in the lobby if it is raining. We left in the very early morning for the airport and a continental breakfast had been prepared for us before we left. This for sure is ""our"" hotel. It will be our home away from home.",2
"My first trip to Greece and the stay at Brasil Suites was very enjoyable. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Very restful round the pool and the staff brought cold water, complimentary fresh fruit and were most attentive. We found plenty of good restaurants near bye and the tram system was easy to understand and use",1
"Hotel Brasil is a great place to stay if you are visiting Athens. You are conveniently located to the beaches, shopping, restaurants, and the tram station. You can ride the tram into Athens Center (Acropolis, etc) for 1.20 euros. The service at this hotel is way above what you might expect. If you tell them what you want they will try their best to accommodate you. The rooms were nice and spacious with generous balconies. I would definitely recommend this hotel.   Room Tip: I preferred the room on the upper floors with a balcony. See more room tips",1
"We used Uber from airport to hotel approx 30mins & costs 27€.We had a jr suit which was perfect for 3 of us (2adults & toddler) there is a big balcony for little one to run around, kitchen needed a few more utensils but other than that, apartment was perfect & clean.Breakfast was good, the juices were freshly squeezed & they were so accommodating allowing us to take breakfast to room as it was easier for my toddler. Location is great, quite neighbourhood & walking distance to the town with good restaruants, shopping & kids playground.We were close to Athens as well as the lake and beach so it was all good! Would definitely recommend.",0
"We had the most lovely stay in Glyfada and our accommodation at the Brasil Suites absolutely added to our trip. Firstly the warm greetings that you receive from the staff morning, afternoon and in the evening make you feel totally comfortable and welcomed within the environment. The staff are all well informed and can advise about tourist sites, beaches and restaurants to suit your needs. The daily buffet breakfast is superb with a wide choice to select from offering cold and hot dishes ready for you in a relaxed environment. If you don't fancy a trip to the beach you can opt to sit, take a dip and relax by the pool. The suites are spot on decorated in a modern and tasteful way with all your needs covered with a lovely bathroom, lounge and kitchen area and lovely bedrooms. All the restaurants and bars of Glyfada are within a couple of minutes walking distance as are the beaches giving a great balance of beach and city life. Highly recommend the Brasil suites if you are looking for a very well done modern suite. I would definitely stay again and would love to see all the staff again.",1
"My husband and I spent 10 days in this charming boutique hotel near the sea in order to attend a greek family reunion held locally.It was important to communicate easily with family members so the perfect WiFi service (no password nonsense) was most helpful.I agree with the accolades from other guests regarding the service from reception and bar staff and the immaculate condition of everything .The ethos of the reception staff is to ensure that everyone has the best time and there is a warm,friendly and informal atmosphere. All accommodation is spacious light and airy and the unusual modernist design by Brasilian architects pleasing to the eye. The breakfast is healthy with lots of choice. In short it would be difficult not to have a good time at this hotel   Room Tip: Better views on higher floors See more room tips",3
"Four of us, plus a small boy, stayed in this hotel in one Senior suite and all of us were very happy and pleased. Hotel itself is built with really taste. Room and hotel facilities are very well equiped and clean. Served brakfest is very good, decent choice of all kinds of foodstuffs. Location is also perfect, close to the beach, near very good restaurants and bars.The most important in this hotel is its personel. Very nice, very friedly, very helpful, really profesional...We can say only THANK YOU!!",2
"I stayed at the Brasil at the beginning of August 2015 for x 4 days, and at the end of August 2015 for x 5 days. I cannot rate highly how well this property is cared for, and attention to detail included. The beautiful Korrs Products in the bathroom are a lovely classy touch. Pavlos and Corinna do an amazing job at front of desk, to welcome you to the Hotel. Breakfast is just enough in a lovely glass room at front of hotel, and with a nice array of various cereals, breads, condiments, juices and pastries etc.The shops are one block away and into the main street you have at your disposal, all the taverna's, bars, shops, coffee places and the like.There is a lovely well maintained pool area at the back of the property which is lovely, and lit up at night. I often sat on the balcony watching the lights from the apartments in the distance, or the pool area, with a glass of bubbly. It was perfect.I used to look forward to coming back from shopping and an evening out and being greeted by Christopher the cat, and his sister on the front of the lovely well kept grass area. I even treated them both left overs from Souvlaki Taverna 'Lemoni one night.I did not want to leave at the end of my stay, but am happy to know that I will be back to see Pavlos and Corinna & Christopher and his sister in the future. When you leave you feel like you are leaving great friends behind. Cannot wait to go back :D   Room Tip: All upper rooms with view are perfect. See more room tips",2
"The apartment is very impressive, well designed and furnished. Also very clean and includes 2 TV, stereo sound system, two bath robe, kitchen tools.We enjoyed our stay very much especially from the swimming pool.People from the hotel management are very nice,trying to help in everything they can.I strongly recommend this place. Although it is not a cheaper hotel it worths the money. Enjoy.",3
"We recently stayed in Brasil suites with our children (and my parents had another suite too) and it was perfect. Great location, the friendliest of staff, clean and tidy rooms - a perfect boutique size hotel. Paulo is helpful, friendly and ray of sunshine when it comes to customer service. Other hotels would benefit from learning a thing or two from this exceptional hotel. Thank you Brasil suites I hope we get to come back and visit you again (I know my parents will)!   Room Tip: I'm sure they are all good! See more room tips",2
"I visited this hotel with my family in August 2015. We chose it as our last hotel accommodation in Greece before departing for back home (Australia) and we are so glad we did. You could walk to the retail centre of Glyfada from this hotel, with many restaurants, cafes and shops to choose from. There was ample street parking either immediately outside or within 50m of the hotel at the time we visited. The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming and provided towels for our trips to the beach (there is also a hotel pool). Would stay here again. The suburb of Glyfada is a great base from which to explore Athens and the location of the hotel, whilst central was located in a quiet street. A tram to the city was a short walk away. Fantastic stay with the most spacious rooms that we encountered in Greece!",4
"We stayed at Brasil Suites for 10 days. Corrina, Paulo and their staff are perfect hosts, they make you feel Brasil Suites is your home. The appartment and its surroundings with pool are very nice and its situated in the end of main-street i Glyfada next to many tavernas, restaurants and shopping (many great restaurant i Glyfada with good service and ""quality-food""). We stayed a Junior Suite for 3 days and Family Suite for 7 days, both rooms is nice and clean and have a lovely balcony. We loved the breakfast with frech fruites , juices and good variation bread, pasties, egg ,bacon ........ Its easy going to Athens, the train station (tram) is a 3 min walk away and its 40 min by train (4 Euro per adult) or 20 min by Taxi , 15-20 Euro). Brasil Suites suits us perfect with everything we need nearby (walkingdistance). Love this hotelBjornar Lodoen",3
"Having visited Glyfada and surrounding area for many years (mainly given that my uncle lives there), we were looking for another hotel that could accommodate not only my wife and daughter, but also my 3.5 year old son as well. The accommodation was fantastic and was more than comfortable the four of us. The spacious balcony proved to be valuable also whilst the kids were asleep - something I'm sure is a must for many parents with younger children. The pool area was very nice with great sun chairs and lounges (something I wouldn't normally comment on). Convenient and clean pool-side toilets and showers. Breakfast was very nice also with a and although not as extensive as that of large hotels, was of good quality. Fantastic location in terms of access to the excellent beaches, shops, restaurants and bars of Glyfada (and Vouliagmenis which we also frequented for the beach) as well as the convenient team that runs from Glyfada to either Voula or Athens. Best of all though were the lovely and very welcoming staff that went out of their way to ensure our stay was as comfortable and stress free! We left something of very low value (and quite replaceable) in our room - I am now reliably informed that it's been out put in the post to our home in the UK. We will definitely be returning for future visits! A great stay!",0
"Brasil Suites is the perfect hotel to visit Athens. Away from the crowds and the bad air, Glyfada is quiet, has some nice restaurant and both the tram and the metro to go to Athens. The hotel itself is quiet, clean and spacious. The pool is small, but prefect for a quick dip after a day in Athens. However, if you ask me, the music at the pool doesn't have to be this loud. The management of the hotel is very friendly and helpful. Our room, on the ground floor, was spacious and comfortable. Last but bot least, the breakfast was one the best ever. Everything fresh, including the OJ, and lots of choice.",1
"I have stayed at Brasil Suites 3 times previously and i can unquestionably say that this place is run by the best in the business. The surrounding grounds and pool area are an oasis in the suburb of Glyfada, the rooms are perfectly decorated and super clean. Paulo and Corrina are the perfect hosts, while their staff are friendly and cannot be faulted. I love waking up for the breakfasts and my morning frappe. Centrally located in Glyfada next to many great tavernas and restaurants and also importantly....shopping. If you want to go swimming in Athens, great beaches nearby, and even better ones a little further away by car. Looking forward to our return stay before going back home. Love this place!",1
"This immaculate property is located a street or so away from the centre of Glyfada (suburb of Athens) and local beaches. We booked following a recommendation and we were not disappointed. We were met by the charming Paolo who quickly made us feel very welcome. The Junior suite was spacious and luxurious, well above our expectations. The location is perfect, a short walk to at least 3 very good restaurants and much more just a little further away. We walked to the beach too! Access to central Athens by tram is also convenient. An amazing breakfast awaits you in the morning (anywhere else in the world we would be charged at least 30 euros each for such delights!). We can only say, a highly professional group of staff and luxurious amenities make this hotel one we will revisit again.",1
"First class hotel, loved staying here. Breakfast was fabulous: tasty selection of food, great presentation (loved the Greek salad in a jar). Staff attentive and helpful, room clean and comfortable. Delightful experience, defn would come again",1
"I I booked a suite at Brasil Suites for the first night of my honeymoon. The reviews were great and I assumed that nothing could go wrong … After all, this was the #1 rated hotel in the city I was staying in.I arrive to the hotel and was greeted by the owners. They advised that my room was not yet ready because the person staying in my particular room had a medical emergency in the hotel and needed to be taken to the hospital (already I’m wondering what is going on that people staying here had a medical emergency on the property that led to having to be admitted into a local hospital and staying overnight).They suggested that I go out on my already booked tour of Athens and when I come back in a few hours my room will be ready. We went on the tour and returned to Brasil Suites 5 hours later. When we returned, the owners who originally greeted me and assured that I would be taken care of were no longer there. The guy behind the desk told me that my room was still not ready and so they booked me at another hotel in the area, a hotel that they chose without consulting me.Without asking me which hotel I’d like to stay in, they booked me in the #8 rated hotel in the area (keep in mind I originally intended to stay at the #1 hotel, so this was quite a drop off). I asked why I did not have a choice of the hotel I was being put in and they simply told me this is how it works. They keep my money and they book me in a much less expensive hotel. When a hotel has unforeseen circumstances occur, you expect to be upgraded, not downgraded but still charged full price. When I told them that I was unhappy with the hotel they moved me to, they offered to move me to another hotel, but that I would have to pay for it, even though I already paid Brasil Suites.Now, 45 days later, I am still fighting with Brasil Suites to get back the money they promised to refund to me. They are lying and saying that they have issued the credit in full, which is 100% false. I have had to get my credit card company involved and now we are going through the whole dispute process simply because this hotel refuses to refund me the money I paid to stay at a hotel I didn’t stay at.When it comes to customer service, I am hoping this review will change the way Brasil Suites operates. You do not downgrade customers due to errors on your end, and you do not LIE and state that you have credit the credit card when you have not done so. The amount of time I have had to spend fighting with these LIARS & THEIVES is not worth the amount of money I am trying to recoup, but at this point I need to leave this review so everyone else is aware of what will happen if you do business with thieves like Brasil Suites.I hope this review helps others so that you do not have your honeymoon or vacation start off on a bad note like mine did, all due to the folks at Brasil Suites not wanting to help accommodate someone with a confirmed reservation that they screwed up. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE AND DON’T EVEN PUT YOURSELF IN A SITUATION TO BE SCAMMED BY THESE CROOKS.",12
"We spent only one night at Brasil Suites and were delighted with the quality of the room, the staff and the food. Brasil suites suited us as we were in transit for one night and we did not need to be in the centre of Athens. It was perfect for us. Even if you did want to get to the centre of Athens, this is easy, for example, on the tram.",2
"When you get an amazing breakfast, you know you've made the right choice of where to stay! Our room was modern, clean and quite. I'm sure the owner is proud and he should be.

"Best hotel Ever , Brazil suites has now become our home away from home and the people are now our extended family ! From the moment you arrive , your are treated with the most amazing service and whatever your request , the people will make sure it is met .My sister and brother in law recommended Brazil suites to us as they have been coming here for the last four years twice three times a year ! And now I know why the service is 10/10 the food is 10/10 the rooms are 10/10 . We will miss Brazil suites ! I will recommend it to all look no further as you will not find a hotel that gives you the service the warmth and the hospitality that Brazil suites offers ! We will be booking to come back december and next July ! We stayed in Brazil suites 4 times throughout our stay in Greece and left our large suit cases at the hotel while we went island hopping ! from the owner of the hotel to the workers in the kitchen we will miss you guys till next time we meet again ! love from Conrad and Jenny from sydney Australia !!!

"We were in Athens for two days before heading to the islands and wanted to find a place with enough space for us and our four year old son. The hotels in downtown Athens all tend to be very small, so we decided on this hotel as although we knew that it is a bit outside of the city. The hotel is a small boutique, likely converted from an apartment building, very nice and clean, with ample space, a kitchen and a washer, which are exactly what we prefer when traveling with our son. The service is impeccable. A very nice and enjoyable pool in the back. It is an easy walk to the tram stop and many restaurants in Glyfada. The only issue it posed to us was the location. As the places we wanted to visit are all concentrated in downtown Athens, we had to commute back and forth and with a small child, it wasn't the best choice. By the time we waited for the tram and got into the city, it was easily 40-50 mins. And the tram moved rather slow and got really crowded sometimes too, so we ended up taking lots of taxi. Bearing that in mind if you are traveling with a young child and have limited time to spare.   Room Tip: high floors as the pool is on the ground See more room tips",2
"Glyfada is the Santa Monica of Athens. If you want a couple of days on the beach when visiting Athens, I'd definitely recommend coming to Glyfada and staying at Brasil Suites.This is simply one of my favorite hotels. For starters the service is incredible: the staff is so friendly and helpful. And because of the fact that this hotel only has about 15 rooms, you get a real 'home-y' feeling. The whole vibe of the hotel is very clean, modern, yet cosy and pretty. The breakfast service/buffet is great and the hotel restaurant has some excellent choices as well. If you want to relax in a smallish hotel with great service and stunning rooms, you are at the right place.   Room Tip: Rooms on the upper floors are more private. See more room tips",2
"Our first room was on the ground floor even though we had specifically requested no ground floor 10 months in advance. The first room we got had ants, sticky floors, dented furniture, used housecoats and was not prepared for us. The manager tried to convince us that there were no other suites available but eventually gave us a very nice room upstairs.   Room Tip: Do not get the ground floor. Beware of ants. See more room tips",9
"if you can stay in a suite pool side. Paulo and his team just cannot do enough to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable and they do this with absolute charm. From ensuring your fridge is stocked, recommending local restaurants, bringing food and drinks poolside. The suites are very comfortable and clean and are a very short walk from shops and beach. The perfect place whether on business or for pleasure.   Room Tip: all rooms are good but poolside is best See more room tips",2
"Stayed for two nights in June and everything was over expectation. Very nice suite, very clean and fresh. The breakfast was very good and we really enjoyed everything. Very close to the beach and also got very good recommendations at the hotel what to do and visit. The overall service was 100%!",1
"A Greek friend suggested we stay in Glyfada as it is near the beach, with good shopping and restaurants. He was right. It was a fantastic place to stay, with easy access to Athens by tram or taxi. The hotel was perfect, with a full kitchen, beautiful breakfast included and friendly helpful staff. I's love to go back one day.",1
