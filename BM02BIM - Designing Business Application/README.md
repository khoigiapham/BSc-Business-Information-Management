# Summary Business Case
## Business Needs
The report identifies a critical issue of food waste on a global scale, targeting the United Nations' goals of reducing food waste and achieving zero hunger. The Netherlands has a particularly high rate of food waste. While much focus has been on retailers, restaurants contribute a significant amount to food waste. A primary obstacle to food donation from restaurants is the cost of transportation and staff time. One solution is to incentivize restaurants to sell rather than dispose of excess food, which could also benefit consumers through discounted prices.

## Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholder analysis identifies internal and external parties such as the Management Board, Marketing and IT departments, Deliverers, Customers, and Government bodies, among others, each with varying degrees of power and interest in reducing food waste.

## Success Criteria
Key success criteria for tackling the issue include reducing excess stock and food waste in restaurants, enhancing customer satisfaction, decreasing costs, and improving financial returns. Each criterion is accompanied by a measurable goal.

## Proposed Solution
The preferred solution is to develop a platform called "ConcluDishes," aimed at connecting restaurants with surplus food to consumers who can purchase it at discounted prices. The platform is posited as a win-win for all involved, including restaurants, consumers, and even suppliers.

## Cost and Benefit Analysis
The cost analysis outlines the software development process, which is estimated to take 6 to 9 months. It provides a breakdown of costs into categories like software development, operations, infrastructure, and marketing, ranging from one-time to annual costs.
