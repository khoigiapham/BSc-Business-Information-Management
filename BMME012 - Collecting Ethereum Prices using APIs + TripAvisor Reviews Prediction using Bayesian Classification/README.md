#  Collecting Ethereum Prices using APIs üí∏üìàüîó + TripAvisor Reviews Prediction using Bayesian Classification üå¥üè®‚≠ê 

## Overview

The project comprises two main sections. The first focuses on collecting and analyzing data from APIs related to Ethereum prices. The second part deals with Bayesian Classification applied to a dataset containing TripAdvisor reviews of hotels. 

## Data Sources

1. **Ethereum Price Data**: To be collected using CoinGecko API
2. **TripAdvisor Reviews**: `data_tripadvisor.csv`

## Part 1: Collecting Data using APIs (Ethereum Prices)

- **Q1**: Use CoinGecko API to fetch the historical USD prices of Ether for the past 365 days.
- **Q2**: Plot the price data considering specific date ranges and visual properties.
- **Q3**: Interpret the effect of the Ethereum merge on Ether prices.

## Part 2: Applied - Bayesian Classification (TripAdvisor Reviews)

- **Q4**: Load the data and create a 'helpful' indicator variable.
- **Q5**: Text processing and sentiment analysis on the `review_body` column.
- **Q6**: Calculate conditional probabilities based on the `sentiment` column.
- **Q7**: Apply Bayes‚Äô theorem to evaluate probabilities for reviews mentioning 'hotel' or 'beach'.
- **Q8**: Co-occurrence analysis for identifying combinations of common words in helpful reviews.
- **Q9**: Run Naive Bayes and Random Forest models to predict the 'helpful' indicator, and compare the performance.
