# MegaTelco Churn Prediction Project ðŸ˜”ðŸ’¸

## Overview

The project aims to develop and evaluate predictive models for identifying customers who are likely to churn from MegaTelco, a telecommunications company. The project is divided into three key exercises.

## Tools Used

### RapidMiner
- **Website**: [RapidMiner Official Site](https://rapidminer.com)
- **Description**: RapidMiner is a data science platform that provides various machine learning algorithms, data preparation methods, and model validation techniques. It's widely used for analytics teams looking to drive business outcomes with their data.

In this project, we utilize RapidMiner for data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.

## Exercise 1: Model Comparison

### Objective
- Compare two predictive algorithms: Tree Induction and Logistic Regression.

### Tasks
1. Plot learning curves for both algorithms based on **accuracy** and **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**.
2. Interpret the learning curves and identify which model performs better and why.

## Exercise 2: Tree Induction Deep Dive

### Objective
- Perform a detailed evaluation of the Tree Induction model.

### Tasks
1. Plot a graph to evaluate the model based on **generalization accuracy** and **AUC**.
2. Interpret the graph to identify optimal model complexity and assess for overfitting.
3. Convert the Tree Induction model into a Random Forest model to find significant variables based on information gain.

## Exercise 3: Expected Value Framework (EVF)

### Objective
- Develop a targeting plan for potential churners using EVF.

### Tasks
1. Choose the best-performing model and justify the choice.
2. Generate a **Benefit-Cost Matrix** and a **Profit Curve**.
3. Determine the optimal threshold for targeting customers.

---

## Guidelines
- Use formal and scientific language.
- Properly cite any academic or technical references.
- Utilize logarithmic scaling for data size representation in plots.

---

## Data Specifics
- A dataset of 14,088 customers is provided, divided into training and testing sets.
- Attributes include education, income, and various usage metrics.

---

## Goal
Provide actionable insights to MegaTelco for targeting potential churners with a special retention offer.
