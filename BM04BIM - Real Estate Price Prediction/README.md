### Overview
The second project at Double Zero Data aims to assist RealtyCheck, a real estate firm based in Rotterdam, in making smarter investments. The firm specializes in acquiring and selling properties, sometimes renovating them before listing for sale, and at other times identifying lucrative opportunities for quick sells. 

### Objectives
The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive automated system covering all steps of the CRISP-DM cycle to help RealtyCheck identify attractive real estate properties as soon as they hit the market. The system should offer strategic advantages by automating the evaluation of property attractiveness based on various metrics and data sources.

### Key Questions to Address
1. What is the potential added-value of this system for RealtyCheck?
2. What metrics should be used to evaluate a property's attractiveness?
3. What kind of predictive models are suitable?
4. What data sources are required for ongoing assessment?
5. How should the system's performance be measured and updated?

### Preliminary Task
As an initial step, a data set containing publicly available characteristics of Rotterdam properties has been prepared. The aim is to predict the listing price of a property into one of five different categories, based on various factors like location, area, and amenities.

### Kaggle Competition
The project includes a Kaggle competition where different models will be evaluated based on their accuracy. Further details can be found at [Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/realtycheck-bdma2022).
